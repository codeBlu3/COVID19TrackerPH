Hidilyn Diaz rides on her golden performance in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games. Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler MANILA, Philippines –  After conquering the 2019 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, Hidilyn Diaz does not plan to relax as she stays on track of her Tokyo 2020 Olympics bid. ""Nandoon kami one week before [the competition] and hindi kami nag-holiday. We just have to pray,"" Diaz told Rappler on how she's preparing for the 2020 Roma World Cup that will begin on Monday, January 27. (My team and I will be there one week before the competition and we didn't go on holiday. We just have to pray). The 2019 SEA Games gold medalist and her team left for the penultimate Olympic qualifier in Rome, Italy on Saturday, January 18. Diaz said she is aiming for a medal in order to tally additional ranking points and solidify her return to the quadrennial meet hosted by Tokyo, Japan from July 24 to August 9. The 2016 Rio Olympics silver medalist currently ranks No. 4 in the women's 55kg category that is topped by Chinese weightlifters Liao Qiuyun, Zhang Wanqiong and Li Yajun. But Diaz said she's currently running No. 2 in the qualifying standards as only one weightlifter from each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can compete in a weight class in the Tokyo 2020 Games. For the 28-year-old weightlifter from Zamboanga, winning a bronze in the 2019 World Weightlifting Championships last September in Pattaya, Thailand played a major factor in boosting her world ranking. In 2018, Diaz also secured the Philippines' first Asian Games gold in Jakarta, Indonesia. – Rappler.com   "
1,249701,"January 19, 2020",Relationships,[Two Pronged] A barkada that pries too much,Dr. Margarita Holmes and Jeremy Baer,"What happens if your friends ask too much about your relationship?    Rappler's Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master's degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr Holmes and Mr Baer, I am Hanna, 50, 20 years single. My boyfriend, “Phillipe” is 54, and lives in France. We are in a long distance relationship. We are very ok. The problem is my high school “barkada.” Twice a year, we meet to make sure we never lose touch with each other.  My 3 closest friends whom I see weekly also come from this barkada. Another problem is my “Europe group.”  My boyfriend is French. Two years ago, as my surprise birthday present, he arranged a European trip starting in Manila so I would be among my fellow Filipinos. His thoughtfulness made me so happy. Because we were the only intercultural couple, everyone noticed us, asking questions like my close barkada friends do. After they met Phillipe, they kept on asking about whether “something happened between us?” Too awkward for me to answer. My close barkada friends always ask me the same thing: “Oy, may nangyari na ba sa inyo?” (Has anything happened between the two of you?) I just ignore the question.  They are my close friends so they should know what kind of person I am – private and not liking those kinds of questions. Plus, it is always impromptu, when I am not prepared and no warning. It is like they want to shock me into telling the truth. I say nothing so they think nothing is happening physically The Europe group are different. When I don’t answer, they immediately tell me: “Dapat may nangyari na. Bading yan. Mag break na kayo pag balik mo sa Pilipinas."" (Something should have happened by now. He is gay. Break up with him.) We have been together for six years. I know Philippe, he is not gay. Like my high school friends, they ask in front of other people, which makes it doubly hard for me to ignore them.  Maybe I am imagining things, but I feel they are disappointed because I don’t open up to them. It’s as if gusto nilang makilig, but I am not cooperating. (It’s as if they want to live vicariously through me, but I’m not cooperating) I want to shout to all of them: “Leave us alone!” HELP! Should I leave my Filipino group? My Europe group? Hanna Dear Hanna, Gossip being a mainstay of so many social groups worldwide, it should not come as much of a surprise that both your barkadas are interested in your relationship with Phillipe, an interest that is perhaps enhanced by the fact that he is a foreigner. Were he Filipino, all sorts of information could in all probability be mined from your barkadas’ relatives, friends and acquaintances but his foreignness adds an air of mystery and enhances their curiosity. What is noteworthy is the difference in their approaches to the subject. The Filipinos seem merely interested in how far your relationship has gone whereas the Europeans appear keen that you should demonstrate your independence and leave Phillipe if he doesn’t measure up to the appropriate standard. Of course, this may be reading too much into what is after all a very abbreviated summary of your problem. What you don’t really address at all is your own attitude to all this. Sure, you tell us you are a very private person but you are 50, you have been friends with these people for years and you surely have developed coping mechanisms over all this time to deflect unwanted questions about your erotic relationships or indeed other aspects of your life that you have no desire to share. So why has this Phillipe business ruffled your feathers? You would do well to analyze this matter since your findings could tell you much about yourself and your relationship with your barkada friends. Since you are powerless to change the way your friends behave, the way forward seems to be to change yourself and how you react to their questioning and/or change your friends. All the best, JAF Baer Dear Hanna, Thank you very much for your letter. My hypothesis is that the anger you express is not really anger, but more sadness about people you believed were your friends but who thought nothing of betraying you. As you yourself said, “they should know what kind of person I am—private and not liking those kinds of questions”. Indeed, they know it, but that is not because they are close friends. If not, would they knowingly choose the most difficult situations for you before asking their uncomfortable questions? According to Aristotle, in his Nicomachean Ethics, there are three types of friendships: The first type, friendship based on utility, people associate for their mutual usefulness. The second type, people associate for the sake of pleasure. These are relationships one forms to facilitate or eventuate one’s own pleasure. The third type is grounded in virtue, an essentially selfless relationship, unbound by maintenance of utility or pleasure but sustainable over a lifetime Your “friendships” belong to the first or second category, certainly not the third. The third would mean being grounded in virtue and no one, by any stretch of imagination, would consider people in your high school or Europe group as that. If you want to shout to all of them: “Leave us alone!” by all means do so. I would suggest not to do it with your entire barkada/s present as this would merely be giving another opportunity for them to gang up on you. Bakit ka pikon? Concered lang kami sa welfare mo? — which is bullshit to the 9th degree, but no use being distracted by arguing about this. Best to just move on. Des, this mean you can never join them for meetings and parties? Not necessarily, as long as you “demote” them to friendships of the second type (so you can still enjoy being together) and not let them closer into you heart. A sad lesson to learn indeed, especially at our age but a lesson worth learning if we want friends Aristotle describes as belonging to Type 3 which surely all of us do, Hanna.

Anti-government protesters use a metal barrier to ram security forces taking cover during clashes in the central downtown district of the Lebanese capital Beirut near the parliament headquarters on January 18, 2020. Photo by Anwar Amro/AFP BEIRUT, Lebanon – Almost 400 people were wounded on Saturday, January 18, during running battles between Lebanese anti-government protesters and security forces in the capital Beirut, rescue services said. It was the heaviest toll since the protests erupted 3 months ago, with the Red Cross and Civil Defense saying 377 people at least were rushed to hospitals or treated at the scene. More demonstrations were expected later Sunday, January 19, as part of the wave of popular protests that has demanded the wholesale ouster of the Lebanese political class, which the activists condemn as inept and corrupt. Protesters had called Saturday for a week of ""anger"" as an economic crisis deepened while efforts remained deadlocked to form a new government to replace the one that stepped down under street pressure late last year. Saturday's clashes began after dozens of protesters, some concealing their faces with scarves, threw rocks, plant pots and other objects at anti-riot police guarding the road leading to parliament. Others tried to breach barbed wire barricades to reach the legislature building or charged police lines using traffic signs as weapons. The security forces responded with water cannon and tear gas to disperse the crowds. The Civil Defense said late Saturday 43 people were taken to hospital and that it had treated at the scene 114 others who were ""slightly injured or suffered from breathing problems."" The Red Cross said it had rushed 80 people to city hospitals while 140, including both protesters and members of the security forces, were given first aid at the scene of the clashes. The state-run National News Agency said around 30 people were detained following the violence but were later released. Meanwhile, security forces said they had opened an investigation after a video shared online showed police beating up people believed to be protesters as they were brought to a Beirut police station. The protest movement that has rocked Lebanon since October 17 is demanding that a new government be comprised of independent experts and exclude all established political parties. The previous government headed by veteran premier Saad Hariri stepped down on October 29 under pressure from the street but has stayed on in a caretaker capacity. The demonstrators have been denouncing rampant corruption in Lebanon and accuse authorities of being inefficient and motivated by personal and partisan gains. Political factions agreed on December 19 to appoint former education minister Hassan Diab as the new premier but have since squabbled over proposed ministers. The World Bank has warned of the worsening impact on the economy, saying the poverty rate in Lebanon could rise from a third to half of the population if the political crisis is not resolved soon. On Sunday, calls were posted online for new demonstrations near the parliament. – Rappler.com "

This file photo on July 28, 2015, shows Lotte group founder Shin Kyuk-ho in Seoul, South Korea. Photo by Yonhap/AFP SEOUL, South Korea – The founder of South Korea's sprawling retail conglomerate Lotte Group has died at the age of 97, company officials said on Sunday, January 19. Shin Kyuk-ho's reputation was tarnished in his final years when the wheelchair-bound tycoon was convicted of professional malpractice and embezzling from the firm to benefit his relatives in late 2017. He was sentenced to 4 years in prison but was allowed to stay out of jail on health grounds. Born in the southern city of Ulsan, Shin stowed away on a ship to Japan at the age of 18 to seek his fortune and established Lotte to manufacture chewing gum in Tokyo soon after World War II. The business later grew to include dozens of subsidiaries in the food, retail and hotel industries. Lotte is one of the biggest of the South Korean family-run ""chaebol"" conglomerates that powered the country's decades of runaway economic growth – but which are sometimes accused of murky business practices and overly-close ties with politicians. Shin's two sons made headlines in 2015 with a bitter public fight for control of the group, each accusing the other of mismanagement, personality flaws, and of manipulating their frail and aged father. His younger son Dong-bin eventually took over the reins as chairman but both he and Shin were accused of causing $72 million in damages to the group by renting out Lotte Cinema concessions at discounted rates to the founder's eldest daughter and mistress. The daughter was jailed for two years, while the mistress – a former model and actress 39 years Shin's junior, who came to his attention after winning a beauty pageant – was given a suspended sentence. Shin was also found to have disposed of company assets in violation of his responsibilities as chairman by the presiding judge in his 2017 trial. He had been suffering from dementia and other diseases of old age before his death, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. – Rappler.com "

Artivism Iloilo pays tribute to local market vendors in their murals. Photo by Marrz Capanang BEARERS OF ILONGGO TRADITION. Artivism Iloilo pays tribute to local market vendors in their murals. Photo by Marrz Capanang ILOILO CITY, Philippines – “Ang akun banwa yara sa nawum sing tienda (The face of our hometown is mirrored by our public market),” said Ilongga poet and artist Kristine Buenavista, one of the founders of Artivism Iloilo, as she reflected on their recent activity at Barotac Viejo’s Public Market. Buenavista was born and raised in Barotac Viejo. In December 2019, Buenavista and a group of young Ilonggo artists immersed themselves in the locale’s culture for Artivism Iloilo’s “Marka Merkado” – an initiative that seeks to empower local market vendors and small entrepreneurs through art and other programs. The event culminates with the painting of a handful of murals that pay tribute to the town’s humble artisans. A portmanteau of “art” and “activism,” Artivism Iloilo was first established in 2017, with the support of the British Council. Since then, the organization has partnered with various local government units, non-governmental organizations, and artists’ groups to make its advocacy possible: Bring art closer to the masses. ""We paint walls to break walls,"" is how Artivism co-founder and Ilonggo painter Marrz Capanang summarizes the vision of their initiative. They aim to champion public spaces as meaningful venues for art and expression, away from often restrictive and exclusive galleries and museums. GIVE IT COLOR. Artivism Iloilo paints murals in public places. Photo by Marrz Capanang GIVE IT COLOR. Artivism Iloilo paints murals in public places. Photo by Marrz Capanang “Artivism was made to raise awareness of pressing social issues through different forms of art,” explained Buenavista. “Mainly murals, complemented by other expressions like musical performances, poetry, and more. We also design community-based workshops, contests, and open sharing sessions with the communities.” In its third year, Artivism Iloilo partnered with the local government of Barotac Viejo to mount the endeavor, as part of the municipality’s annual Patubas Festival – the town’s harvest festival and town fiesta held in late December every year. ‘Vulnerable public markets’ Buenavista and Capanang shared that they deliberately chose Barotac Viejo Public Market to be their group’s new blank canvas in a bid to keep “traditional marketplaces alive.” MUSE. Lola Denia, one of Barotac Viejo's oldest manuglab-as, or fishmongers, stands in front of the mural depicting her portrait inside the town's public market. The work is by Ilonggo artist Ron Matthews Espinosa. Photo by Marrz Capanang Iloilo’s bucolic rural towns have seen rapid business growth this past year or so. Large national grocery store chains are putting up franchises in the town proper of a handful of strategic municipalities, competing with community public markets for customers and gradually putting most local vendors out of business. “As new and bigger businesses are coming into this small town [of Barotac Viejo], we hope that through showcasing the oldest and still active vendors of our community on the walls of the market, people will be reminded of the essence of the merkado: Ilonggo families directly receiving every peso we share or pay,” explained Buenavista. “Public markets are more than just a place to buy things,” Capanang added. “It contributes a lot in shaping our local culture – from trade to food to livelihood to community. Newer, bigger businesses are coming into the town, and it makes the small vendors and small enterprises anxious, overlooked, and vulnerable.” Artivism Iloilo sees local market vendors as unnoticed bearers of Ilonggo tradition, unappreciated despite their indelible contribution to their community’s culture and customs. “Local vendors have been keeping the traditional market alive. Some of them have spent almost their whole lives trading inside these marketplaces. We love highlighting the seemingly unseen and unheard of with the hope that it brings awareness,” Buenavista told Rappler. Late last year, one the first murals completed under “Marka Merkado” quickly went viral on social media: The portrait and story of 75-year-old Nang Maria, a vendor of local delicacies and kakanin (rice treats), also the town’s foremost maker of ibus – the Ilonggo favorite of sweetened sticky rice wrapped in palm or buri leaves–resonated with plenty of people online.  “To us, [Nang Maria] signifies the daily commitment of our local vendors to wake up and contribute in the local economy and the dignified lives of their families. Moreover, we admire her silent way of keeping our native delicacies alive,” related Buenavista. “She and the few remaining kakanin vendors in the public market are our own culinary culture bearers. She has also taught other younger women how to make these old-time favorites so they can have their source of income,” she added. The other murals included a portrait of Barotac Viejo's oldest manuglab-as or fishmonger Lola Denia; and a tribute to the town's nostalgic salesman of classic Pinoy toys like tiradors and jolens Lolo Rudy, who's become a part of most of the town's treasured childhood among others. All of these murals can be seen on various walls inside the Barotac Viejo Public Market complex. Among the artists Capanang and Buenavista collaborated with were Marge Chavez, Noel Epalan Noel Jr., Tiko Batiller, Yoyoy Timbad, Isaac Bravo, Sasha Cabais, Jayce Batu Boco, Mart Abela, Margaux Blas, Therese Faith Brasileño, Natsuki Dicar, Philline Dicar, Ra'z Salvarita, Elle Divine, Pam Reyes, Marvin Monfort, Ron Matthews Espinosa, Llywyllynn Timbad, Red Haraya, Kyla Buenavista, Angel Faith Balincuacas, and Jecko Magallon. Accessible art “When we imagined and envisioned Artivism Iloilo, our goal was to bring art beyond the usual avenues such as galleries and museums. We feel that art is meant for everyone no matter what walk of life they are in,” explained Buenavista. “Overall, we feel that public markets should not be undermined as venues for cultural and artistic activities. We hope that collectively, we are able to reflect on how we can support our local produce and kasimanwas (fellow townsfolk),"" she added. TRIBUTE.

The murals that are part of Artivism's Marka Merkado are set to be up at the Barotac Viejo Public Market indefinitely, with the support of the municipality's Mayor Nielo Tupas.

Talks of Even Nelle’s jump from San Beda to La Salle continue to swirl. Photo by Michael Gatpandan/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Where is Evan Nelle? That is the question even the San Beda Red Lions are asking as rumors of transfers start to swirl around their prized young point guard on Sunday, January 19. ""For now, we still don't know what Evan's plan is,"" admitted San Beda head coach Boyet Fernandez. ""He missed the last few practices and have yet to hear from him."" This development comes on the heels of Nelle's rumored transfer to the La Salle Green Archers in the UAAP, as first reported by Randolph Leongson of Spin.ph. Nelle has been a huge revelation for the retooling Red Lions after the departure of current PBA rising stars Robert Bolick and Javee Mocon. In just his second year donning the feared red and white, the 21-year-old guard did very well in filling Bolick's shoes as he finished with averages of 10.2 points, an NCAA-best 6.7 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 1.6 steals. However, the MVP runner-up's efforts fell short as the Letran Knights escaped their rivals with the NCAA Season 95 championship. Few years back, it was quite the opposite move for Bolick, who rose to collegiate superstardom after leaving the Archers to make a name for himself in the Red Lions' den. If ever Nelle does jump ship to Taft from Mendiola, La Salle will gain a worthy successor to the graduating Aljun Melecio, especially after the departure of top prospect Joel Cagulangan to the UP Fighting Maroons. The retooling Green Archers also recently tapped veteran mentor Derrick Pumaren as their new head coach. – Rappler.com  "

Photo by Ferdinandh Cabrera/AFP MANILA, Philippines – Over 8,000 fighters of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) had been decommissioned by the end of 2019, announced Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) Assistant Secretary Wilven Mayor. During the Presidential Communications Operations Office's ""Duterte Legacy"" event on Friday, January 17, Mayor said 8,879 out of 12,000 former MILF fighters were decommissioned from September to December 2019. Decommissioning MILF fighters, or the process of transitioning the 40,000-strong Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF) back to civilian life, is spread out over several years and was premised on the ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law in January 2019. (READ: Duterte tells disarmed MILF soldiers: Do not be disheartened) The government targets to complete the decommissioning of 12,000 fighters – 30% of the BIAF – by ""early 2020."" After an initial decommissioning in 2015, this batch represents the second phase of the MILF's normalization process. All 40,000 combatants are expected to be decommissioned by 2022. Aside from this, Mayor said 1,542 out of 2,000 firearms, along with 617 pieces of ammunition, were turned over to the foreign-led Independent Decommissioning Body as of 2019. According to Bangsamoro Transition Authority Education Minister Mohagher Iqbal, this is important because it embodies that the MILF's struggle ""will no longer continue in military terms but as active participants in...[the] democratic system."" On top of other forms of aid from the government, each decommissioned former rebel received P100,000 in cash and livelihood assistance. Agriculture exposure programs were also conducted for former MILF base and front commanders to help transform military camps into productive communities. Such aid is to set them on the path to normal, post-conflict lives. Along with the decommissioning, Mayor said a draft transitional justice and reconciliation plan was crafted. This plan involves ways to address the legitimate grievances of the Bangsamoro people, historical injustices, and human rights violations from years of conflict in the area.

In releasing their resolution, state auditors put an end to a 5-year review of a 2014 ruling and 2013 notice of disallowance that involved former officials and non-uniformed personnel of the Philippine National Police (PNP), along with contractors.

Motorcycles can cut in between vehicles, unlike 4-wheeled cars that can get you stuck – and stressed – in traffic.) Whenever she finds it hard to book a ride on Angkas, which is usually the case now since the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) imposed a 10,000-rider cap per firm, Lubiano would ""book"" habal-habal on Facebook. ""'Pag mahirap mag-book and walang available na Angkas within the area, no choice na kundi 'yung sa FB group or mga Habal sa daan,"" Lubiano said. (When it's hard to book and there's no available Angkas within the area, I don't have a choice but book on Facebook or hail one on the streets.) Mobility as service The prospects of a ""dignified commute"" in Metro Manila seem bleak in the short term, as the population growth rate continues to accelerate to a point that is beyond the current public transportation's capacity. According to a report by Bloomberg, driving a kilometer in Metro Manila has worsened in 2019. In September 2019, data from navigation app Waze showed that it took an average of 5 minutes per kilometer to travel around Metro Manila, longer than the April record of 3.8 minutes per kilometer. The population outlook for Metro Manila is not seen to decrease in the coming years either, as a United Nation report in 2018 showed that the metropolis is projected to have an annual increase of 1.9% in the next decade. Because of heavier traffic in cities, ""mobility as a service"" has been on the rise to provide an alternative mode of transportation that is faster than current options, according to a 2017 report by United Kingdom-based financial consultancy firm Deloitte. ""Mobility as a service"" is a model taken on by ride-hailing apps Grab and Uber, and the new motorcycle taxi firms JoyRide and MoveIt, along with Angkas. While more Filipino commuters shift to motorcycle taxis as their preferred mode of transportation because of its ability to ""beat traffic,"" the motorcycle-hailing industry may hit a dead-end, pending the passage of a law that would allow its permanent operations. The long and winding road to legalization As early as 2017, the government led the crackdown on motorcycle-hailing services of Angkas because it is illegal. (READ: Angkas-like: Motorcycle taxis in Southeast Asia hit bumpy road toward gov’t recognition) But even then, underground habal-habal operations were already widespread, it's just that Angkas was able to train the bikers to drive more safely. Romeo Maglunsod, who used to be a habal-habal driver before joining Angkas, said this in one of the public consultation hearings at the LTFRB in 2017. The point is to regulate instead of turning a blind eye, Maglunsod said. Under Republic Act 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, which was enacted 55 years ago, motorcycles can only be registered as private or government vehicles. Therefore, it can't be used by its owners to carry passengers and be paid for it. In the 17th Congress, bills amending the Land Transportation and Traffic Code was tackled by the House of Representatives and the Senate. House lawmakers passed their version of the bill in February 2019, but it remained pending under the Senate committee on public services, which Senator Grace Poe headed. In one of the Senate hearings in 2019, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto urged the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to just issue a department order to allow motorcycle taxis to operate, just like what it did with Grab and Uber (when the latter was still here). Arguing that legislation is the way to go, the DOTr started the 6-month pilot run, which was extended by 3 months to March 23, 2020. The point of this pilot implementation is to ""collect"" data that may be used by lawmakers when crafting the bill. However, on Monday, January 20, the inter-agency technical working group overseeing the test run terminated it – more than two months earlier than end of the extension period. The announcement was made just as Senate committee on public services was about to start its hearing on the matter. Proposals In the 18th Congress, there are at least 4 bills in the Senate and 14 bills in the House of Representatives seeking to amend the Land Transportation and Traffic Code. All of these carry more or less the same language: Section 7. Registration Classification. Every motor vehicle shall be registered under one of the following prescribed classifications: 
(a) XXX (b) XXX (c) XXX … (j) XXX and (k) motorcycles-for-hire. At the Senate, Poe, Recto, and senators Juan Edgardo Angara and Imee Marcos have filed separate proposals to legalize motorcycle taxis. Poe and Recto propose that motorcycles-for-hire must be less than 1,000 kilograms in weight, can travel more than 50 kilometers per hour, and has an engine capacity of 125 cubic centimeters. In the proposals of Poe, Angara, and Marcos, government regulators would be mandated to ensure the roadworthiness of motorcycle taxis before registration. No modification shall be made apart from the luggage carrier at the back, a saddlebag, a foot peg, and appropriate speed limiter and monitoring devices. In Poe's bill, there is a section on fare setting, specifically saying that LTFRB should ""determine, prescribe, approve, and periodically review and adjust"" reasonable fares for the operation of motorcycle taxi services. Meanwhile, Marcos, in her proposal, ""urges"" local government units (LGUs) to issue guidelines for the operations of motorcycle taxis in their jurisdictions. She also proposed that the Land Transportation Office require insurance for passengers and cargo. Similar measures have been filed by Muntilupa Representative Ruffy Biazon, Batangas 6th District Representative Vilma Santos-Recto, Quezon City 2nd District Representative Pecious Castelo, and Quezon City 5th District Representative Alfred Vargas. Meanwhile, majority of the bills in the House of Representatives include the proposal for motorcycles-for-hire to only be allowed ""for a limited period, with limited number of units and in specific routes only,"" which should be determined by the DOTr and the LTFRB, in coordination with LGUs. At least 11 congressmen argue that the transportation department should give priority to higher-capacity vehicles or mass transit sytems. This specific measures have been separately filed by Makati City Representative Romulo Peña Jr, Ilocos Norte 2nd District Representative Angelo Barba, Kabayan Representative Ron Salo, South Cotabato 2nd District Representative Ferdinand Hernandez, Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez, Bohol 1st District Representative Edgar Chatto, Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Luis Villafuerte, Cebu City 1st District Representative Raul del Mar, the late LPGMA Representative Rodolfo Albano III, and Isabela 1st District Representative Antonio Albano, and Quezon City 6th District Representative Tyrone Agabas. Instead of adding another classification specific to motorcycles-for-hire, Makati City 2nd District Representative Luis Campos' bill proposes to amend Section 7 (c) of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code to allow the registration of motorcycles ""either as private or public utility vehicle."" 'It's needed' As traffic congestion worsens, Impat and Lubiano said it's even more important for lawmakers to pass a bill that would allow commuters like them to have options to beat traffic, save their time, and use it somewhere else. ""[Motorcycle taxis like] Angkas helps commuters to beat the traffic, especially in Metro Manila. I can say, they can be considered as part of the solution,"" Lubiano told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino. ""Regulations lang din [kailangan] kasi sa super traffic ngayon. Heaven-sent 'yung may option ka na mas mapabilis 'yung travel time mo, given na 'pag rush hour talagang almost two hours ang b'yahe na 'pag sa Angkas 30 minutes mo lang makukuha,"" Impat said. (Authorities only need to regulate them. Because of the heavy traffic nowadays, it's heaven-sent to have an option that would make your travel faster, especially during rush hour when you would have to spent almost two hours, but which an Angkas ride can shorten to 30 minutes.) Public Works Secretary Mark Villar says some road projects will be done by 2020, removing private car volume along main roads. But in terms of public commute, majority of big-ticket railway projects are set to be in partial operations only by the end of the Duterte administration or in 2022. However, if commuters are to escape horrors of current state of public transportation between now and 2022, lawmakers will need to make motorcyle taxis stay on the streets – legally. – Rappler.com "

Trouble flared when police ordered the authorized gathering to disperse after officers conducting stop and searches on nearby streets had water bottles and paint thrown at them by angry crowds. A group of plainclothes officers who were speaking with organizers were then set upon by masked protesters, who beat them with umbrellas and sticks, an Agence France-Presse reporter on the scene said. Two officers were seen with bloody head wounds as colleagues shielded them from further attacks. ""Such appalling acts are not to be condoned,"" the force said in a statement on Facebook. Riot police swept into the area and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds. Brief cat and mouse clashes ensued with police making multiple arrests, including one protester who had blood streaming from the back of his head. Hong Kong's protests have raged for 7 months after being sparked by a now-abandoned proposal to allow extraditions to the authoritarian mainland, where the opaque legal system answers to the Communist Party.

At Sunday's rally, thousands gathered in the heart of the Central commercial district, chanting slogans such as ""Stand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom."" Some waved American, British and Hong Kong independence flags. There were many families and children present with a peaceful atmosphere until police ordered the crowds to leave. The frequency and ferocity of Hong Kong's protests have died down over the last month, but signs of the political unrest are everywhere, from graffiti daubed on walls to huge fences surrounding government buildings. The city's police force is now loathed by large swathes of the city, heckled by crowds both at protest sites and in their local neighborhoods. Critics accuse police of using excessive force, with no police officer disciplined or punished in the last seven months of protests. Police say they have used force commensurate with the levels of violence they face from hardcore protesters who routinely throw bricks and petrol bombs. The force has blamed viral social media videos of officers making hard arrests and media coverage for their plummeting reputation among the city's inhabitants. Among key demands of the protest movement are an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for 7,000 people arrested and fully free elections. Beijing and local leader Carrie Lam have refused further concessions and defended police tactics. – Rappler.com "

PResident Rodrigo Duterte makes his first appearance at the Sinulog Festival. Screengrab from RVTM CEBU CITY, Philippines – During President Rodrigo Duterte's appearance at the Cebu City Sports Complex for the Sinulog Festival here on Sunday, January 19, he promised funds for infrastructure and transportation projects in Cebu. “Cebu is greatly developing, but the problem is transportation,” Duterte said. “Your roads here are small. That's because Cebu is an old city,” he added. This was Duterte’s first time attending the Sinulog Festival since becoming president.   It’s also the first Sinulog under the watch of Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella. The first-term mayor was endorsed by Duterte and was carried by his daughter Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte’s Hugpong ng Pagbabago slate.The President entered the stadium, filled with about 5,000 festivalgoers at around 5:30 pm. Before speaking, he watched 2 Sinulog competition contingents. First was by the town of Alcoy. Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia danced the Sinulog with Alcoy for the President. The next performance was by Lumad Basakanon, of Barangy Basak, Pardo, Cebu City. Labella was able to unseat his rival, longtime scion Tomas Osmeña in the 2019 election with the help of Duterte. Fixing traffic was also one of Labella’s campaign promises when he ran for mayor. He is currently pushing for an intermodal mass transportation system that combines a monorail system with a bus rapid transit (BRT) system, as well as jeepney feeders. (READ: BRT to push through in Cebu, Quezon Avenue)  Dennis Uy’s Udenna Corporation was the sole-bidder of the monorail system. Uy is a known ally of Duterte. Duterte suggested building elevated skyways to fix traffic in the Metro, much like the skyways of Metro Manila.   In October, the Cebu provincial board passed a resolution declaring a traffic crisis in Metro Cebu, saying that gridlock and congestion was worsening every day on the island. Duterte traces his roots to Cebu City, where he won by a landslide in the 2016 election with 1.4 million votes over the 600,000 garnered by rival ex-Interior Secretary Manuel ‘Mar’ Roxas.   Cebu is the most vote-rich province in the country with about 3 million registered voters, according to 2019 Commission on Elections data. Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia helped campaign for Duterte when he ran for President in 2016.   On local infrastructure projects, Duterte told his local allies in Cebu, however, that he wanted them to only start projects that could be completed. This is a policy he has stated several times in the past regarding the remaining projects on his ‘Build, Build, Build,’ program.  Despite starting with an ambitious goal of 75 big-ticket projects, 3 years into his term, his list had to be tweaked after realizing that many of them were too expensive.   One such project was Duterte’s ambition to link all 3 major Philippine island groups.  Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia disclosed that Duterte’s ambition to link all of the 3 major Philippine islands just had too many obstacles (READ: Duterte's golden age of infrastructure will have to be completed by next president)Duterte, known for his free-wheeling extemporaneous speeches, his address here lasted for only 20-minutes. He spoke in straight Cebuano the entire time. While he touched on topics like corruption, officials he fired and, of course, drugs, he did not attack priests or the Church – something that has been a staple in his speeches. Sinulog is a cultural festival that follows the week-long Fiesta Señor celebrations in Cebu City. The Sinulog is a Cebuano dance which is believed to have originated from the pre-hispanic indigenous tribes of Cebu.Dancing the Sinulog is a modern way Cebuanos pay tribute to the Holy Child. At the end of his speech, Duterte reiterated that he would help Cebuanos find funds for their transportation projects. ""I'll help you find money to fund your trains. I'll help you find money that's my promise.""He also shouted the traditional, ""Viva Pit Señor (Long live the devotion to the Holy Child)!""

Dink was shot dead with two bullets to the head in broad daylight in central Istanbul on January 19, 2007, by a then 17-year-old jobless high-school dropout. The 52-year-old Dink was editor-in-chief of Turkish-Armenian bilingual weekly Agos and a fierce advocate of reconciliation between Turks and Armenians. His death became a wider scandal after it was discovered that security forces were aware of the murder plot, but failed to act. ""For Hrant, for justice,"" the crowds chanted. ""We have not forgotten and we will not let it be forgotten."" A giant picture of Dink was hanging outside the former building of Agos weekly, embellished with slogans reading: ""It is not late to be ashamed"" and ""This case will not be over before we say it is over."" Hakan, one of the supporters who joined the mourning, lamented that the murder had remained unsolved for 13 years. ""Hrant was killed here 13 years ago. For 13 years they haven't shed light on his death,"" he told AFP. ""We won't stop following Hrant's murderers. Whether they shed light on this or not, as Hrant's brothers, we will continue to be here."" Another supporter, Seyit Dogan, said: ""There are courthouses in this country but there is nothing in the name of justice."" Turkish police heightened security and blocked the street where the commemoration was being held to traffic. After the ceremony, carnations were laid on the sidewalk where Dink was shot dead. – Rappler.com "

'1917' picks up the Producers Guild of America film award ahead of the Oscars. Screenshot from YouTube/Universal Pictures LOS ANGELES, USA – Hollywood's producers handed 1917 their top annual prize Saturday, January 18m a reliable Oscars bellwether that puts the World War I thriller in the box seat for next month's showpiece event. The movie, which follows two British soldiers on a perilous mission across no man's land, has already scooped the Golden Globe for best drama, and has 10 Oscar nominations including for best picture. Collecting the Producers Guild of America (PGA) film award at a celebrity-packed ceremony in Los Angeles, director Sam Mendes said making the film was ""humbling, joyful and by far the best experience of my professional life."" In a bold filmmaking experiment, 1917 travels through trenches and crater-filled battlefields in what appears to be almost one continuous shot stretching for two hours. ""From the first day we actually shot – we did a six – or seven-minute take – I thought 'this is exciting',"" Mendes told AFP. ""And I didn't feel we ever looked back. We had difficult days but I never doubted it."" He added: ""It's certainly unlike any movie I've made."" The PGAs have predicted 21 of the past 30 winners of the Academy Award for best picture, including Mendes's 1999 victor American Beauty. Chosen by the 8,000-odd Hollywood movers and shakers of the PGA, the awards were attended by A-listers such as Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Nicole Kidman. Netflix programming boss Ted Sarandos was given the guild's historic achievement award for overseeing the streaming giant’s rapid rise in Hollywood. ""It's really hard to think that there's any bias against streaming,"" Sarandos told AFP, pointing to the firm's 24 Oscar nominations – including two for best picture (The Irishman and Marriage Story.) ""I think people are celebrating the films and the work, so it'll be great if we get the big one too."" Pixar sequel Toy Story 4 won for animated film, while CNN's""Apollo 11 topped both the documentary and TV movie categories. Comedian Billy Eichner poked fun at the lack of diversity in the television comedy category – won by Fleabag – announcing: ""The five white devils nominated are... "". HBO's Succession and Chernobyl won for television drama and limited series, adding to their Golden Globe wins earlier this month. And the same network's Leaving Neverland, a groundbreaking documentary that shed new light on child sex allegations against Michael Jackson, won the non-fiction TV prize. But organizers were left red-faced as, after a lengthy pause, nobody appeared to collect the award. ""All seems to be going well so far – excellently produced evening,"" joked Mendes. Pitt, frontrunner for the Oscars supporting actor prize, accepted a career award for his production company Plan B (Moonlight.)

I tried, I really tried.' But she admitted sadly: 'That's not the point of life. You've got to thrive.'  HAPPY COUPLE. In this file photo taken on on November 27, 2017, Britain's Prince Harry stands with now-wife Meghan Markle as she shows off her engagement ring while they pose for a photograph in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace in west London, following the announcement of their engagement. (Photo by Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP) LONDON, United Kingdom – Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan began a new life Sunday, January 19 as somewhat ordinary people with financial worries and security concerns after being stripped of their royal titles and public funding by the Queen. The settlement announced by Buckingham Palace on Saturday saw the 93-year-old monarch assume her painfully familiar role of managing a family crisis that threatened the very foundations of one of Britain's oldest institutions. The ""Megxit"" mess began when the young couple gave up their front-line family duties and announced plans to chart a ""progressive new role"" in North America on January 8. They did so without winning Queen Elizabeth II's permission or seemingly knowing how it was all going to work out. A mad rush of royal family meetings and screaming headlines in the tabloid papers culminated with a ruling Saturday that The Daily Telegraph called ""the hardest Megxit possible"". 'Absolutely unprecedented' The couple lost their right to be called ""his and her royal highness"" (HRH) – much as Harry's late mother Princess Diana did when she divorced Prince Charles in another family drama that upset the Queen in 1996. They further agreed to repay £2.4 million ($3.1 million) of taxpayer's money spent on renovating their Frogmore Cottage home near Windsor Castle. ""No royal has ever paid back money,"" former royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter wrote in The Sun on Sunday. ""It is absolutely unprecedented."" Harry was also stripped of the military titles and patronages he was awarded after serving two tours in Afghanistan with the British Army. But Arbiter said it was the loss of the HRH ""royal highness"" abbreviation that really made Palace history. ""Even when Edward VIII abdicated (in 1936) he dropped from being His Majesty The King to HRH the Duke of Windsor,"" he said. Arbiter noted that Princess Diana was not born a royal and had her HRH ""obtained through marriage."" 'Lost souls' Few know what Meghan – an American former TV actress with a huge social media following and A-list celebrity friends such as Oprah Winfrey and the Obamas – thinks of the British brouhaha about ancient acronyms. The 38-year-old frankly admitted on UK television in October that she ""really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I tried, I really tried."" But she admitted sadly: ""That's not the point of life. You've got to thrive."" Harry has also talked about still being haunted by his mother's death in a 1997 car crash involving a chasing pack of paparazzi. He and Meghan filed a series of lawsuits against UK media outlets in October – a step that predictably outraged the tabloids and renewed debates about the royals' role in public life. One these involved a UK paper that published fragments of a private letter Meghan had sent her estranged father Thomas Markle after her Windsor wedding to Harry in May 2018. Thomas told Britain's Channel 5 over the weekend that he found Meghan's decision to quit the royals ""embarrassing."" ""This is one of the greatest, long-living institutions ever. They are destroying it. They are cheapening it. They are making it shabby,"" Meghan's father said. ""I think both of them are turning into lost souls at this point."" 'The Queen isn't sure' The expensive lawsuits and the possibility that they might have to start paying for their top-notch security detail raise the immediate question of how they will make ends meet. Sky News said Prince Charles will probably continue paying his son some money from his private income. Harry has undisclosed millions of pounds in savings and Meghan has enjoyed a lucrative acting career. She is now also thinking of starting her own line of health and ""wellness"" products. The Sunday Times asked a royal aide if Harry and Meghan will be able to cash in on the ""Sussex Royal"" brand they trademarked in December. ""That is still one of the areas being worked through,"" the royal aide told the paper. ""That translates as: 'The Queen isn't at all sure',"" The Sunday Times wrote. But Arbiter stressed that Diana's ""global appeal"" was in no way affected by her losing the HRH tag. Harry was seen talking to a Disney boss in December about Meghan's interest in doing voiceover. There has also been speculation about the couple teaming up with Netflix. The Palace said the separate issue of who pays for their protection will have to be resolved by the UK government at a later date. Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave little of the game away when pressed by a British TV crew in Berlin on Sunday. ""I am sure that the royal family – it's been a round a very long time – will find a way forward,"" Johnson said with a smile. – Rappler.com "

Steve Parsons/POOL/AFP LONDON, United Kingdom – (UPDATED) Britain's Prince Harry expressed ""great sadness"" on Sunday, January 19 at the way he and his wife Meghan had to give up their royal titles as part of a separation settlement with the Queen. ""It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,"" Harry said in his first remarks on Saturday's historic agreement, made during a public address and posted on the couple's Instagram account. ""Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the commonwealth, and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible,"" he told supporters of his Africa-based charity for youngsters with HIV at an event in London. The settlement stripped Harry and Meghan of public funding and required them to repay £2.4 million ($3.1 million) of taxpayer's money spent on renovating their Frogmore Cottage home near Windsor Castle. Harry was also forced to give up the military titles and patronages he was awarded after serving two tours in Afghanistan with the British Army. But Harry said he felt ""utmost respect"" for Queen Elizabeth II. ""It has been our privilege to serve you, and we will continue to lead a life of service."" ""I will always have the utmost respect for my grandmother, my commander in chief, and I am incredibly grateful to her and the rest of my family, for the support they have shown Meghan and I over the last few months."" He also hinted at some trepidation at starting a new life away from his royal home. He and Meghan will spend some time in Canada before deciding whether to move to the United States or another country. ""We are taking a leap of faith – thank you for giving me the courage to take this next step,"" he said.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) stressed on Monday, January 20, that scientific data show a hazardous eruption remains possible ""within hours to days."" (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far) ""Ito pong mga management decisions ay sa local government [of Batangas]. Remember, we recommend...base sa ating mga namo-monitor, kung ano'ng posibleng mangyari sa bulkan at ano ang posibleng panganib...at ang local government naman ang magdedecide.... Maglalaban diyan 'yung personal interest at of course kapakanan din ng mga kababayan natin,"" said Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum Jr in a press briefing on Monday morning. (The management decisions are up to the local government of Batangas. Remember, we recommend based on what we monitor, what could happen to the volcano and what the possible hazards are, and the local government is the one who decides. The factors which may be in conflict are personal interests and of course the welfare of our countrymen.) Some residents have been wanting to return to their homes despite the risks, but several towns are on lockdown. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said at 6 am on Monday that 104,377 people are staying in evacuation centers, while 68,755 others were also displaced but are outside evacuation centers. (WATCH: Taal evacuees rummage for clothes that fit) In its 8 am bulletin on Monday, Phivolcs said ""steady"" emission continues from Taal's main crater. ""Activity in the main crater in the past 24 hours has been characterized by steady steam emission and infrequent weak explosions that generated ash plumes 500 to 1,000 meters tall and dispersed ash southwest of the main crater,"" the agency said. The sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission, meanwhile, was measured at an average of 4,353 tons per day. Phivolcs states on its website that SO2 is ""a major gas component of magma."" According to the United States Geological Survey, SO2 is ""released from a volcano when magma is relatively near the surface."" Volcanic earthquakes also continue. Phivolcs is using two networks to monitor these – the Philippine Seismic Network which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former. The Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 714 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12, the day the Taal unrest began. Of these, 176 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. From 5 am on Sunday, January 19, until 6 am on Monday, there were 23 volcanic earthquakes plotted at magnitudes 1.2 to 3.8, with one felt event at intensity I. Meanwhile, for the past 24 hours, the Taal Volcano Network recorded 673 volcanic earthquakes. ""Such intense seismic activity likely signifies continuous magmatic intrusion beneath the Taal edifice, which may lead to further eruptive activity,"" Phivolcs said. Phivolcs stressed that there must be ""total evacuation"" of Taal Volcano Island as well as high-risk areas within a 14-kilometer radius from the main crater and ""along the Pansipit River Valley where fissuring has been observed."" (WATCH: Fishermen risk lives for catch around restive Taal Volcano) Fissures or cracks had appeared in parts of Batangas province, particularly in the towns of Lemery, Agoncillo, Talisay, and San Nicolas, which are all high-risk areas. Ground deformation is one of the signs that magma is rising within the volcano. If a hazardous eruption occurs, Alert Level 5 – the highest – would be raised. This may or may not happen. (READ: TIMELINE: Taal Volcano eruptions since 1572) Phivolcs, citing the wind forecast given by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration, said that if the eruption plume remains below 3 kilometers, ash will be drifted to west and southwest of the main crater. If the eruption plume is 3 to 5 kilometers high, ash will also drift to parts of neighboring Cavite province. ""However, if a major eruption occurs during the day and the eruption column exceeds 5 kilometers, ash will also be drifted over Metro Manila, Laguna, and some parts of Rizal and northern Quezon,"" added Phivolcs. ""Residents around the volcano are advised to guard against the effects of heavy and prolonged ashfall. Civil aviation authorities must advise pilots to avoid the airspace around Taal Volcano as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from the eruption column pose hazards to aircraft."" So far, the cost of agricultural damage in the region of Calabarzon is pegged at P3.06 billion. Ashfall destroyed various crops.

Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – (UPDATED) On the morning of the scheduled Senate public hearing on motorcycle taxis, the inter-agency technical working group (TWG) terminated the motorcycle taxi pilot run more than 2 months before its supposed end. On Monday, January 20, TWG head Antonio Gardiola Jr told reporters that their recommendation to terminate the pilot run has been endorsed by Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade.  The pilot run was meant to serve as a basis for lawmakers to determine the viability of motorcycles as a mode of public transportation. Gardiola said that the TWG is finding it difficult to gather data because of legal impediments, and thus will be terminating the pilot run entirely. The termination came after two courts issued Temporary Restraining Orders against the guidelines of the pilot run regarding the biker cap that the TWG imposed. ""Magulo eh. We are resorting to legal rigmarole sa nangyayaring ito... Nai-impede ang study, we cannot gather data because of actions being undertaken by one of the players so it's better to terminate it,"" Gardiola said. (It's a mess.

The world's first platypus twin puggles born in captivity are shown together for the first time during a full health check at Taronga Zoo's veterinary clinic in Sydney, 28 March 2003. (Photo by Torsten Blackwood/AFP) SYDNEY, Australia – Prolonged drought and other effects of climate change are pushing Australia's unique platypus population towards extinction, scientists warned in a study published Monday, January 20. The river-dwelling animal has already disappeared from up to 40% of its historical range on Australia's east coast due to the drought, land clearing, pollution, and building of dams, which fragment their habitat, the researchers said. They predicted that if the current threats persist, platypus numbers will fall another 47-66% over the next 50 years. If projections about worsening climate change are taken into account, the numbers of the duck-billed, egg-laying mammal could plummet up to 73% by 2070, they wrote. The platypus is listed as ""near threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But the scientists from the University of New South Wales' Centre for Ecosystem Science said damage to river systems caused by years of little rainfall and high temperatures had worsened prospects for the animal. “These dangers further expose the platypus to even worse local extinctions, with no capacity to repopulate areas,"" said Gilad Bino, lead author of the study. The scientists said there is an ""urgent need"" for a national risk assessment to determine if the platypus should be downgraded to ""vulnerable"" status and to lay out conservation steps ""to minimize any risk of extinction.” The study is the first across all platypus habitat zones to establish a so-called ""metapopulation"" model while also projecting the impacts of climate change on the species going forward. The survey estimated the total platypus population had fallen by 50% since European settlement of the continent two centuries ago. An earlier study published in November 2018 estimated the population had fallen by 30% over that period, to around 200,000. ""Under predicted climate change, the losses forecast were far greater because of increases in extreme drought frequencies and duration, such as the current dry spell,"" Bino said of the latest report. The new study comes as unprecedented bushfires ravage vast areas of eastern Australia, fuelled by the drought and record-high temperatures. The platypus, which along with 4 species of echidna are the only mammals that lay eggs, is one of the world's strangest animals, with the bill of a duck, tail of a beaver, otter-like feet, and a venomous spur on its hind leg. – Rappler.com "

Yet government reduces our calamity fund by P22.9 billion since 2016   Dalawang punto ang tatalakayin ng editoryal na ito: Una, paano naghanda ang mga LGU? At pangalawa, anong prayoridad ang ibinigay ng gobyernong Duterte sa mga disaster? Sa pagputok ng Taal, inaasahang 40,800 ang mawawalan ng tirahan sa Batangas at Cavite habang halos 300,000 ang maaapektuhan kapag nangyari ang “imminent hazardous explosion” o ang malaking pagsabog. Nagbida nga ang Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte at idineklarang No Man's Land ang Taal Volcano Island. Sa totoo lang, ang huli, kahit magaling, hindi na maihahabol.   Nakatira sa isla ang 4,000 na matagal nang pinagbalakang ilikas pero hindi natupad-tupad. Aminadong hindi simple ang isyu ng pagre-relocate sa kanila. Malaking kabuhayan ang turismo at pagsasaka sa paligid ng bulkan habang mahalagang pinagkukunan ng isda ang lawa. Ubod nang ganda ang tanawin ng Taal – dahil dito, buhay na buhay ang komersyo sa Tagaytay. Kung ililikas nga ang mga taga-isla, dapat nakahanda ang isang engrandeng plano. Alam ng mga lokal na pamahalaang political suicide maglikas mula sa isla nang walang malinaw na plano, walang naitayong bahay para sa relokasyon, at walang pamalit na kabuhayan. Kaya’t ginawa nila ang isang bagay na napaka-Pinoy – ipinaubaya na lang kay Bathala ang lahat. Sa katunayan, walang plano ang Calabarzon (mga probinsya ng Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, at Quezon) – o kung meron man, hindi ito alam ng mga tao. Sa isang survey, sinabi ng 99.8% sa mga kabahayan na walang disaster management plan na partikular sa pagputok ng bulkan. Boom. May isang matagumpay na modelo sa disaster mitigation ang probinsya ng Albay para sa bulkang Mayon. Maraming aral na ipinamana ang Albay na kapupulutan sana ng Calabarzon pero mukhang hindi na nagamit ang mayamang karanasang ito. Sablay ang prayoridad. Nitong Byernes, Enero 16, 2020 umapila si Interior Secretary Eduardo Año sa publikong mag-donate ng esensyal na gamit para sa mga nasalanta ng Taal. Sabi ng mga nasa social media – hindi ba't ang laki ng badget para diyan? Totoong may pondo nga. Pero mula P38.9 bilyon noong 2016 naging 20 bilyon na lang ito nitong 2019, at ngayong 2020 ay bumaba pang lalo sa P16 bilyon. Apat na bilyon ang tinapyas mula 2019, habang umaatikabong P22.9 bilyon ang natapyas mula 2016. Aminado sina Deputy Speaker Mikee Romero at Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano na hindi nga sasapat ang pondo. Hindi kasya ang P16-billion calamity fund para sa Taal dahil halos kalahati nito ay nakalaan na para sa Marawi at Davao. Kailangan pang magpulong muli ang mga mambabatas upang ma-otorisa ang paggamit ng dagdag na pondo. Sabi nga ni Senador Ralph Recto tungkol sa madugong proseso: “Parang wiring ng kuryente. From request to release to procurement to delivery of reconstruction materials, easily 100 steps. Kawawa talaga ang mga local governments.” Sa madaling salita, isang daang tumbling pa para makarating ang tulong sa mga taong nasalanta. Tama si Año. Mas madali ngang mamalimos. Tama ba ang nabubuong big picture, Pangulong Duterte, Speaker Cayetano, Senate President Tito Sotto, dating budget secretary Ben Diokno at mga pinuno ng Calabarzon? Sa kabila ng pagiging #9 sa disaster-risk sa buong mundo ng Pilipinas, nasa gitna ng Pacific Ring of Fire, dinadalaw ng 20 tropical cyclones taon-taon, at 74% ng populasyon ay 'di ligtas sa disaster – nagbawas kayo ng budget sa kalamidad mula 2016 ng P22.9 bilyon? Sabi ng promotor nito na si Diokno, mas mainan na i-reduce ang budget sa kalamidad dahil may mga taong hindi ito nagagamit at bumababa ang spending. Meron naman daw supplemental budget na pagkukunan kung magkasakuna. Pero tumataginting na P8.2 bilyon ang budget para sa “confidential and intelligence funds?” O ang P10 milyon na kaldero sa SEA games? Sa harap ng nakaambang pagsabog ng bulkan, muli na namang aasa ang Pilipinas sa mga ginintuang pusong magdo-donate sa loob at labas ng bansa. Hindi pa ba tayo natuto sa Yolanda?

Prayoridad ang magpaganda ng imahe sa international stage. Pero hindi prayoridad ang kalingain ang mga nasalanta ng gyera, bagyo, lindol, at bulkan.

New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears,Agence France-Presse,"An expert says the fact that the virus had spread beyond China, to Japan and Thailand, was 'starting to make us fear that interhuman transmission is possible'  CLOSED. In this file photograph taken on January 12, 2020 a woman walks in front of the closed Huanan wholesale seafood market, where health authorities say a man who died from a respiratory illness had purchased goods from, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province. (Photo by Noel Celis/AFP) PARIS, France – A mysterious SARS-like virus has spread around China with more than 200 diagnosed cases in the cities of Wuhan, Beijing and Shenzhen, plus two people infected in Thailand and another case confirmed in Japan. Here are a few key points about coronavirus. What is coronavirus? The UN's health agency says that the outbreak of the disease in Wuhan is a never-before-seen strain belonging to a broad family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS. According to Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at Institut Pasteur in Paris, the new strain is the seventh known type of coronavirus that humans can contract. ""We think that the source may have been animals sold at market and from there it passed to the human population,"" he told AFP. The World Health Organization (WHO) says an ""animal source seems the most likely primary source... with some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts."" The outbreak has caused alarm because of the link with SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Fontanet said the current virus strain was 80 percent genetically identical to SARS. A total of 201 people have now been diagnosed with the virus in China, and the outbreak has already claimed 3 lives. Time to panic? Fontanet said that the coronavirus appears to be ""weaker"" than SARS in its current form, but cautioned that it could mutate into a more virulent strain. ""We don't have evidence that says this virus is going to mutate, but that's what happened with SARS,"" he said. ""The virus has only been circulating a short time, so it's too early to say."" As for person-to-person transmission – a key hallmark of pandemics – it may also be too early to tell for sure. But Wuhan authorities said over the weekend that some of the new cases had ""no history of contact"" with the seafood market believed to be the center of the outbreak. Authorities have pronounced the risk of human transmission ""weak"" but not impossible. Fontanet said the fact that the virus had spread beyond China, to Japan and Thailand, was ""starting to make us fear that interhuman transmission is possible."" Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper last week that the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be close to 1,700, much higher than the number officially identified. WHO has advised that individuals should protect themselves against the virus by thoroughly washing their hands, covering their noses when they sneeze, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with wild or farm animals. The best way of containing any disease outbreak is to rapidly confirm the source, according to Raina MacIntyre, from the University of New South Wales in Sydney. ""Tests are being done on animals in the Wuhan region and they should provide some insight,"" she said. Experts said authorities must be vigilant and monitor travellers coming to and from Wuhan for signs of breathing problems. Lessons learned? Fontanet said health workers in China had responded admirably by rapidly carrying out testing among patients and linking the cases to the market in question. ""We've learned some lessons from SARS. We're better armed and more reactive,"" he said. Adam Kamradt-Scott, an expert in the spread and control of infectious diseases at the University of Sydney, said China had ""has been quick to share the genome sequencing of this novel coronavirus"". ""This has enabled the identification of this new case in Japan,"" he said. Fontanet said that such transparency was different to the start of the SARS epidemic, when China ""hid the story for two or 3 months"" at the start of the outbreak. – Rappler.com "

The ""Parasite' cast accepts the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture award during the 26th Annual Screen Actors' Guild Awards. Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images/AFP MANILA, Philippines – The cast of Parasite, Bong Joon-ho's ""upstairs-downstairs"" movie about a poor South Korean family that slowly infiltrates a wealthy family's home, won the top prize at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Monday, January 20 (late Sunday, January 19 in the US). Parasite is the first foreign language film to take home the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture award. ""Althought the title is Parasite, I think the title is about co-existence and how we can all live together. But to be honored... it occurs to me that maybe we haven't created such a bad movie,"" said Song Kang-ho, who plays the patriarch of the cunning Kim family in the movie, after accepting the award. ""History has been made,"" read one of the SAG Awards' official Instagram stories showing a clip of Bong Joon-ho celebrating with the cast of the movie. The win, considered the SAG equivalent to ""Best Picture,"" comes amid discussions on lack of diversity and representation among Hollywood's elite award-giving bodies. A post shared by SAG Awards (@sagawards) on Jan 19, 2020 at 7:49pm PST US-based entertainment news sites noted that the audience – composed of Hollywood's biggest names on- and off-screen – gave a rousing standing ovation as actors Choi Woo-shik, Lee Sun Gyun, Park So-dam, Song Kang-ho and Lee Jeong-eun went on stage to present a clip of the film. Parasite won the Palme d'Or during the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. The exclusion of Parasite cast members in most acting awards is both dumbfounding and unsurprising. Alex Abad-Santos said on Vox, following the announcement of 2020 Academy Award nominees: ""The Academy that doesn’t have a good track record of rewarding foreign-language films and actors."" None of the cast members have nominations in the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes, or the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Film awards. They did get nods from the SAGs and the Independent Spirit Awards. This, despite the fact the film is a Best Picture nominee and director Bong Joon-ho has been nominated for Best Director by the same award-giving bodies. ""The lack of hardware or even nominations for Parasite’s cast is curious in that the movie has been the best-reviewed movie of the last year,"" said Abad-Santos. Director Bong Joon-ho later admitted that ""it is true that the momentum is building"" for the Oscars. The film, which merges comedy, drama and horror genres, follows a poor family as it infiltrates a wealthier household, and tackles the widening class gulf. Parasite is up for both Best Picture and Best Director plums for the 2020 Academy Awards. – with a report from Agence France-Presse/Rappler.com "

Reigning NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes steers the Kansas City Chiefs to the Super Bowl. Photo from Twitter/NFL LOS ANGELES, USA – Patrick Mahomes ended the Kansas City Chiefs' 50-year wait for a return to the Super Bowl on as the San Francisco 49ers routed the Green Bay Packers to advance to next month's NFL showpiece. Mahomes helped the Chiefs overturn a 10-point deficit to complete a convincing 35-24 win over the Tennessee Titans to take the American Football Conference Championship at Arrowhead Stadium. The reigning NFL MVP threw for 3 touchdowns and danced into the end zone for a superb individual score as the Chiefs successfully neutralized the threat posed by Titans running back Derrick Henry. Sunday, January 19 (Monday, January 20, Manila time) saw the first time the Chiefs advanced to the Super Bowl since their win over the Minnesota Vikings in 1970. ""I'm lucky to be a part of this team with all these guys – it makes my job a lot easier,"" said Mahomes, who finished with 294 passing yards and 23 completions. The win came one year after the Chiefs suffered an agonizing home overtime loss to the New England Patriots at the same stage of the playoffs. ""It's amazing, to be here to do it at Arrowhead, these people deserve it. We're not done yet,"" Mahomes added. ""We're going to get it."" Mahomes said the Chiefs – who had fought back from 24-0 down to rout the Houston Texans in the divisional round last week – had kept their cool after falling behind early on against the Titans. ""We just stayed with the process. It was like last week, we just stuck with the game plan and knew it was going to work out,"" he said. The Titans had reached the brink of the Super Bowl after a giant-killing playoff run which included wins over the New England Patriots and the top-seeded Baltimore Ravens. 'Great game plan' But despite starting strongly, the Titans ran out of ideas once the Chiefs defense contained powerhouse rusher Henry, who helped Tennessee forge early leads of 10-0 and 17-7 before the Chiefs rallied. Henry had few complaints after being restricted to a relatively paltry 69 yards and one touchdown after 19 carries. ""They just had a great game plan, man,"" Henry said after the defeat. ""They were coming off the ball, those guys were being physical. They played a great game today on defense and you know their offense, we know the type of offense that is: explosive, can score at any moment."" ""We just came up short. All the credit to them and good luck to them."" In Santa Clara, meanwhile, the 49ers clinched the National Football Conference Championship with a 37-20 rout of the Green Bay Packers that was more one-sided than the scoreline suggested. Niners running back Raheem Mostert rushed for 4 touchdowns and a whopping 220 yards as the run-oriented San Francisco offense punched hole after hole through a porous Packers defense. The game was effectively over by halftime with Mostert crossing for 3 of his 4 touchdowns – a record in an NFC championship game – in the opening two quarters as San Francisco opened up a 27-0 lead by halftime. ""I just woke up like it was any other game,"" Mostert said of his stellar display. ""It was just one of those games where once we all got in the groove we were like, 'Hey, let's keep it riding, keep it rolling' and that's what we did."" But it was another disappointing outing for Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who once again fell short in his pursuit of a second career Super Bowl title. Rodgers, regarded by many as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, finished with 326 passing yards from 31-of-39 attempts but also had two interceptions and was sacked 3 times. Niners counterpart Jimmy Garoppolo, meanwhile, was barely called upon as the San Francisco run game took over, making just 8 passes throughout the entire game for 77 yards. – Rappler.com "

This was Robredo’s response on Monday, January 20, when asked by reporters to comment on the call of her rival Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr to revise history books, which contain grim accounts of the 21 years the latter’s father ruled in the Philippines with an iron fist.

(READ: U.P. History professors slam Bongbong’s call to revise Marcos regime accounts in textbooks) But the facts are clear: the 21-year rule of the late dictator was marred by corruption, killings, torture, disappearances, and media oppression.

His daughter Imee Marcos is currently senator, while his wife Imelda Marcos was formerly congresswoman of Ilocos Norte’s 2nd District. Bongbong himself was a senator before he ran but failed to win as vice president in 2016, when Robredo defeated him by just  263,473 votes.

Unprompted, she offered to let me cut in in front of her. I felt like I had won the lottery. I took the woman up on her offer and thanked her profusely.  It was only morning but my day was packed and I was already running late. The woman’s gesture of kindness put me back on track. It brought to mind a similar situation from 20 years ago, only then I had the cart full of groceries and a man asked if he could cut in in front of me as he had just one item and was in a rush. I said yes but always looked back at that incident with annoyance, regarding it as a time when I had idiotically let someone get ahead of me. Juxtaposed, the two seemingly inconsequential events jolted me into an appreciation of the beauty and power of becoming older, and wiser. In my impetuous youth, it would have been beyond me to fathom how letting someone get ahead of me could be to my advantage.

My older self could see the view from the traffic helicopter, understand how giving way benefited the entire jam (including me), and derive zen from a broader perspective.

In this file photo taken on February 5, 2018 Angolan businesswoman Isabel dos Santos delivers a speech during the start of the new EFACEC Portuguese corporation's electric mobility industrial unit in Maia. Photo by Miguel Riopa/AFP LONDON, United Kingdom – An award-winning investigative team published a trove of files Sunday allegedly showing how Africa's richest woman siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars of public money into offshore accounts. The New York-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) worked with newspapers such as Munich's Suddeutsche Zeitung to reveal the ""Panama Papers"" tax haven scandal in 2016. Its latest series called ""Luanda Leaks"" zeros in on Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of former Angola president Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Angola's prosecutors last month froze the bank accounts and assets owned by the 46-year-old businesswoman and her Congolese husband Sindika Dokolo, which she described as a groundless political vendetta. ""Based on a trove of more than 715,000 files, our investigation highlights a broken international regulatory system that allows professional services firms to serve the powerful with almost no questions asked,"" the ICIJ wrote. The group said its team of 120 reporters in 20 countries was able to trace ""how an army of Western financial firms, lawyers, accountants, government officials and management companies helped (dos Santos and Dokolo) hide assets from tax authorities"". Dos Santos took to Twitter to refute the claims, launching a salvo of around 30 tweets in Portuguese and English, and accusing journalists involved in the investigation of telling ""lies"". ""My fortune is built on my character, my intelligence, education, capacity for work, perseverance,"" she wrote. She also blasted ""the racism and prejudice"" of SIC-Expresso, a Portuguese TV station and newspaper, and member of the ICIJ, ""that recall the colonial era when an African could never be considered equal to a European"". Dos Santos's lawyer dismissed the ICIJ findings as a ""highly coordinated attack"" orchestrated by Angola's current rulers, in a statement quoted by The Guardian newspaper. Dos Santos herself told BBC Africa the file dump was part of a ""witch hunt"" meant to discredit her and her father. The former president's daughter headed Angola's national oil company Sonangol. Forbes magazine last year estimated her net worth at $2.2 billion. Her father's successor Joao Lourenco forced her out of the oil company after becoming president in 2017. Dos Santos said on Wednesday that she would consider running for president in the next election in 2022. Western consultants The ICIJ investigation said Western consulting firms such as PwC and Boston Consulting Group were ""apparently ignoring red flags"" while helping her stash away public assets. ""Regulators around the globe have virtually ignored the key role Western professionals play in maintaining an offshore industry that drives money laundering and drains trillions from public coffers,"" the report said. Its document trove included redacted letters allegedly showing how consultants sought out ways to open non-transparent bank accounts. One confidential document allegedly drafted by Boston Consulting in September 2015 outlined a complex scheme for the oil company to move its money offshore. The investigation also published a similar 99-page presentation from KPMG. None of the companies named issued immediate statements in response to the investigation. – Rappler.com "

The country was behind most of its neighbors in Southeast Asia, overshadowed by Singapore (20th), Malaysia (43rd), Vietnam (50th), and Thailand (55th). However, it outperformed Indonesia (67th) and Laos (72nd). Japan was the highest-ranked Asian country at 15th, while China ranked 45th. The top 10 globally were Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, and Luxembourg. ""Economies with greater social mobility provide more equally shared opportunities –namely, an equal and meritocratic footing irrespective of socioeconomic background, geographic location, gender, or origin. There is a direct and linear relationship between a country's income inequality and its social mobility score on the index,"" WEF said. ""Low social mobility entrenches historical inequalities and higher income inequalities fuel lower social mobility,"" it added. Pillars The study considered 5 pillars of social mobility: health, education, technology, work, and resilience and institutions. The Philippines ranked 69th overall in the health pillar, as the country performed poorly on addressing teenage pregnancies and malnourishment. Access and quality of health care, as well as the country's life expectancy, dragged down the country's overall rank as well. In the education pillar, the country was 56th overall. Figures showed that inequality in the sector, teacher-pupil ratio, as well as the percentage of youth neither in the educational system nor employment were larger as opposed to the rest of the world. (READ: PH health care, infra, institutions among worst in the world – WEF) On the upside, the country was ranked quite high at 25th in terms of the quality of vocational training. WEF also found that adult Filipinos had the least amount of access to technology and ranked the Philippines at 62nd overall. Access to the internet and electricity were among the lowest ranked indices within the technology pillar. The Philippines was also found to struggle in work opportunities. The country ranked 52nd overall, as unemployment, female-to-male ratio in the labor force, fair wages, and working conditions were considered among the poorest in the world. However, the Philippines ranked first overall in terms of low wage incidence. Social protection and inclusiveness of institutions in the Philippines performed poorly in the WEF survey as well. The study showed that social protection spending and political stability were among the country's biggest problems. – Rappler.com "

Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta Representative Jericho Nograles accused the Independent Electricity Market Operator of the Philippines (IEMOP) of cornering millions of pesos worth of government-funded information technology assets ""without any competitive selection process.""

(READ: How does WESM work and affect electric bills?) It was created following the restructuring of the energy sector under the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001, which requires an independent operator to oversee WESM. ""From the documents submitted, it turns out that IEMOP has no experience, and worse, no assets to serve as the operator of the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market. No wonder there was no competitive selection process,"" Nograles said in a statement on Sunday, January 19. ""Laway lang ang puhunan.

Just 4 months after its incorporation, IEMOP took over WESM operations from the Philippine Electricity Marketing Corporation. But Nograles said there should have been a proper competitive selection process to determine which power firm was most equipped to manage WESM. ""The sweetheart deal made it possible for IEMOP to grow from P7,000 capitalization to become a multimillion outfit with a total declared income of more than P100 million for the end of 2018.

63,249764,"January 21, 2020",Rappler IQ,Can a quo warranto petition be filed against ABS-CBN?,Lian Buan,"(UPDATED) A 2009 Supreme Court decision contemplates the possibility of filing a quo warranto petition against a broadcast network which holds a legislative franchise. Is it applicable?   MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – With the franchise of broadcast giant ABS-CBN set to expire on March 30, or a little more than two months from now, the Lopez-owned television station may be facing another threat to its survival in light of a report that Solicitor General Jose Calida will file a quo warranto petition against its franchise. Citing ""unimpeachable sources,"" the pro-administration Manila Times reported on January 16 that Calida will file the petition to ask the Supreme Court to revoke ABS-CBN's franchise. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) said there are 11,000 jobs on the line, in what can be the worst threat to ABS-CBN since its closure and takeover during the Marcos Martial Law period. President Rodrigo Duterte has been out against ABS-CBN since his presidential victory, claiming that the network did not air his political ads despite payment during the campaign. In his recent rants against the network, Duterte told ABS-CBN to just sell, amid speculations that his campaign donor, Dennis Uy, is looking to buy. No deal has been made. Can Calida actually file a quo warranto? The Rules of Court Rule 66 of the Rules of Court authorizes the Solicitor General or a public prosecutor to initiate a quo warranto petition against a public officer deemed to be usurping his or her office, or having been found to not be qualified for office in the first place. This is what happened to ousted chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, whose supposed non-submission of Statements of Assets Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) reflected a lack of ""integrity"" which is one of the constitutional requirements for a justice of the Supreme Court. However, Section 1(c) of Rule 66 said the petition can also be filed against ""an association which acts as a corporation within the Philippines without being legally incorporated or without lawful authority so to act."" Constitutional law professor Tony La Viña said Section 1(c) will not apply to ABS-CBN because the provision attacks a corporation that was not ""legally incorporated."" ""My opinion is that Rule 66 applies only to invalid appointments and invalid franchises so [it] does not apply to ABS-CBN,"" said La Viña. Constitutional and political law professor John Molo said that there has never been a successful quo warranto case against a broadcast franchise. Molo added that while Rule 66 can be used, it doesn't mean it can lead to a strong case. ""This is perhaps the reason why to begin with, we have never seen it exercised this way before. Then again, the current Solicitor General has an unparalleled winning streak before this Supreme Court – most of them on very novel legal theories, strategies,"" said Molo. Is there precedent? The 2009 Supreme Court decision Divinagracia vs Consolidated Broadcasting System contemplated the possibility of filing a quo warranto petition against a broadcast network which holds a legislative franchise, using Section 1(c) of Rule 66. Petitioner Santiago Divinagracia asked the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to revoke the certificates of public convenience (CPCs) and other licenses issued to Consolidated Broadcasting System Inc. (CBS) and People's Broadcasting Service Inc. (PBS). The NTC licenses were requisites for a prior legislative franchise given to CBS and PBS. The same is required of ABS-CBN under Section 3 of its franchise law, or Republic Act No. 7966, which says ""the grantee shall secure from the National Telecommunications Commission the appropriate permits and licenses for its station and shall not use any frequency in the television or radio spectrum without having been authorized by the Commission."" In the CBS and PBS case, the Supreme Court said there is no law that allows an administrative agency such as the NTC to take away the franchise granted by Congress. In contemplating another way, the SC said in that case: ""There is in fact a more appropriate, more narrowly-tailored and least restrictive remedy that is afforded by the law. Such remedy is that adverted to by the NTC and the Court of Appeals – the resort to quo warranto proceedings under Rule 66 of the Rules of Court."" Molo said the case may be applied to ABS-CBN, but noted that in deciding Divinagracia vs CBS, and in fact denying the petition, ""the High Court very wisely sifted through the issues and saw the free speech and free pressimplications of what would have been normally a staid case."" ""At this point, and with what is at stake, the Court would be looking at the Institutional ramifications of a ruling on ABS-CBN’s case...ABS-CBN’s case will be a good chance for the Court to affirm to the public, and hopefully maintain, its role as the protector of constitutional rights,"" said Molo.  The SC also made a disclaimer by the end of that decision – that it was only ruling on the jurisdiction of the NTC. ""Other regulatory measures of less drastic impact will have to be assessed on their own terms in the proper cases, and our decision today should not be accepted or cited as a blanket shearing of the NTC's regulatory jurisdiction,"" said the SC. What happens to ABS-CBN after March? RA 7966, or the law that gave ABS-CBN its 25-year franchise in 1995, is silent on whether ABS-CBN can continue operating if March 30 comes and its franchise has not been renewed by Congress. The House of Representatives has been sitting on the bills seeking to renew ABS-CBN's franchise. This is despite both Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and House committee on legislative franchises chair Franz Alvarez saying there would be committee deliberations on the measures. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said a quo warranto petition is ""not needed"" and that the matter should be left to Congress. ""Ang franchise ay may natural deadline, di na kailangan ng quo warranto. Importante mag-umpisa na ang hearing, pag-usapan ano ang naging pagkukulang, ano ang dapat iimprove. At least lumabas doon ang issue,"" Gatchalian told reporters on Thursday, January 16. (Each franchise has a natural deadline, so a quo warranto is not needed. What's important is that hearings start, so that we can talk about what the gaps were, what can be improved. At least the issues are fleshed out there.) Constitutional law professor Dan Gatmaytan pointed out that the Divinagracia vs CBS case also said ""the viability of quo warranto in the instant cases does not preclude Congress from enforcing its own prerogative by abrogating the legislative franchises of respondents should it be distressed enough by the franchisees’ violation of the franchises extended to them."" Molo agreed, saying: ""Why not let Congress decide it first? After all, Congress can in effect cancel the franchise by refusing to renew it. Remember, the High Court has refused to act before when it noted that Congress had a pending bill that could provide the relief being sought by a litigant – and those bills didn’t have a time limit."" Before ABS-CBN, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revoked Rappler's certificate of incorporation – a matter remanded to the SEC by the Court of Appeals. It remains pending. Duterte has also made threats against the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Under the Duterte administration, the Prieto family of the Inquirer has had to face legal cases such as the takeover of their property Mile Long in Makati, and several tax cases against the family's other companies. – with reports from Mara Cepeda and Aika Rey/Rappler.com "

Photo by AFP BEIJING, China – A mysterious SARS-like virus has killed a third person, spread around China and reached a third Asian country, authorities said Monday, January 20, fuelling fears of a major outbreak as millions begin travelling for the Lunar New Year in humanity's biggest migration. The new coronavirus strain, first discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Wuhan has 11 million inhabitants and serves as a major transport hub, including during the annual Lunar New Year holiday which begins later this week and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel across the country to visit family. A third person was confirmed to have died and 136 new cases were found over the weekend in Wuhan, the local health commission said, taking the total number of people to have been diagnosed with the virus in China to 201. South Korea on Monday reported its first case – a 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan. Thailand and Japan have previously confirmed a total of 3 cases – all of whom had visited the Chinese city. No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but authorities have previously said the possibility ""cannot be excluded"". Health authorities in Beijing's Daxing district said two people who had travelled to Wuhan were treated for pneumonia linked to the virus and are in stable condition. In southern Guangdong province, a 66-year-old Shenzhen man was quarantined on January 11 after contracting a fever and showing other symptoms following a trip to visit relatives in Wuhan, the provincial health commission said. He is also in stable condition. Shenzhen officials said another eight people were under medical observation. ""Experts believe that the current epidemic situation is still preventable and controllable,"" the Guangdong health commission said. Five other people have been put in isolation and tested in eastern Zhejiang province. At Beijing's crowded central railway station, some travellers wore masks as a precaution but were not too concerned about the virus. ""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven't taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,"" said Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager who was heading home to the northern region of Inner Mongolia for the Lunar New Year. A 26-year-old woman surnamed Guo, who was heading to northeast Liaoning province, said she and her friends generally avoided crowded areas and have been reminding each other to wear masks. Detection measures A seafood market is believed to be the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan, but health officials have reported that some patients had no history of contact with the facility. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Twitter Monday that ""an animal source seems the most likely primary source"" with ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts"". It said the new cases in China were the result of ""increased searching and testing for (the virus) among people sick with respiratory illness"". Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper published Friday that the number of cases in the city was likely to be closer to 1,700, much higher than the number officially identified. Wuhan authorities said they have installed infrared thermometers at airports, railway stations and coach stations across the city. Passengers with fevers were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions. State TV footage aired Monday showed medical staff working inside an isolation ward at a Wuhan hospital in full-body suits. Authorities in Hong Kong have also stepped up virus detection measures at border crossings, including rigorous temperature checks for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland. Passengers are also being screened at some airports in Thailand and the United States. In Wuhan, 170 people are still being treated at hospital, including nine in critical condition, the city health commission said, adding that 25 people have been discharged so far. Chinese state media moved to calm the mood as discussion about the coronavirus spreading to other Chinese cities swelled on social media.

The university says they're investigating.  PROLONGED PROBE? The De La Salle College of Saint Benilde. File photo by Jee Geronimo/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – One evening in January 2019, AK Paras met his friend Andy Tan (not his real name) at the gym. Both senior students in the Export Management Program of the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde (CSB), they had only one topic for small talk as graduation neared: thesis. The exchange was casual, with Paras saying he had gone on a leave of absence since June 2018 to work on their family businesses. Tan voluntarily told Paras that his thesis group had paid P20,000 to guarantee passing the class. He admitted contributing P5,000. The story bothered Paras, whose father helps vet appointed officials for a government office, but he shrugged it off. It was only one case, he thought. Eight months later in September, Paras dined with friends in Poblacion, Makati to celebrate an engagement. One of his companions was Enzo Santos (also not his real name), another senior in CSB’s Export Management Program. As they were dining in an open food court, the topic of conversation steered towards thesis once more. Echoing Tan’s narrative, Santos said his group also paid P20,000 to pass their class. Both bribing incidents apparently occurred in the October to December trimester of 2018. Their thesis groups were different but the faculty member they accused of masterminding the scheme was the same: thesis coordinator Ariel Pineda. CSB prides itself with being the pioneer school in the Philippines to offer the degree Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a Major in Export Management. In the private sector, the program’s alumni have landed in key positions in local and multinational shipping companies, while in government, they have secured posts in one of President Rodrigo Duterte’s most despised departments for alleged corruption: the Bureau of Customs. Pineda was a well-known professor in the Export Management Program, Paras said. He was not “legendary” in the jargon of college kids looking for legacy professors, but he knew what he was talking about and he communicated it well to his students. A matter of integrity Paras decided to persuade his friends to file a complaint. But the two were afraid that if they stood up, their college credentials would be withdrawn. On October 3, 2019, Paras went ahead with what the two had told him and filed a complaint with the student government, which, in turn, forwarded it to the CSB administration. “If we do not speak up, who else will? It’s also my personal crusade to fight corruption. It's very much against the values of La Salle,” Paras told Rappler in an interview on December 4, 2019. The latest CSB Student Handbook counts “integrity” as among the primary values that make a good student. The school defines integrity as “the consistent upholding of one’s commitment to the common good in thoughts, words and deeds.” Three months since filing his complaint, which we obtained a copy of, the investigation is still ongoing with no sanctions for either the alumni involved or Pineda, who has since been promoted to become the Export Management Program’s chairperson. Rappler sought the side of Pineda through his official email address on January 2, but he said he still had to “consult” with his “superior.” We followed up on January 3, January 19, and January 23. We also called the Export Management Program to reach him on Thursday, January 23, but he was not in the department. There were no further replies to our emails as of posting time. We will update this story once we get a reply from him. Student collusion  ACCUSED. Ariel Pineda is a professor at De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde's Export Management Program. Photo from CSB Export Management Society Facebook page Based on chat conversations between Paras and Tan shown to Rappler, the alumni themselves had asked if they could bribe their way through in their thesis project. To aid in his complaint, Paras asked Tan via Facebook chat how the transaction happened. “Sobrang daming groups throughout ilang years (There were so many groups throughout many years),” said Tan in an exchange they had on Sunday, September 29, 2019 beginning at 6:29 pm. Paras asked whether Pineda “offered” the cheating route to their group. Tan said they wanted it. “Kami yung lumapit bro. Yung mga students na tamad kasi bro gusto,” Tan said. (We approached him. It was because the lazy students wanted it.) Tan told Paras they had to ask around and that Pineda “chose” which groups he would allow to pay him, adding that, “'Pag mga babae 'ata ayaw niya 'pag mukhang madaldal (It seems like he didn't want women who looked chatty).” Tan then said in the chat that they did not directly give the money to Pineda, but instead to a “middleman” so that Pineda wouldn’t be traced as the final recipient. “It’s bigger than it looks pre. Bro buong school bro. Hawak niya buong faculty. Plantsado na lahat 'yun bro,” Tan said. (It’s bigger than it looks. It’s the entire school. He has the entire faculty in his hands. It’s all already arranged.) In their chat, Tan admitted further culpability, adding that his and his group mates' parents knew about what they had done. “Kasi 'yung students naman may gusto, hindi naman si Pineda bro e. So kami yung mahuhuli dun,” Tan said. (The students wanted it, not Pineda. So we would be the ones who would get caught in the end.) The same evening on September 29, 2019, Paras sent a Facebook message to his second potential witness, Enzo Santos, to aid him in filing the complaint. Instead of conversing via Facebook chat like Tan, Santos called Paras at 11:21 pm. The call lasted 18 minutes. In his complaint, Paras recounted that Santos said he would only cooperate if he was assured of getting his diploma even after coming out with his story. The next day, Paras called Santos again through Facebook. Paras further recounted in his complaint what Santos had told him, confirming that there was a middleman identified as a certain Matthew Cotas, an Export Management student, too. In the same complaint, Paras said that ""Mr Cotas created a Facebook messenger group chat last October 11, 2018...for purposes of communication on how the bribe money will be given to Mr Pineda."" Santos also told Paras that the first message in the group chat came from Cotas when he said “G?” – short for game, or willingness to engage in the ""anomalous transaction."" Santos then said they were instructed to deposit P20,000 to a BDO checking account belonging to someone else. As proof, Santos forwarded a photo of the deposit slip to Paras. The transaction was completed on October 15, 2018 at 4:20 pm. Paras attached the deposit slip as evidence in his complaint.  MIDDLEMAN? Paras is sent this receipt by Santos as proof of their payment to pass. Photo from AK Paras Santos graduated in March 2019, while Tan graduated in October 2019. Rappler sought the side of Tan and Santos on December 3, and Cotas on December 9, through Facebook. We reached out to all of them again on January 23 through their Facebook messenger accounts. We obtained Tan's cellphone number and sent him a text message on January 23 for comment. They have not replied as of this writing. Thesis demands  COMPLICATED. A portion of a thesis syllabus in CSB's Export Management program in 2016. The thesis for the program is called the export project. It's a two-trimester subject divided between export project 1 and export project 2. The first requires aspiring exporters to craft and present a detailed feasibility plan, and the second, usually the easier one, entails accounting. Because of project 1's difficulty, they heard about more students trying to bribe their way out. This was the case for the group of Tan and Santos. Preparing a feasibility study is a burdensome task. Rappler obtained a 2016 syllabus, which indicated the goal of the project as students studying the feasibility of exporting a product to another country. The feasibility study also required students to pretend to be a company, define goals, invent their company structure, pitch a company location, have a vision and mission, and present diagrams for market matrices. The other parts with their own branches of requirements included: marketing the product, producing them, and projecting financial assumptions for their imaginary business. After completing requirements, the students have to defend the feasibility project before a panel, comprised of two people who are either a faculty member or a professional. These panelists can pass, fail, or ask for revisions from students. They usually ask for changes, entailing multiple returns for presentations to mirror the real process of pitching in the industry. These panelists are invited by the thesis coordinator – in the case of Tan and Santos, it was professor Pineda. Stories of short-cuts Rappler spoke with a frequent panelist, Tom Salazar (not his real name), who said he had seen two instances where the process was violated under Pineda as thesis coordinator. He remembered one group in 2017, which, despite his asking them to revise their thesis, did not do so. Salazar refused to pass them, but another professor asked him to approve the students' project. ""It was really rude. But then I signed, and was like, 'Oh well, if that's how things work here,'"" he said. In November 2018, he remembered being asked by Pineda to sit in as a panelist again. Even before the presentation of the students started, the panelists were given the approval sheets. For that defense, Salazar said it was the department secretary who distributed the approval sheets. ""She told me, 'Sir, just sign the approval sheet, so that you wouldn't be bothered anymore,'"" Salazar recalled the secretary telling him. When he asked why, the secretary said it was Pineda's instruction. Puzzled by the clear breach of the process, Salazar said he walked to the office to confirm that this was really Pineda's instruction. Salazar said Pineda confirmed it. High-profile investigation  INVITATION TO TESTIFY. The dean asks students to testify against an administrator who continuously receives payments and victimizes thesis advisees. Sourced photo Paras’ complaint has become the most high-profile probe in the school in recent years as it involves no less than a program head. When Paras consulted student council officers, one of them who spoke with Export Management students said that the scheme was already an “open secret.” Using Facebook, Paras even reached out to the former president of CSB, Brother Dennis Magbanua, who then put him in direct contact with the chancellor's special assistant, lawyer Domingo “Sonny” Reyes Jr. With the endorsement of the student government, Paras filed the complaint with Siegfred Javelosa, the dean of CSB’s School of Management and Information Technology (SMIT). Javelosa then called on students to step forward. In his November 2019 letter to Tan and Santos, he promised immunity if they complete the complaint filed by Paras. “[The] Export Management Program is currently riddled with bad reputation,” Javelosa said. “I have heard of an administrator who continuously receives payments and victimizes their thesis advisees. This corrupt practice cannot be tolerated by our school. We are an educational institution with values and we cannot allow our students to be victims of this unacceptable practice,” Javelosa said. He then warned that if the scheme wasn’t stopped, more students would be victimized and that it would eventually lead to the “downfall” of the program. CSB has issued a notice to explain to Pineda. Once he responds, the college can decide on the appropriate sanction. According to CSB’s Personnel Manual seen by Rappler, there are 3 possible offenses: offenses against CSB’s interests and approved policies, offenses against persons, and offenses against public morals. After evaluation of the case, the school can reprimand, suspend, or dismiss Pineda. Last January 2, Rappler emailed Javelosa as CSB’s School of Management and Information Technology dean, to seek his comment since the program falls under him. Receiving no reply, we called his office on January 23. He declined to give comment, but said he would reply to Rappler's email. As of writing there has been no reply. Rappler then reached out to Brother Edmundo Fernandez, the current president of CSB. In a statement sent to Rappler, he confirmed they were investigating the case. CSB's full statement reads: ""The De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde is a Catholic educational institution that believes in fairness, objectivity, and consistency in all its dealings. To this end, the right of every member of the community is respected and upheld at all times. Recently, there had been media releases circulating both in Facebook and the on-air platform regarding a complaint filed by a former student of our college against a chairperson of a program through the student central government. The College would like to state that the case is currently being investigated by our college authorities with utmost diligence in full compliance with the due process of the law and appropriate actions will be undertaken based on substantial evidence gathered. As a Christian institution, we will exert effort to uncover the truth and will exercise prudence in the investigation process within the bounds of the law and with due regards to the right of all the parties concerned."" – Rappler.com "

Roger Federer begins his bid for a 21st Grand Slam on a high note. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Roger Federer has never lost in the first round at the Australian Open since his debut 20 years ago, and the Swiss great kept his incredible record intact, attributing ""old-school work ethic"" for his success. The 38-year-old swatted aside Steve Johnson, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2, on Monday, January 20, in Melbourne Park to race into the second round, kickstarting his bid for a 21st Grand Slam title in immaculate style. Federer said ahead of the tournament that he had low expectations at the opening Grand Slam of the season after missing the warm-up ATP Cup to spend more time with his family. It left him short of match practice, but it did not show on Rod Laver Arena against his American foe. ""I think for me really the first 3 rounds are key to get going, to get used to the pressure, stay calm, when to save breakpoint or 30-all points or whatever it may be,"" he said. ""This is sort of the unknown that can be a little bit scary at times."" ""But today, there was none of that because I broke early each set and was able to get on a roll, play freely after that."" The crowd favorite knew he needed to get out of the blocks fast against the world No. 75 and that was what he did, racing to a 4-1 lead in the opening set before a 10-minute interruption for the roof to be shut due to rain. Federer returned and wrapped up the set in just 27 minutes. Johnson, known for his big forehand and slice backhand, again gave away service breaks early in the next two sets and there was no way back against a man who delivered some jaw-dropping returns and forehands. He will next play either French qualifier Quentin Halys or Serbian Filip Krajinovic, admitting ""I have to be careful."" ""Round-by-round, point-for-point mentality. I know other guys that are playing extremely well right now so I think it's just important to stay very calm about things."" 'Learning from mistakes is key' Seeded No. 3, Federer is gunning for not only a 21st Slam title but his seventh in Australia, having most recently tasted success at Melbourne Park in 2018. His earliest exit in Australia since 2000 has been the third round, and the Swiss star said hard work was key to his longevity. ""At the end of the day, old-school work ethic, there is nothing wrong with that,"" he said. ""I do believe if you're in a slump, not feeling well, whatever it may be, knowing how to train hard, when to train hard, with who to train hard, there is nothing wrong when it goes to those things."" ""And learning from your mistakes is key, as we remember our losses more than our wins. It's just important that when you do lose, you know, you really make the most of it, because it's actually an opportunity."" Despite his age, Federer remains a competitive force and won 4 singles titles last year. But he failed to add another Grand Slam with his closest call coming in the Wimbledon final, where he lost a five-set epic to Novak Djokovic. In contrast to his 2019 major drought, Djokovic and Rafael Nadal won two apiece, with the Spaniard moving within one Slam title of Federer's record 20. – Rappler.com "

Backed by other House leaders, Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano made the proposal on Monday, January 20, the first session day of the 18th Congress in 2020, so that they could “listen” to the residents displaced by the volcanic eruption. “The leadership of the House is proposing that we hold our session on Wednesday at the Batangas Convention Center… The proposal is that we move that we committee of the whole and listen to different representatives from all over Laguna, Cavite, Batangas, listen to the first responders, listen to those who are directly affected,” Cayetano said.

Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou leaves her house on her way to a court appearance on January 17, 2020 in Vancouver, Canada. Photo by Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images/AFP VANCOUVER, Canada – A senior Huawei executive whose arrest in Vancouver led to a breakdown in Canada-China relations headed to court on Monday, January 20, to fight extradition to the United States. Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer and eldest daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, is wanted by US authorities for alleged fraud. In order to secure her freedom, the ""princess of Huawei"" must convince a Canadian judge that the US charges – linked to alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran – would not stand up in Canada and are politically motivated. The US alleges Meng lied to HSBC about Huawei's relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran. ""Simply put, there is evidence she deceived HSBC in order to induce it to continue to provide banking services to Huawei,"" the justice department said in court filings. Meng has denied the allegations. She has been out on bail, living in one of her two Vancouver mansions for the past year, awaiting trial. The justice department will say in arguing for her extradition that the US accusations against Meng would be considered a crime in Canada if they had occurred there. This is a key test known as double criminality. Her lawyers, however, will counter that the misrepresentations do not amount to fraud, but rather are an attempt by the United States to enforce its sanctions against Iran -- which Canada has not matched. Caught up in US-China row Meng's arrest during a Hong Kong-to-Mexico flight stopover in December 2018 put the 47-year-old at the centre of the US and China's battle over the technology giant's growing global reach. It also stuck Canada in the middle of a trade row between the world's two largest economies, resulting in the arrests of two Canadians and restrictions on its agricultural shipments to China. China's ""arbitrary detentions,"" according to Ottawa, of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor on espionage suspicions, nine days after Meng was taken into custody, have been widely interpreted as retribution by Beijing aimed at pressuring Canada to free Meng. China's ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, has said Meng's release was a ""precondition"" for improved bilateral ties. Ottawa, however, has maintained it will not interfere in the legal process. The hearing is scheduled to last five days. But if the US accusations are found to also be a crime in Canada, it will proceed to a next phase in June, when defense arguments that authorities conspired to nab Meng as part of a ""covert criminal investigation"" would be heard. Later in the year, the court is also scheduled to weigh evidence in the US fraud case. Any appeals risk drawing out the proceedings for years. According to court documents, Huawei allegedly controlled the operations of Skycom in Iran. Its staff used Huawei email accounts and security badges, and its bank accounts were controlled by Huawei, the Crown said. But Meng told HSBC executives in a presentation in 2013 that Huawei no longer owned Skycom and that she had resigned from Skycom's board. From 2010 to 2014, HSBC and its American subsidiary cleared more than US$100 million worth of transactions related to Skycom through the US. Stunting Huawei's rise Ren Zhengfei has suggested that the case is part of a US plot to crush Huawei, which it sees as a security risk. Founded by the former People's Liberation Army engineer in 1987, Huawei has grown into one of the world's biggest technology firms. Meng is ""like a small ant caught between the collision of two giant powers,"" Ren told broadcaster CNN. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who'd hoped when he came to power in 2015 to deepen Canada's economic ties with China, prevailed on the US for help. He told broadcaster TVA last month that he urged US President Donald Trump not to finalize a trade deal with China ""that doesn't settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians."" Trump still went ahead and signed a ""phase one"" trade deal with China last week. Former Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien and his ex-deputy John Manley, meanwhile, have urged Trudeau to simply release Meng in a ""prisoner swap"" for Spavor and Kovrig, in order to normalize relations with China. That, however, risks legitimizing Beijing's ""hostage diplomacy"" tactics, according to leading extradition experts consulted by AFP. – Rappler.com "

Senators grill motorcycle taxi technical working group head Antonio Gardiola Jr regarding the termination of the pilot run. Photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Senate committee on public services questioned the motive of the inter-agency technical working group (TWG) after it decided to terminate the motorcycle taxi pilot run without consulting stakeholders, reading it as retaliation. In its recommendation to terminate the pilot run, the TWG said that some actions by motorcycle ride-hailing firm Angkas and its bikers served as ""obstacles"" to the study, including the rally against the new cap and the petitions for a Temporary Restraining Order against the guidelines. The extension of the pilot run forced Angkas to slash up to 17,000 of its bikers. TWG head Antonio Gardiola Jr said the subsequent Temporary Restraining Orders issued against the pilot run guidelines made it hard for them to gather data, prompting them to terminate the pilot run entirely. But during the hearing on Monday, January 20, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto said the cap on the motorcycle taxis seemed arbitrary and lacked public consultation. He also found that the tone of the recommendation was laced with anger. ""Kaya kayo na-TTRO ng korte. yun ang dahilan. Tapos ngayon na na-TRO kayo, galit naman ang pinapakita ninyo. [Maliwanag] sa dokumentong ito eh, puro galit din eh. Dahil nagrally laban sa inyo galit na ka agad kayo,"" Recto said. (That's why the courts issue TROs against you. And now that they issued the TRO against you, you're showing anger. It is so clear in this document that you are angry. Just because they rallied against you, you're lashing out.) Senator Sherwin Gatchalian agreed with the sentiment, saying the failure of the TWG to conduct its data-gathering activities should not be blamed on legal impediments. ""Paghihiganti ho 'tong ginawa niyo eh. Wala ho kasing basehan 'to lahat eh (This is retaliation. This does not have any basis),"" Gatchalian said. After the hearing, committee chair Senator Grace Poe expressed the same thoughts. ""Alam mo ang nangyayari dito? Gantihan. Kasi naiinis sila dahil nagrarally ang ibang kompanya, naiinis sila dahil nagfifile ng kaso sa kanila, kaya nila ginawa ito... Sobrang nakakadismaya na ganyan magpatakbo ang mga ibang miyembro ng gobyerno, kung ano lang ang gusto nila, hindi dahil sa kung ano ang tama,"" she said. (You know what is happening here? Retaliation. They are annoyed because of the rallies and the petitions, that's why they did this... It's very disappointing that some government officials act this way, that they do what they want regardless of what is right.) She added that the TWG's capacity to lead the motorcycle taxi pilot run should also be questioned. The TWG will be convening within the week to discuss the committee's push for reconsideration. Poe urged the public to file cases against the TWG if they push through with the termination. As of posting, the TWG said it is considering the sentiments of the Senate panel and the resource persons, and will further discuss them on Wednesday, January 22. A report will then be submitted to Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade. Meanwhile, on Friday, January 24, the TWG will meet with stakeholders, resource persons, and the 3 motorcycle taxi providers to ""iron out the specifics"". – Rappler.com "

Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures If a man who has been cursed to see ghosts and eventually dies violently sees a sliver of goodness, then a film as obtusely dreary as Nicolas Pesce’s The Grudge should have a few silver linings, right? (READ: Rage, fear in 'The Grudge' remake: An interview with 'Queen of Horror' Lin Shaye) Unnecessary American reincarnation There’s this scene in Pesce’s unnecessary American reincarnation of Takashi Shimizu’s Ju-On: The Grudge where a tired husband (Frankie Faison) opens up to his house guest (Jacki Weaver), a woman whose job is to euthanize suffering people, about the curse that has befallen his household. In a surprising moment of levity, the man doesn’t talk negatively of his predicament. He talks about how the curse has given him hope that there is something beyond death, that in some twisted sense, there is still some connection that binds everyone. It’s a brief moment, but it is perhaps the lone spark in a film dulled by its reliance on a repetition of scares. Shimizu’s film isn’t exactly the best that's come out of the Japanese horror craze . It is, however, the ripest for commercial exploitation, given that its main conceit of a curse being passed on by merely stepping inside a house where a violent death has happened allows for an onslaught of sequels and spin-offs. In fact, Pesce’s take has a direct connection with Shimizu’s film, with a woman (Tara Westwood) quickly leaving the same cursed Tokyo house for her home in America, not knowing that she has actually imported the ghost that has her violently massacring her family.  Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Supernatural tragedies Pesce uses the same formula as Shimizu’s film, which assembles various storylines that all lead to some form of supernatural tragedy. The formula of multiple narratives reveals both the silver lining and the trouble with this remake. Let’s start with the silver lining which is the terrific cast. The Grudge is superbly acted. While a horror film would normally not require much from its actors and actresses leading production companies to populate the films with subpar thespians, Pesce has an ensemble to die for. Weaver is a breath of fresh air, adding necessary quirk to the repetitious cycle of mood and brutality. Andrea Riseborough, who plays the film’s main protagonist, shifts from the steely resolve required of a female cop to stark vulnerability with seamless believability. There are definitely moments in the film that reveal that there is more thought than just typical victim mentality that motivate the existence of these characters. Sadly, the same thing happens over and over, despite the shifts in story and timelines. The scares never escalate. They are never grisly enough, never pushing the envelope in terms of gore and shock value. The Grudge, despite its being enveloped with the most artificial of bleakness, is very tame, which is a pity since Pesce’s Piercing (2018) had moments of such visceral intensity that this horror film just sorely needs.

Peasant leader Jennifer Tonag was killed by unidentified men. Photo from Katungod Sinirangan Bisayas-Karapatan MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on Monday, January 20, condemned the ""brutal"" killing of a local peasant leader in Northern Samar. In a statement, the CHR said 35-year-old Jennifer Tonag is just one of the many victims who have ""faced reprisals due to exposing state-perpetrated human rights violations and demanding for justice and accountability."" ""The CHR calls for justice for the death of Tonag and all the human rights defenders in the country and around the world who sacrificed their lives to create a better future for everyone, especially for the marginalized, vulnerable, and disadvantaged segments of our society,"" CHR spokesperson Jacqueline de Guia said. Unidentified men killed Tonag, organizer of the Northern Samar Small Farmers Association (NSSFA), while she was on her way home from a seminar sponsored by the Department of the Interior and Local Government last Friday, January 17. She sustained two gunshot wounds, one on her hand and chest, and was declared dead on arrival at the Northern Samar Provincial Hospital. Tonag leads the NSSFA, a group helping farmers defend their land rights and other issues, in Lope de Vega, Northern Samar. The CHR's regional office has already dispatched a quick response team to conduct an independent probe into Tonag's killing, De Guia said. Call for repeal of EO The CHR ""amplified the clamor"" for the government to repeal Executive Order No. 70 which created a national task force that sought to address causes of armed conflict with communists at the local level. Human rights groups have said that EO No. 70 only led to massive red-tagging as well as threats and harassment under the guise of a counterinsurgency program. ""The commission reiterates its call to the government that it must desist from all forms of violence and harassment against human rights defenders,"" De Guia said. ""These attacks are in the context of increasing number of reported extrajudicial killings in rural areas alongside the intensified counterinsurgency program of the government,"" she added. More than 100 human rights defenders have been killed since July 2016, data from rights group Karapatan showed. Many of the killings were in provinces that have long had conflicts related to land, with victims mostly coming from the farming sector.

A lawmaker wants a House probe into the government's concession agreement with the Light Rail Manila Corporation. File photo from LRMC MANILA, Philippines – An administration-allied lawmaker is calling for a House investigation on the allegedly “lopsided” contract between the government and the Ayala-Pangilinan consortium Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC). Anti-Crime and Terrorism Community Involvement and Support (ACT-CIS) Representative Eric Yap filed House Resolution (HR) No. 647 on Monday, January 20, just 3 days after President Rodrigo Duterte said he would look into the contract of the Light Trail Transit (LRT) as he once again made threats against the Ayala family and business tycoon Manny Pangilinan. Without giving the specific amount, Yap said the LRMC’s gross revenue since 2015 “appears to be bigger than the Project concession fee, which may indicate an unjust and inequitable terms that may put the financial burden of the agreement to the government.” “There must be a review of such existing government contracts with private firms to ensure that these are primarily advantageous to the Filipino people,” added the ACT-CIS congressman. The LRT 1 is jointly operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority and the LRMC, a consortium of 3 infrastructure companies: the Metro Pacific Light Rail Corporation, a subsidiary of the Pangilinan-led Metro Pacific Investments Corporation; AC Infrastructure Holdings Corporation, a subsidiary of the Ayala Corporation, and the Macquarie Infrastructure Holdings. The business tycoons behind LRMC – the Ayalas and Pangilinan – have long been in hot waters with Duterte over the separate water concession agreement between the government and the Ayala-led Manila Water and Pangilinan's Maynilad. The President had been outraged after separate arbitral rulings ordered the Philippine government to pay P7.39 billion to Manila Water and P3.4 billion to Maynilad for the non-implementation of rate hikes Duterte then began making threats against the Ayala family and Pangilinan, prompting both water concessionaires to waive the results of the arbitral rulings and no longer demand payment from the government. The President has since offered the Maynilad and Manila Water new deals crafted on the government's terms, but Duterte also warned he would send the Ayalas and Pangilinan to jail if they refuse the new contracts. – Rappler.com "

It said poor women and girls were at the bottom of the scale, putting in ""12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day,"" estimated to be worth at least $10.8 trillion a year. ""Our broken economies are lining the pockets of billionaires and big business at the expense of ordinary men and women.

""The gap between rich and poor can't be resolved without deliberate inequality-busting policies,"" Behar said ahead of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, where he will represent Oxfam. Oxfam's annual report on global inequality is traditionally released just before the forum opens on Tuesday in the Swiss Alpine resort. It had some astonishing statistics. ""The 22 richest men in the world have more wealth than all the women in Africa,"" it said. If the world's richest one percent paid just 0.5 percent extra tax on their wealth for 10 years, it would equal the investment needed to create 117 million new jobs in elderly and child care, education and health, Oxfam said. Oxfam's figures are based on data from Forbes magazine and Swiss bank Credit Suisse, but they are disputed by some economists. The numbers show that 2,153 billionaires now have more wealth than the 4.6 billion poorest people on the planet. Women and girls are burdened in particular because they are most often care givers that keep ""the wheels of our economies, businesses and societies moving,"" Behar said. They ""often have little time to get an education, earn a decent living or have a say in how our societies are run,"" and ""are therefore trapped at the bottom of the economy,"" he added.

The Philippines' overall growth prospects remain firm, as long as the Taal Volcano situation does not escalate any further. Photo by Lisa Marie David/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – As long as Taal Volcano won't erupt violently, it won't affect much of the Philippines' economic growth, according to the country's chief economist. Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said on Monday, January 20, that areas within the 14-kilometer danger zone generated 0.17% of the gross regional domestic product (GRDP) of Calabarzon. If the radius were to be expanded to 17 kilometers, the GRDP of the area would be 0.26%. ""We don't see it having a major effect unless there is a violent eruption,"" said National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Undersecretary Adoracion Navarro. NEDA's view was echoed by University of Asia and the Pacific economist Victor Abola, who said in a recent press briefing that the impact so far is ""very localized."" First Metro Investment Corporation chairman Francisco Sebastian added that the country's economic structure is backed by domestic consumption and has plenty of other areas for growth. So long as volcanic activity does not escalate any further, Sebastian said overall growth won't be threatened. Foregone income due to the Taal eruption has reached P4.31 billion, according to NEDA's preliminary assessment. Bulk comes from the agriculture and fisheries sector (P3.17 billion), followed by services (P789.1 million) and industry (P357.3 million). (READ: Taal Volcano ash wipes out bee pasture in Laguna) The figures would go up if the danger zone's radius were to be expanded to 17 kilometers. Foregone revenue within the expanded area would reach P6.66 billion, with agriculture and fisheries still contributing to much of the losses at P3.17 billion. The services and industry sectors are estimated to lose some P711.9 million and P2.78 billion, respectively. The area surrounding Taal Volcano has great economic significance to the region. The lake, with an area of approximately 239 square kilometers, provides livelihood through fisheries and tourism. The government is aiming for the country's gross domestic product to grow by 6.5% to 7.5% in 2020. NEDA is now developing the rehabilitation plan for areas affected by the Taal eruption.

The infographic – which also carries the title ""Duterte Legacy"" – contains numbers that tout the achievements of President Rodrigo Duterte's administration as of January 9, 2020. It was shared on social media starting on Friday by Duterte supporters like Mocha Uson, who is currently deputy executive director at the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration. A poster version of the graphic can be seen in video highlights of the campaign launch event uploaded by the PCOO on its Twitter account, as well as on the Duterte Legacy Facebook page. The Philippine News Agency (PNA) also credited the infographic to PCOO in an article on Tuesday, January 21. At the lower part of the infographic were the numbers ""64 airports,"" ""243 seaports,"" ""2,709 bridges,"" and ""9,845 km [kilometers] of roads."" Administration officials have previously claimed that these numbers are completed projects since Duterte took office. However, not all of those airports, seaports, bridges, and roads are newly built. These counts include projects involving the repair, rehabilitation, upgrades, widening, or expansion of existing infrastructure. Airports and seaports In a Manila Bulletin column on November 17, 2019 by ""Build Build Build"" committee chairperson Anna Mae Lamentillo of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the 64 airport projects include the modernization and rehabilitation of Tacloban Airport and the Ormoc Airport, and improvements in some existing domestic airports like those in Camiguin, Virac in Catanduanes, and Tuguegarao City in Cagayan. The new completed airport projects Lamentillo mentioned in her column include the Bohol-Panglao International Airport, the Lal-lo International Airport in Cagayan, the Sangley Airport in Cavite, and a new terminal of the Mactan-Cebu International Airport. Even here, the Lal-lo International Airport isn't exactly newly-created under Duterte. Also known as the Cagayan North International Airport (CNIA), the airport opened for operations in October 2014, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation, which collects market intelligence about the aviation and travel industry worldwide, including profiles of airports and airlines. A March 14, 2018 article in the PCOO's website also noted that, ""Since 2015, the CNIA has been catering to chartered flights regularly."" PCOO reported that the airport got upgrades in 2017 and 2018 including the ""construction of the remaining runway facilities"" so that the CNIA can serve commercial flights. The airport received its first commercial flight in March 2018. In December 2019, Rappler marked as false an earlier claim that the Duterte administration has ""built 200 international and domestic airports."" As for completed seaports, a July 2019 press release by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) indicates that the seaport projects – which numbered 200 at the time – includes the extension, widening, and rehabilitation of existing ports. Lamentillo's November 2019 column also listed rehabilitation projects alongside newly-built ports – like the Cavite Gateway Terminal and a new terminal building at the Cagayan de Oro Port – among the 243 commercial and social/tourism seaport projects completed under Duterte. Bridges and roads Meanwhile, the 2,709 bridges also include rehabilitation and repairs of current bridges, not just new bridges. The DPWH listed the breakdown itself in a November 15, 2019 PNA article. ""Of the 2,709 bridges, 462 were widened, 108 constructed, 1,642 bridges strengthened, and 155 replaced. About 342 local bridges were also built,"" said the report, quoting from a statement by DPWH Secretary Mark Villar. The same goes for the numbers on roads. In the same November 2019 PNA article, Villar said that out of the 9,845 kms of roads, ""a total of 1,121 km was maintained, 2,092.89 km widened and 1,361 km rehabilitated and upgraded."" – Rappler.com "

But she might just seek overseas work again because 10-year-old Princess has a heart disease, and the P350,000 worth of damages may not cover a lifetime of care.  LOSS. Princess Arianne Caniban, 10 years old, lights a candle at the Forest Lake cemetery in General Santos City on November 17, 2019, where most of the Ampatuan massacre victims are buried. Photo by Lian Buan/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – It has been a tough 10 years on widowed Argie Caniban ever since she lost her husband John in the 2009 Ampatuan massacre, and it's not about to get any easier, even with the long-awaited guilty verdict on her husband's killers. Their only daughter Princess Arianne, who is 10 years old or as old as the massacre, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in October of last year. (READ: Children bear the brunt 10 years since Ampatuan massacre) Rheumatic heart disease means there was damage detected to the valve of Princess' heart, and this can either be treated by medication or surgery. Argie has to spend P3,000 ($58) every month for Princess' medicines; 10,000 ($196) for injections every 21 days; and P5,000 ($98) every 5 months for 2D echo procedures on Princess' heart. All this while hoping Princess never needs surgery. Argie has not been able to get a job since John died because Princess needs full-time attention. She remembers the time when John was alive. Princess was a sickly child, and while John's salary from Periodico Ini helped a lot, it wasn't enough. ""Dinaanan namin hirap talaga, palagi lang siya nasa hospital, pumupunta sa pulitiko, nanghihingi ng tulong,"" Argie said of her late husband. (We really struggled, John always spent time at the hospital, he would seek help from politicians.) John, along with 31 other journalists, joined the convoy of then governor aspirant Esmael Toto Mangudadatu on his way to file his certificate of candidacy when they were massacred by the members of the rival clan Ampatuan. Twenty eight (28) people were convicted for the murders in a decision by the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC) on December 19, 2019, or 10 years in the making. 56 were acquitted. The Ampatuans have started appealing their convictions. Only P350,000 in damagaes Judge Jocelyn Solis Reyes awarded each family P350,000 in total damages, plus the equivalent of income lost for the killed victim, which varies per family. While some families will get as much as P23 million for the loss of earning capacity (heirs of Jephone Cadagdagon, journalist), a total of 16 families, including Argie, were not awarded income loss because they did not submit evidence to the court. Argie is at a loss on what to do next, because she said P350,000 will certainly not be enough for what could be a lifetime of medication for Princess. The P350,000 will also not be given immediately. Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Richard Fadullon earlier said the decision needs to be final, meaning it would have to be upheld by the Supreme Court, before families can start claiming damages, a process that can take years. ""Nabalitaan lang namin news update lang na baka after two years,"" Argie said. (We heard from news updates that maybe it would still take two years.) The lawyers for the victims' families are still navigating the appeal period as to the next steps they will take on the aspect of damages. Argie, for one, wants to know if she can still submit evidence of loss of John's earning capacity. It's a question nobody has the answer to yet. Her lawyer Nena Santos was still uncertain when Rappler reached out on Monday, January 20. ""Wala rin po kaming Philhealth,"" Argie said. (We also do not have Philhealth.) ""Minsan po nanghihingi ako sa kapatid ko at sa parents ko, lahat ng gamit ko na-prenda ko na sa pawnshop,"" she added. (Sometimes I ask help from my siblings and parents. I have pawned off all my things.)

In 2012, Argie went to Kuwait because of mounting financial problems. But she had to flee. ""Almost 5 months po ako, inattempt po ako ng amo ko na gahasain, nag-run away po ako sa ganun na sitwasyon,"" Argie said. (I was there almost 5 months but my employer attempted to rape me. I ran away from that situation.) Argie said she might just be forced to leave Princess again and seek a job overseas, but she said she will never go back to Kuwait. ""Kapag hindi siya naka-inom ng maintenance pabalik balik yung pneumonia,"" Argie said, saying she has to order Princess' maintenance medicines ahead because the pharmacies in General Santos City do not have them in stock. (If we fail to give her maintenance medicine, her pneumonia recurs.) ""Kung minsan nagkuha na ako ng passport ko, gusto ko na i-renew, gusto ko bumalik para masuportahan ko yung anak ko, kahit saan po na country,"" said Argie. (Sometimes I will get my passport and I want to renew it, I want to go back overseas to support my daughter, any country will do.) Every time she feels the urge to seek job overseas, she fights it because Princess cannot lose another parent. Argie said her family has received offers before – as much as P50 million – to drop the case, but they never blinked. But Argie is grasping at straws – and the justice she has fought for and waited for so long does not seem like it can offer concrete help anytime soon. – Rappler.com For those who want to help Argie and Princess Caniban, please contact the author at lian.buan@rappler.com or Argie at 09656123426 "

Photo by Adem Altan/AFP TEHRAN, Iran – Iran said Monday, January 20, it will consider withdrawing from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) if a dispute over its atomic program goes before the UN Security Council. Britain, France and Germany launched a process last week charging Iran with failing to observe the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, a move that could eventually see the Security Council reimpose international sanctions on the country. Iran has accused the 3 EU member states of inaction over sanctions the United States reimposed on it after unilaterally withdrawing from the landmark accord in 2018. The European move ""has no legal basis"" and if they take further measures ""Iran's withdrawal from the NPT will be considered,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying by the Iranian parliament's website. The landmark 2015 deal reached with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. Since the US pullout, Iran has progressively rolled back its commitments to the accord in retaliation. It has hit out at the three European nations that remain party to the tattered deal for failing to live up to their promises to ease the impact of US sanctions on its oil-based economy. ""If the Europeans return to the commitments, Iran will also stop reducing its commitments, but if the Europeans continue as they have been... we have different options,"" said Zarif. The foreign minister said Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had warned former EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini about such consequences in three letters sent in 2018. ""It was stated in the president's letter that if this issue is referred to the Security Council, Iran's withdrawal from the NPT will be discussed but before that we can consider other (options),"" he said. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Loic Venance/AFP RENNES, France – FC Nantes announced on Sunday, January 19, that it will pay tribute to its former striker Emiliano Sala at the league match against his first French club, Bordeaux, on January 26. The 28-year-old player was killed on January 21 last year when the small plane taking him to join Cardiff City crashed off the British island of Guernsey. Sala of Argentina had been transferred to the Welsh club, in the Premier League at the time, after three-and-half seasons at Nantes. He had arrived in France as a youngster to join Bordeaux, who loaned him out to Orleans, Niort and Caen. He then moved to Nantes where he was the club's top scorer for 3 straight seasons. ""Emiliano was a talented player, warm and human. We all miss him,"" Nantes said in a statement. In homage to the player who ""dreamed of playing for the Albiceleste,"" Nantes will don a jersey inspired by the colors of the Argentine national shirt. Proceeds from sales will go to the two Argentine clubs where Sala played as a youngster. A canvas featuring Sala will be laid in the center circle as the players warm-up and giant screens will display images of his best moments in yellow. Groups of fans will spread a giant banner in the stands and sing the song with which they celebrated each of Sala's goals, before a minute of applause. There are still unresolved issues surrounding the player's death, such as who was responsible for the crash in which pilot David Ibottson also died, and, above all, the payment of the 17-million-euro ($18.85 million) fee agreed for his transfer. In September, FIFA, the governing body of world football, ordered Cardiff, relegated last summer to the Championship, to pay the first instalment of 6 million euros.

In an interview with Rappler, Jail Chief Inspector Glenn Sianquita said that 49 male persons deprived of liberty (PDL) and 4 women PDLs were brought to the Batangas City Jail at around 2 am Monday, January 13. Lemery is roughly 13 kilometers away from the Taal Volcano. It is one of the 11 towns in Batangas that are on total lockdown. ""'Di naman maitatanggi na nadagdagan 'yung congestion rate.

All of the 49 male PDLs were squeezed into one cell, bringing the total inmates inside the room to 52. Sianquita said that the cell is only for 15 people, but each room in the city jail averages to about 40 people. Sianquita also said that there's a possibility for the transferred inmates to extend their stay in the Batangas City Jail, as the municipal prison in Lemery sustained infrastructure damage due to earthquakes that have occurred since the eruption began.

International tourism growth slows down in 2019. File photo by Naveen Ganglani/Rappler MADRID, Spain – The rise in the number of international tourist arrivals slowed to 4.0 percent in 2019, its slowest rate since 2016 due to a cooling global economy, geopolitical tensions and uncertainty regarding Brexit, the World Tourism Organization said Monday, January 20. The Madrid-based UN body, UNWTO, predicted global tourism will grow by 3.0-4.0% this year, buoyed by major sporting and cultural events such as the Tokyo Olympics in Japan. The number of international tourist arrivals hit 1.5 billion last year, up from 1.4 billion in 2018, the body said in a statement. Tourist numbers grew by 6.0% in 2018, 7.0% in 2017 and by 4.0% in 2016. ""The slowdown in linked to the results of the global economy, with economic growth of around 3.0%,"" UNWTO's market intelligence chief, Sandra Carvao, told a news conference. She said ""strong uncertainty around"" Britain's looming exit from the European Union, simmering geopolitical tensions and the collapse of Thomas Cook, the world's oldest travel form, had also contributed to the slowdown. But Carvao stressed that both 2017 and 2018 had posted exceptionally high rates of tourism growth. ""What is happening is we are returning to historical levels of tourism growth,"" she said. Europe and the Asia-Pacific region were the most affected by the slowdown in tourism arrivals. Arrivals rose by 4.0% in Europe in 2019, down from 6.0% in 2018, while in Asia-Pacific arrivals rose by 5.0% compared to 7.0 percent in 2018 as ongoing protests in Hong Kong weighed the sector down. Africa posted a 4.0% rise in tourist arrivals, down from 9.0% in 2018. The Middle East was the one bright spot as tourist arrivals in the region jumped by 8.0% in 2018, up from 3.0% in the previous year, due mainly to Saudi Arabia's ambitious plan to draw foreign visitors. UNWTO expects France, Spain and the United States to once again be the three most visited countries in the world last year once it has final figures. ""We don't really expect changes in the rankings,"" said Carvao.

Guests attend a modern-day Van Gogh exhibit in Manila. File photo by Rappler AMSTERDAM, Netherlands – Researchers said Monday, January 20, that a brooding self-portrait by Vincent van Gogh is genuine after decades of uncertainty, identifying it as the only work painted by the Dutch master while suffering from psychosis. The Self Portrait (1889) – which shows the artist giving a sideways glance against a swirling blue and yellow background — was confirmed as authentic by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Questions were first raised about whether the painting — owned by the National Gallery in Oslo, Norway — was genuine as far back as 1970 but the Norwegian museum finally decided to end the doubts in 2014, sending it to Dutch experts. Using X-ray analysis of the canvas, studies of the brushwork and references to letters to his brother Theo, experts established it was painted while Van Gogh was in an asylum in Saint-Remy in France in the late summer of 1889. ""The self-portrait that is behind me has been doubted for a very long time,"" Louis van Tilborgh, senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum, told AFP as he showed off the picture. ""It's a work of art that for all kinds of reasons was by him but nevertheless also had certain aspects that were different from other pictures."" ""So we had to find an explanation for that and that was difficult, but I think we've solved that and so we're proud that we've more or less given the work back."" The Oslo museum bought the painting in 1910 from a collector in Paris for 10,000 francs, making it the first Van Gogh self-portrait to enter a public collection, but doubts have swirled about it for some 50 years. It uses less vibrant colours to other works from the same period, including muted blues and sickly yellows, and some of the paintwork looks less finished. But the new findings establish the painting as a companion piece to two famous self-portraits finished weeks later when he emerged from his psychosis, now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. ""Although we were open to all possibilities, of course we are very happy"" that the painting is genuine, said Mai Britt Guleng, curator of old masters and modern art at the Oslo museum. – Rappler.com "

Novak Djokovic kicks off his title-retention bid in the Australian Open with a gutsy win. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Novak Djokovic survived a scare to join Roger Federer and Serena Williams in the Australian Open second round as heavy downpours caused chaos, forcing organizers to postpone a swathe of matches. Defending champion Djokovic was made to sweat before beating Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff in 4 sets on Monday, January 20, when fears over air pollution were replaced by disruption caused by rain. While play continued at the 3 stadiums with retractable roofs, half of the 64 scheduled matches were postponed, ensuring a big backlog for Tuesday. Wet conditions are unusual for the Australian Open, which is more used to extreme heat and was plagued by smog from bushfires during qualifying, when players suffered coughing fits and breathing problems. Air quality was rated ""good"" as the first round started on Monday, but about 4 hours later, play was suspended on outside courts when the heavens opened in Melbourne. World No. 3 Federer was briefly hauled off court while the roof was closed on Rod Laver Arena before returning to complete a routine 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over American Steve Johnson. Williams, on the hunt for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title, won the opening set against Anastasia Potapova in just 19 minutes as she cruised to a 6-0, 6-3 win in less than an hour. ""I feel like I can still improve and get better throughout this tournament, for sure. This is a good stepping stone for right now,"" Williams said. However, Williams' elder sister Venus was ousted in stunning fashion by 15-year-old Coco Gauff, who won 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in a repeat of her first-round upset at Wimbledon last year. In the late match, defending champion Djokovic dropped his first set since 2006 in the opening round before recovering to beat Jan-Lennard Struff, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 2-6, 6-1. ""There is a lot of pressure and a lot of different emotions involved. I definitely try to remind myself to stay present and really enjoy,"" said the seven-time Melbourne winner, who brought up his 900th Tour-level victory. Former US Open champion Sloane Stephens was the biggest women's casualty on Day 1 when she crashed out in 3 sets to Zhang Shuai of China – her fourth first-round exit in Melbourne. Shapovalov racket row Defending champion Naomi Osaka was done well before the downpour as she dismissed Marie Bouzkova of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-4, in 80 minutes, smashing one powerful serve that broke a net fastening. ""It was really tough for me trying to control my nerves,"" said Osaka. ""It's tough to play someone you've never played before in the first round of a Grand Slam."" Later on the covered center court, Australian world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty recovered strongly from a set down to beat Lesia Tsurenko, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1. In the men's draw, Greek 6th seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who beat Federer en route to the semis last year, crushed Salvatore Caruso, 6-0, 6-2, 6-3. Player anger over smog dominated the final days before the tournament, which is taking place after bushfires ravaged large parts of Australia, destroying thousands of homes and killing 29 people. Tournament officials are closely monitoring pollution and will halt play and close the 3 main stadiums' roofs if particulate matter suspended in the air hits PM2.5 200. In other results, Canadian 13th seed Denis Shapovalov argued furiously with the umpire over a code violation for throwing his racket as he lost in 4 sets to Marton Fucsovics. Croatian 25th seed Borna Coric was another first-round loser as he went down to experienced American Sam Querrey, while Australia's Sam Stosur bombed out against Caty McNally. But former champion Caroline Wozniacki, playing her last tournament before retiring, safely reached the second round as she beat Kristie Ahn, 6-1, 6-3. – Rappler.com "
100,249801,"January 22, 2020",Music,"On the streets of Manila, Martin Riggs lost his wallet and found his voice",Amanda T. Lago,"Talk about making something great out of a bad situation  MARTIN RIGGS. The busker has come a long way from playing for no one on the streets of Manila. Rappler screenshot MANILA, Philippines – When Martin Riggs first started busking, he didn't even know what busking was. All he knew was that his wallet was no longer in his pocket, and he still needed to make his way home. Martin got off the bus on the way home from Adamson University, when he noticed that his wallet had been pickpocketed – but he still had to get home. The only thing he had left was his guitar. What else was there to do then, but take it out, and play for his fare? ""Tumugtog ako somewhere sa St. Dominic, malapit sa Bacoor, Cavite...nung ginawa ko siya parang, may maling nangyari sakin, pero tama yung ginagawa ko,"" he said. (I was playing somewhere in St. Dominic, near Bacoor, Cavite...when I did it, it was like something wrong happened to me, but I was doing something right.) ""Siguro yun ang testament na pag may nawawala sa'yo, may mas magandang papalit (maybe that's a testament that if you lose something, something better comes along)."" At first, no one paid attention to him – until he entered a nearby bar and asked if he could play one song before the band went on. They let him, a foreigner tipped him P100, and that was enough – he went home. It was only after that that he learned what busking was through indie artist Ace Antonio. He saw Ace playing in Bonifacio Global City (BGC), which regularly invites musicians to play in designated corners along their shopping areas – like busking lite. Martin then went to the mall closer to his home, Alabang Town Center (ATC), and asked if he could do the same thing Ace did. Like the people at that bar he first played in, they let him. ""Ang ganda (it was great),"" Martin said of his first mall busking experience. But he felt something was missing. Real streets ""I wanted to try the real streets, yung parang madumi, magulo, yung parang masasaksak ka, yung parang mayroong vibe na rally, may vibe na aktibista (something dirty, messy, like a place where you can get stabbed, something with the vibe of a rally, with an activist feel),"" he described. This led him to a place that fits closer to the description of what he was looking for: in the Lawton area, near Manila City Hall – your textbook loud, busy, chaotic corner of the Metro. ""That's what changed my life."" Not that there's anything wrong with busking in malls, he was quick to add. ""It's just that parang mas hapit yung kaluluwa ko sa kaluluwa ng kalsada. Lalo na yung maduming kalsada (I feel like my soul is more attuned to the streets)...it matches the, I don't know, dirtiness of my soul."" Today, Martin still plays on dirty streets – but whether he gets home or not no longer depends on the kindness of strangers. After a video of him busking went viral, he got a fateful phone call from no less than Callalily frontman Kean Cipriano – who just happened to be one of Martin's idols. When he picked up and heard who was on the other end, Martin wanted to throw his phone away in disbelief. Kean, who was then just starting his label O/C Records, invited Martin to work with him, and now, Martin is the A&R and one of the talents of O/C. He's also played in places that are definitely not a smelly intersection in the middle of the metro. These are venues and gigs that many aspring musicians are still only dreaming of: the likes of 19 East and Coke Studio, the latter being his first big gig, where he opened for Ben&Ben and cried out of joy while playing on stage. When Martin does play on the streets these days, people no longer pass him by – they crowd around him, stay, and listen. One time, someone in the audience even came up to him crying, saying his music was just what they needed to get through that day. And it isn't just passersby that join him, too – the likes of Keiko Necesario, Unique, and BennyBunnyBand have all jammed with him at his favorite spot at the 7-Eleven on P.Noval street in Sampaloc, the site of what has now become one of his projects: Street Gigs ni Martin Riggs. In person, Martin projects a confidence that might come off as a swagger – but it's probably an effect of playing on the streets for years. You simply can't second-guess yourself when you're trying to get your voice to be heard amidst rushing vehicles, street hustlers, harried commuters, and even some potentially dangerous people . ""Parang mas mukha po kasing ako yung mananaksak kaysa sa kanila eh (I think I look more threatening than they do),"" he joked. But really, Martin said that doesn't actually know if he's safe when he's busking, ""especially in a country where we're being deprived of freedom."" Manila's streets aren't exactly the dog-eat-dog, untamed urban jungle that it's often made out to be – not all of them anyway. Some parts are actually safe, with the only real danger being security guards hell-bent on shooing pretty much everyone away who isn't a just passing through. But for someone as outspoken as Martin, even a safe spot could be dangerous. He, after all, writes and sings about pretty much everything – even testy topics that people tend not to bring up in everyday conversation. Of love and hypocrites During his Live Jam show on January 16, he opened slow with ""Rendezvous,"" a song about self-discovery and figuring out one's path. In ""Tayuman,"" a quiet, delicate love song about missed connections and what ifs, Martin took full advantage of the Tagalog language's oddness as he demonstrated how only a handful of syllables can have completely different meanings with small changes in phrasing and stress.  It's the kind of love song that flies well with Filipino listeners: sad, but, because of the wordplay, a little funny too – the song version of the kind of meme-worthy hugot monologue delivered by the heartbroken lead in a romcom. From that quiet love song, Martin went full on rage with ""Damaso,"" a scathing diatribe against hypocrites – particularly hypocrites in power. With lyrics like ""Tayo'y tunay bang malaya kung ang dagat natin inangkin ng iba? Diyos umiiyak sa langit, si kamatayan tumatawa sa Malacañang,"" clearly Martin isn't afraid to get political – which may not be the safest thing to do in public spaces in times like this.  But for Martin, it's no matter: ""If I'm going to die, I'm going to die doing what I want: exercising my freedom in the streets."" Of course, that's not to say that he doesn't appreciate playing in venues off the streets. For Martin, playing on stages allows him to perform with so many talented musicians. ""Yung joy na kasama ko yung team, yung mga kabanda ko...every time na kasama ko sila tumugtog sa stage tapos yung mga hindi ko nadidinig kapag ako lang magisa, nadidinig ko, parang di rin ako makapaniwala eh. Ang gagaling ng mga to eh...tapos kasama ko sila tumutugtog ngayon...sila yung mga idol ko nung nagsisimula palang ako."" (The joy I get when I'm with the team, with my bandmates...every time I play with them on stage, and I hear the sounds I don't hear when I'm on my own, I almost can't believe it. These guys are so good, and I play with them now. They were my idols when I was just starting out.) Martin is set to play on another big stage, Hiwaga, on February 10. It's quite an occasion too: the first-ever Monday show of the long-held tradition that is the University of the Philippines (UP) Fair. He also teased new releases in 2020 – but, true to his spontaneous, freewheeling nature, was loathe to reveal exact dates. Not just passing by No matter how big his career gets though – and at the rate he's going, it is getting bigger and bigger – Martin feels most at home on the streets where he began. Ultimately, his mission is to make busking so normal in the Philippines that security guards will no longer chase street musicians away. It seems like a tall order for a metropolis where public spaces don't seem to belong to the public, but Martin remains hopeful. He's so intent on this mission that he's even started a group, the Busking Community PH, a collective of musicians who collaborate and support each other as they take their music to the streets. The group started when a documentary on Martin's life came out, and he got an influx of questions on busking and performing on the streets. ""Naisip ko since parang naging community na talaga siya ng mga busker, why not start it out? The Busking Community PH? A community of street performers na simbolo ng kalayaan sa bansa natin, kahit mumunti."" (I thought since the buskers have formed a community already anyway, why not start it out? The Busking Community PH? A community of street performers that are even just a small symbol of freedom in our country.) In Metro Manila, the streets are, most of the time, the last place anyone wants to be. It's the place parents constantly try to get their kids out of. A typical Manila road is is crowded and smells of vehicle exhaust. The sidewalks are mostly cracked or non-existent. Personal space is a myth. Sometimes, safety is too. Those who are just passing by, who just want to make it home may not like the idea of these artists taking up precious space on already crowded streets. But the way Martin puts it, it's already a chaotic world out there – a bit of music can't possibly make things worse. ""Laging busy ang kalsada ng Maynila, ang kalsada ng Pilipinas laging busy. Ang goal lang naman namin is bilang busker mapa-stop, look, and listen, hoping to make you happy, yun lang naman yung goal, mapasaya lang yung taong nangangailangan ng kanta o ng awit sa saglit ng buhay nila."" (Manila's streets are always busy, Philippine streets are always busy. Our only goal as buskers is to have people stop, look, and listen, hoping to make you happy. That's our only goal, to bring happiness to people who need Anyone who is out on the street is usually just there because they're trying to get from one point to another. But as far as Martin is concerned, he's there to stay, and keep playing for as long as he can. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Jire Carreon/Rappler MANILA, Philippines –  A few weeks after the clock strikes midnight and the calendar year moves up a notch, it's the Chinese part of the world's turn to celebrate the beginning of a new year. In 2020, the Chinese New Year happens on January 25, ushering in the Year of the Rat. There are many stories about how the Chinese New Year started. One of them is the legend of the monster Nian, who had a long head and sharp horns and would scare villagers. An old wise man then taught the villagers how to fight back against Nian back by wearing red, making loud noises, and bringing out fire. You can watch the story below: The celebration lasts for 15 days in China, but other countries – particularly those with big Chinese communities – have their own traditions and customs.

The festivities won't be complete without firecrackers. File photo by Rob Reyes/Rappler 3. Skip the wash. In Chinese culture, people are discouraged from cutting their hair or even washing it on the first day of the year. It's because the Chinese word for hair is similar to the word that means ""to become wealthy."" You certainly wouldn't want to jinx that. 4. Special food. Food, of course, is a key component. In China, people usually feast on egg rolls, noodles, dumplings, and shrimp. In Vietnam, the celebration known as Têt sees families sharing sticky rice cakes with beans and meat and sticky red rice made with fruit. In Korea, they serve soup with rice cakes that look like little coins. 5.  Tidying up. In the days leading up to the New Year, houses undergo massive cleaning to declutter from the previous year. Cleaning on the first day of the New Year is not allowed because it is said to sweep away good luck or good fortune. 6. New Year markets. Days before the New Year in China, some open-air markets open up, selling a wide range of items, from plants, toys, and clothes, as part of the celebration. – Alexa Villano/Rappler.com "

A man leaves the Wuhan Medical Treatment Center, where a man who died from a respiratory illness was confined, in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, on January 12, 2020. File photo by Noel Celis/AFP BEIJING, China (3rd UPDATE) – A World Health Organization emergency panel will meet this week to discuss a SARS-like virus that has spread beyond China and that a Beijing government expert said Monday, January 20 is contagious between humans. The new coronavirus strain, first discovered in the central city of Wuhan, has caused alarm because of its connection to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. The total number of people diagnosed with the new virus has risen to 218. Beijing and Shanghai confirmed their first cases on Monday while more than a dozen others emerged in southern Guangdong province, and 136 new ones were found over the weekend in Wuhan, according to state broadcaster CCTV. An 89-year-old man has become the fourth person to die from the virus in China, authorities said Tuesday. Scientists have scrambled to determine the mode of transmission, with a seafood market in Wuhan believed to be the center of the outbreak. But Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at the National Health Commission who helped expose the scale of the SARS outbreak, said patients could contract the new virus without having visited the city. ""Currently, it can be said it is affirmative that there is the phenomenon of human-to-human transmission,"" he said in an interview with CCTV. In Guangdong, two patients were infected by family members who visited Wuhan, Zhong explained. Fourteen medical personnel helping with coronavirus patients have also been infected, he said. Zhong predicted an increase of viral pneumonia cases during the Lunar New Year holiday – the world's biggest annual travel rush – but expressed confidence in curbing the spread of the virus, China's official Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday. The World Health Organization panel will meet in Geneva on Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak ""a public health emergency of international concern"" – a rare designation only used for the gravest epidemics. WHO said earlier that an animal source seemed to be ""the most likely primary source,"" with ""some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts."" Wuhan has 11 million inhabitants and serves as a major transport hub, including during the annual Lunar New Year holiday, which begins later this week and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel across the country to visit family. Over the next week, 2,131 flights will depart Wuhan for other Chinese cities, according to the flightradar24 website. Another 205 are headed for overseas destinations, the most frequent of which is Thailand, which will receive 54 flights in the January 20-27 period, the website said. Weighing in on the matter for the first time, President Xi Jinping said Monday that safeguarding people's lives should be given ""top priority"" and that the spread of the epidemic ""should be resolutely contained,"" according to CCTV. Xi said it was necessary to ""release information on the epidemic in a timely manner and deepen international cooperation,"" and ensure people have a ""stable and peaceful Spring Festival,"" the broadcaster said. Five cases were reported in Beijing, while in Shanghai, a 56-year-old woman who had come from Wuhan was hospitalised and in stable condition, local health authorities said. South Korea on Monday also reported its first case – a 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan. Thailand and Japan have previously confirmed a total of three cases -- all of whom had visited the Chinese city. The virus did not slow down the annual holiday travel rush, though some travellers wore masks at crowded railway stations in Beijing and Shanghai. ""Watching the news, I do feel a little worried. But I haven't taken precautionary measures beyond wearing regular masks,"" said Li Yang, a 28-year-old account manager who was heading home to the northern region of Inner Mongolia for the Lunar New Year. Detection measures Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper published Friday that the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be closer to 1,700, much higher than the official figure. Wuhan authorities said they have installed infrared thermometers at airports and railway and coach stations across the city. Passengers with fever were being registered, given masks and taken to medical institutions. State TV footage showed medical staff working inside an isolation ward at a Wuhan hospital in hazmat suits. In Hong Kong, health officials said they were expanding enhanced checks on arrivals to include anyone coming in from Hubei province, not just its capital Wuhan. Passengers are also being screened at some airports in Thailand and the United States. In Wuhan, 170 people are still being treated in hospital, including nine in critical condition, the city's health commission said. – Rappler.com "

He added: ""Not another penny of UK taxpayers money will be directly invested in digging up coal or burning it for electricity. ""Instead, we're going to focus on supporting the transition to lower and zero carbon alternatives."" Environmental campaign group Greenpeace UK welcomed the announcement, although it said Britain could do more. ""It's great that in the middle of a climate emergency the UK government is finally putting a stop to taxpayers' money being used to support coal plants and mines abroad,"" executive director John Sauven said. ""But if Britain wants to lead by example, it should also urgently phase out support for oil and gas developments, which are pushing the world closer to climate chaos.""

Increase 'risk appetite' The government's export agency reports providing £2 billion ($2.6 billion) in financing for British company exports to Africa in the past two years. The agency says it now wants to ""increase its risk appetite"" in Egypt and the emerging economies in Nigeria and Rwanda. The government said Monday's summit will see British and African firms announce commercial deals worth £6.5 billion, although it was not clear whether these were all concrete commitments. Britain will leave the EU on January 31, although ties will remain the same for 11 months while the two sides thrash out a new trading relationship. London wants to leave the bloc's single market and customs union to allow it to strike trade deals with other countries, even if this brings new barriers to EU trade. – Rappler.com "
107,249809,"January 21, 2020",US & Canada,"Trump brief assails impeachment, demands immediate acquittal",Agence France-Presse,"(UPDATED) One source working with the president's legal team says impeachment process was 'illegitimate from the start,' adding, 'The president did nothing wrong'  IMPEACHMENT HEARING. In this file photo, US President Donald Trump holds a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC, June 12, 2019. File photo by Saul Loeb/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – (UPDATED) President Donald Trump's lawyers submitted a trial brief Monday, January 20 calling his impeachment by the House ""a dangerous perversion"" of the US constitution and demanding his immediate acquittal by the Senate. Almost simultaneously, House impeachment managers responded to an earlier Trump filing, saying the president had engaged in ""corrupt conduct... to cheat in the next election"" and that the Senate should remove him from office ""following a fair trial."" The dueling briefs provided the most extensive look yet at the arguments taken by the opposing sides, as they seek to win over not just senators but the US public. The historic impeachment trial is set to open in earnest at 1 pm (1800 GMT) Tuesday. Senators will hear arguments for 6 hours a day, 6 days a week in a somber exercise presided over by the chief justice of the United States, John Roberts. The two briefs came on what normally would be a quiet federal holiday, Martin Luther King Jr. Day. But the weeks to come will be anything but normal, as the Senate opens only the third presidential impeachment trial in US history. 'A rigged process' In the president's brief, his 12-man legal team contested the very idea of his impeachment. They called the two articles of impeachment – approved largely on party lines in the Democratic-controlled House – the product of ""a rigged process"" and ""constitutionally deficient on their face"" because they involved no violation of established law. The brief said the theories underpinning them ""would do lasting damage to the separation of powers under the Constitution."" One source working with the president's legal team told AFP the impeachment process was ""illegitimate from the start,"" adding, ""The president did nothing wrong."" The 171-page brief maintained that the impeachment articles are ""the product of an unprecedented and unconstitutional process that denied the president every basic right."" ""All of this is a dangerous perversion of the Constitution that the Senate should swiftly and roundly condemn,"" the brief said. 'Unprecedented' cover-up The brief from the House managers, all Democrats, accused Trump of using ""presidential powers to pressure a vulnerable foreign partner to interfere in our elections for his own benefit."" It added, ""In doing so, he jeopardized our national security and our democratic self-governance."" ""He then used his presidential powers to orchestrate a cover-up unprecedented in the history of our republic."" The two articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power by pressuring Ukraine to provide dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, and of obstructing Congress by refusing to allow top aides to testify. The Trump team asserted that the president had both valid reasons and the constitutional authority to demand that Ukraine crack down on corruption, as he insists he did in a phone call with that country's president. To the assertion by Trump's lawyers that the Senate could not remove him even if all charges in the articles are proved, the House briefers replied, ""That is a chilling assertion. It is also dead wrong."" Witness question remains Trump  turned to Twitter on Saturday to blast the process, saying, ""What a disgrace this Impeachment Scam is for our great Country!"" He will be abroad as his trial opens; Trump was leaving late Monday for the economic forum in Davos, Switzerland. Key issues surrounding the trial – foremost, whether witnesses can be called and new evidence submitted along with the extensive record compiled during weeks-long House hearings – remain to be determined. Trump has called on the Senate, where his Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats, to quickly dismiss the charges. The question of additional witnesses is contentious. Democrats say they need to hear from key officials – including former national security advisor John Bolton – with close knowledge of the president's dealings. Trump blocked their testimony during the House hearings. Many Republicans say House Democrats had their opportunity and must now be content with the record to date. The question is expected to be decided by a vote of senators, probably after both sides' advocates have laid out their full cases. It would take only 4 Republicans to join all Democrats to approve the calling of witnesses. But to remove Trump from office would require the votes of 67 senators, seen as a near-impossibility. Even if the trial moves quickly, Republicans fear it might overlap with Trump's State of the Union address on February 4. – Rappler.com "

Camiguin Governor Jurdin Jesus Romualdo in a file photo taken in June 2019. CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – The Regional Trial Court Branch 28 in Mambajao, Camiguin, on January 17, lifted the writ of preliminary injunction (WPI)  issued in favor of the Bahay Bakasyunan sa Camiguin (BBC), a hotel that was ordered closed by Camiguin Governor Jurdin Jesus ""JJ"" Romualdo. In his ruling, RTC Judge Designate Bonifacio Macabaya ruled that the WPI issued in this case will cause irreparable injury to the environment and will pose a threat to the health and well-being of the people who live and work near the BBC's open dumpsite. ""By issuing the writ of prohibitory injunction, the Court granted BBC license to commit continuing and repeated violations of the Revised Ecological Solid Waste Management Ordinance of the municipality of Mambajao, the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 9003), and the Sanitation Code Presidental Decree No. 856,"" Macabaya said. Romualdo had ordered the hotel's closure in May 2019, when he was still mayor of Camiguin's capital Mambajao, where the hotel is located. But the hotel was able to secure a temporary restraining order (TRO) and then a writ of preliminary injunction against the closure. Romualdo said BBC was shut down for violating environmental laws. BBC owner Marie Suzette Chan Good, meanwhile, in her petition alleged that Romualdo acted without or in excess of his jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction. But Macabaya, in his ruling, said Romualdo has the power to issue such order. (READ: Camiguin governor, wife face complaints over hotel closure) ""Closure order is a valid exercise of a power to issue licenses and permits and suspend and revoke the same for any violation of the conditions upon which said licenses and permits had been issued, pursuant to law and ordinance, granted to the municipal mayor under Section 444 of the Local Govermment Code,"" Macabaya said in his ruling. Due process Good also alleged that the ""closure order was swiftly issued by the respondent Mayor Romualdo contrary to the Municipal Health Office's recommendation of suspension of permits only."" She said the order was issued ""whimsically, capriciously, arbitrarily and in wanton violation of the constitutional right to due process"" as she was not given the opportuniy to rebut the Municipal Health Office's findings. But Macabaya said the BBC was not denied due process as it was duly served with a notice of violation. The BBC responded in writing to the said notice, admitting to at least some of the violations observed by sanitation inspectors. ""The essence of due process is simply to be heard, or as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one's side, or an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of,"" Macabaya said, citing Ledesma vs Court of Appeals. Macabaya also said that Romualdo did not act with grave abuse of discretion when he issued the closure order. ""The respondent (Romualdo) issued the closure order on the basis of the findings of sanitation inspectors from the Municipal Health Office of Mambajao that BBC was in violation of the Revised Ecological Waste Management Ordinance of the Municipality of Mambajao, Republic Act No. 9003, and the Sanitation Code of the Philippines. The respondent's act of issuing the closure order cannot be considered capricious, whirmsical, arbitrary or despotic,"" Macabaya said. The judge added: ""The Court finds that the respondent (Romualdo) acted within the scope of his authority granted by law as the municipal mayor of Mambajao when he issued the closure order; that the issuance of the closure order by the respondent (Romualdo) was not áttended by grave abuse of discretion; and that the BBC was not denied due process."" Macabaya said Romualdo may suspend or revoke licenses and permits ""when the conditions upon which said licenses or pemits had been issued, pursuant to law or ordinance, had been violated."" Romualdo, who is now governor of Camiguin, said that since the revocation of the license of BBC in May 8, 2019, and the subsequent TRO and WPI filed by Good, the BBC has been operating continuously albeit without license as there was a WPI. ""We waited for the court to issue its verdict, we allowed BBC to operate continuously because they have a WPI,"" Romualdo said. Romualdo said that since the WPI has been lifted and all allegations issued against him by Good have been proven false, the closure of BBC will move forward. In a previous interview, Romualdo said that they will reinstate the BBC's license ""if they will follow the law."" – Rappler.com "

(Photo by Iran Press/AFP) KIEV, Ukraine – Ukraine's president on Monday, January 20 urged Tehran to hand over the black box flight recorders of a passenger plane mistakenly shot down by Iranian forces during a spike in tensions with Washington. President Volodymyr Zelensky met Iran's Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mohammad Eslami in Kiev after Tehran suggested it would keep the black boxes. Zelensky told the minister ""Ukraine has the technical capacity and experienced specialists"" to read the information on the Boeing flight recorders, the presidency said in a statement. Iranian ""representatives"" would shortly travel to Ukraine ""to acquaint themselves with those technical capacities. ""The parties agreed that all debris from the aircraft... must be returned to Ukraine,"" the statement said, adding that the issue of compensation for families of the dead had been raised. Zelensky noted that Tehran had ""fully cooperated"" and kept ""most"" of the promises made after the crash. Ukraine Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko had earlier said the minister had come to Kiev to ""officially apologize"" after Iran admitted that it mistakenly shot down the Ukrainian jet. ""We hope that we would be able... to discuss practical issues including the return of the black boxes,"" Prystaiko said.

The Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran on January 8, killing all 176 people on board, mostly Iranian and Canadian citizens. The disaster happened shortly after Iran launched missiles at US forces in Iraq in response to the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad on January 3. Tehran admitted several days later it had accidentally shot down the plane. On Friday, Prystaiko said Tehran was ""ready"" to hand over the flight recorders, but a senior official later announced that Iran intended to keep the black boxes ""for now"". Canada on Sunday repeated its request that Iran quickly hand over the black boxes to France or Ukraine.

Hong Kong's reputation as a global business hub was dealt a fresh blow Monday after Moody's downgraded a key rating. AFP file photo HONG KONG, China – Hong Kong's reputation as a global business hub was dealt a fresh blow Monday, January 20 after Moody's downgraded a key rating, blaming a lack of government response to months of popular protests and China's increased influence over the city's institutions. The rating downgrade is a major blow to Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam, who has struggled to end more than 7 months of huge and often violent pro-democracy protests. It also reflects growing concern within the business community that the institutional features that give Hong Kong more political and economic autonomy are weakening under pressure from the authoritarian mainland. (READ: Human Rights Watch chief says he was barred from entering Hong Kong) In a statement explaining its decision to downgrade the long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings one notch to Aa3, Moody's delivered a blunt assessment of the government's response to the protests. ""The absence of tangible plans to address either the political or economic and social concerns of the Hong Kong population that have come to the fore in the past nine months may reflect weaker inherent institutional capacity than Moody's had previously assessed,"" the New York-based credit rating agency said. It described the government's response to demands for greater political freedoms – and sky-high living costs – as ""notably slow, tentative and inconclusive."" ""It may also point to more significant constraints on the autonomy of Hong Kong's institutions than previously thought,"" the agency added, in a nod to pressure from Beijing. Months of political unrest has upended Hong Kong's reputation for stability while the protests present the most severe challenge to Beijing's rule since the former British colony's 1997 handover to China. Recession Millions of pro-democracy supporters have taken to Hong Kong's streets with clashes between hardcore protesters and police frequently breaking out. Combined with the fallout of the US-China trade war, the protests have slammed the tourist and retail sectors and helped tip Hong Kong into a recession. The protests were initially sparked by a proposed law allowing extraditions to the authoritarian mainland where the opaque judicial system answers to the Communist Party. Opponents saw it as the latest move by Beijing to chip away at the city's unique freedoms, such as its independent judicial system. But as Beijing and Lam dug in, the movement morphed into a broader campaign calling for democratic reforms and police accountability. The extradition law was eventually abandoned, but Beijing has refused further concessions and thrown its full support behind Lam. Among the key demands of the movement are an inquiry into the police, an amnesty for the thousands arrested and fully free elections. Moody's decision comes four months after Fitch downgraded the city's sovereign rating, citing ongoing protests and uncertainty caused by closer integration with the Chinese mainland. It was the first time the agency had downgraded Hong Kong since 1995 when fears about the city's future following its handover to China were at their peak. Moody's changed Hong Kong's outlook from stable to negative in September after Fitch's move but did not follow suit on a ratings downgrade. It the statement announcing Monday's downgrade, Moody's moved Hong Kong's outlook back to stable, noting the city's large fiscal reserves, minimal debt burden and ample foreign exchange reserves. But it warned ""closer institutional integration between Hong Kong and China"" could contribute to further downgrades in the future. – Rappler.com "

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev meet with members of the government in Moscow on January 15, 2020. (Photo by Alexey Nikolsky/Sputnik/AFP) MOSCOW, Russia – President Vladimir Putin moved quickly on Monday, January 20 to push through an overhaul of Russia's political system that has fuelled speculation over his ambitions after his term expires. Less than a week after announcing the reforms that unleashed a political storm in Russia, Putin submitted the package of constitutional amendments to lawmakers. The bill proposes changes that transfer some powers from the president to parliament and the State Council. But according to the amendments submitted to parliament, the president also receives additional powers. The overhaul would also transform the State Council from an advisory body to an institution – potentially headed by Putin – that would shape domestic and foreign policy as well as social and economic development, according to the amendments. It will be formed by the president. Putin, who first became president 20 years ago, announced the proposed changes in a state of the nation address last Wednesday, prompting the government of his loyal lieutenant Dmitry Medvedev to resign. The reforms include giving parliament the power to name the prime minister and limit the president to only two terms in total, instead of two successive terms. Critics have accused Putin, 67, of orchestrating a ""constitutional coup"" and seeking to fast-track changes to the country's political system without going through proper procedures including a referendum. The State Duma's legislative committee is to discuss the package on Tuesday, and the lower house will decide Wednesday when to debate the amendments, speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said. Volodin billed the amendments as a ""historic"" decision by Putin – whose fourth term in the Kremlin expires in 2024 – to share some of his powers with political parties and civil society. 'Unprecedented speed' Senior lawmaker Pavel Krasheninnikov said the second reading of the bill was expected in February. The draft was presented just days after a group of experts and popular figures was set up to develop the proposals and before a public vote on the amendments that Putin promised last week. ""No one expected such a rush with regard to the amendments,"" said the Bell, an independent news website. ""The changes to the Russian state system are taking place with unprecedented speed. 'Stakes are high' As part of the shake-up among top officials, Putin also on Monday removed the powerful Prosecutor General Yury Chaika – who took office in 2006 – and nominated a replacement. ""Things have started moving very quickly. The stakes are very high,"" political analyst and former Kremlin spin doctor Gleb Pavlovsky told AFP. Top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny accused Putin of wanting to remain ""leader for life"" and said the opposition would come out with a counter-plan in the coming weeks. ""No one knows what the heck Putin is going to pull off to remain in power forever,"" Navalny said on Monday. ""I am absolutely sure that Putin, too, does not fully understand what he is doing."" Navalny's ally Ilya Yashin said he and other opposition leaders wanted to stage a major rally against Putin's plans on February 29. ""It will probably be the most important opposition rally in recent years,"" he said on Facebook. Navalny has emerged as the leader of the Russian opposition, mustering huge protests in 2011-12 after Putin announced he would return to the presidency following 4 years as prime minister. Those protests were put down but tens of thousands of people again took to the streets of Moscow last summer to protest the exclusion of opposition candidates from local elections. Those rallies also led to wide-scale arrests and long jail terms for a number of demonstrators. In the elections for Moscow parliament last September, the ruling party lost almost a third of its seats after Navalny instructed his supporters to vote strategically – a tactic he could employ again next year when Russia is due to hold parliamentary elections. – Rappler.com "

The World Health Organization (WHO) study argued that minor or non-essential operations on regular smokers could be delayed to give them time to quit and thereby improve outcomes such as wound healing and heart function. The WHO study, conducted in cooperation with the University of Newcastle, Australia and the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA), found that every additional tobacco-free week beyond the four weeks improved health outcomes by 19%.

In this file photo taken on September 4, 2018, the logo of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is seen at the IMF headquarters in Washington, DC. (Photo by Jim Watson/AFP) DAVOS, Switzerland – Easing US-China trade tensions have lessened uncertainty and the world economy may have hit bottom but a sharp slowdown in India is creating a drag worldwide, the International Monetary Fund said Monday, January 20. However, while the risks to the global economy have grown smaller, the Washington-based global lending institution cautioned that outcomes ""depend to an important extent on avoiding further escalation"" between Washington and Beijing. In the latest update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF cut the global growth estimate for 2020 to 3.3%, 0.1% lower than in the prior report released in October. It lowered the 2021 forecast by 0.2%, to 3.4%. The sharp drop for India ""accounts for the lion's share of the downward revisions,"" the IMF said. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva pointed to India's struggles with declining consumption and investments, budget deficits and delays in making structural reforms. ""After a synchronized slowdown in 2019, we expect a moderate pick-up in global growth this year and next,"" Georgieva told a news conference on the eve of the 50th World Economic Forum in Davos, the annual gathering of business and political elites. ""We are already seeing some tentative signs of stabilization but we have not reached a turning point yet,"" she cautioned. The IMF said the relationship between China and the United States, the world's dominant economic powers, is still troubled by ""unresolved disputes."" ""The risk of protracted subpar global growth remains tangible despite tentative signs of stabilizing momentum,"" the fund warned in its quarterly report. ""Policy missteps at this stage would further enfeeble an already weak global economy."" The charity Oxfam, in an annual report released Monday, warned of growing social inequality and the pressures that is generating. It said the world's 2,153 billionaires now have more money than the planet's 4.6 billion poorest people. ""The gap between rich and poor can't be resolved without deliberate inequality-busting policies,"" Oxfam's India head Amitabh Behar said. US-China trade deal US President Donald Trump signed a deal with China last week that eases the escalating trade tensions but leaves in place tariffs on two-thirds of the goods imported from the Asian economic power. The trade truce led to an upgrade of China's growth forecast to 6.0% in 2020, with a slight slowdown to 5.8% projected for next year. But the giant Asian economy has been on a steadily slowing path for some time. Meanwhile, the IMF trimmed US growth just a tenth to 2.0% this year, and to 1.7% in 2021. Since 2018, Washington and Beijing have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in two-way trade. ""Trade truce is not the same as trade peace,"" Georgieva said on Friday. In its previous analysis, the IMF estimated that trade conflicts and tariffs cut 0.8 percentage points off of global growth. But two-thirds of that damage was due not to the tariffs but to trade uncertainty created by the conflict, which causes companies to put the brakes on investment. If tensions flare again, or if Trump's trade dispute with the European Union or confrontation with Iran should worsen, that too could undermine the ""nascent bottoming out of global manufacturing and trade, leading global growth to fall short"" of forecasts, the report said. Slowing growth in India Receding risks of a hard Brexit have helped stabilize the outlook for Britain and the European Union. And healthy private consumption has helped the still-slow but upgraded growth prospects in Japan. However, the IMF once again slashed expected GDP growth in India, by 1.2 percentage points this year and 0.9 point in 2021 compared to the October forecasts. While growth remains relatively robust at 5.8% and 6.5% for the two years, respectively, it is not enough to continue to reduce poverty in the growing South Asian economy. India has for years been a major engine of global expansion along with China, while advanced economies have bumped along at far slower rates. But it had already been downgraded in October due to a bigger-than-expected decline in domestic demand amid growing stress in the financial sector. Meanwhile, Latin America continues to slow, even as Brazil has stabilized and growth there was upgraded. Mexico was downgraded, while Chile suffered ""a sizable markdown"" amid widespread social unrest. – Rappler.com "

Reporters Pia Ranada, Mara Cepeda, Camille Elemia, Ralf Rivas and correspondents Bobby Lagsa and Raymon Dullana file a petition before the Supreme Court on April 11, 2019, asking it end Duterte's coverage ban on Rappler. Photo by LeAnne Jazul/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – In what could  be another crossroad for Filipino journalists, Rappler is asking the Supreme Court to rule that President Rodrigo Duterte – or the executive branch for that matter – has no power over the news media. In asking the High Court to lift the nearly 2-year coverage ban against Rappler for events of President Duterte wherever he is here and abroad, the online news organization asked justices to clarify: Can the President pick who's legitimate media and who's not? Can he restrict access to public events? ""The question posed by petitioners affects intersecting fundamental rights under the Constitution. Thus, the Honorable Court is duty-bound to demarcate clearer borderlines between the press and the executive branch,"" Rappler said in its response filed on Monday, January 20, to the Office of the President's comment on the original petition. Rappler insisted that a fundamental right of the free press is self-regulation. ""It is only the free press, not the executive branch, that has the power to say whether or not petitioners are legitimate journalists or not,"" said Rappler. The petition was filed against the Office of the President, Office of the Executive Secretary, Presidential Communications Operations Office, Media Accreditation and Relations Office and Presidential Security Group. The right to self-regulate The restoration of democracy after the 1986 EDSA People Power revolution and the passing of a new Constitution guaranteed a free press. It is the 1987 Constitution that guided the Supreme Court in deciding landmark press freedom cases. During the Arroyo presidency, for example, the Tribunal declared as unconstitutional the 2006 raid on the Tribune newspaper offices – an act that the Arroyo administration then defended as part of its mandate to prevent lawlessness under Presidential Proclamation No. 1017 (David vs Arroyo). In 2008, the Supreme Court also ruled as unconstitutional the press release of the National Telecommunications Commission warning against the publication of the ""Hello, Garci"" tapes that contained conversations between then-president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and an elections commissioner over her votes in the 2004 presidential race. (Chavez vs Gonzales). In Rappler's press freedom case pending with the Supreme Court, the organization asserted: ""Only the press can determine who the press are. It is not a press ID that makes one a journalist... An outright ban against members of the press from covering newsworthy public events involving the presence and participation of the Chief Executive is an infringement of the right of a free press."" Malacañang said the ban did not violate the press' right to self-regulate because it is not an issue of press freedom. ""This case has nothing to do with self-regulation and freedom of the press. Candidly, it is a case between respondents and petitioner Rappler alone as a corporation whose IPC accreditation and SEC registration have been revoked,"" said the Office of the Solicitor General on Malacañang's behalf. Rappler's license has not been revoked. In July 2018, the Court of Appeals remanded the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) revocation order to the commission for reinvestigation. (READ: What you should know about the Court of Appeals decision on Rappler) IPC accreditation Malacañang initally provided varying reasons for the coverage ban, before Duterte himself said he was banning Rappler for being ""liars"" and ""fake news."" Later, in a pleading to the Supreme Court, Malacañang said Rappler was banned because its accreditation by the International Press Center (IPC) was not renewed, following the SEC's shutdown order on Rappler. The IPC is under the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO) that typically processes accreditations for foreign journalists coming to the Philippines. It's also the office that prints IDs for the Malacañang Press Corps (MPC). Malacañang said that IPC accreditation is needed ""for special access"" to presidential events. It cited Executive Orders No. 4 (2010) and 297 (1987), which were mainly orders on the reorganization of the press secretary's office in Malacañang. ""Nothing in E.O. No. 297 provides legal basis for the conclusion being proffered by respondents, that is, that members of the press can be denied access to newsworthy events involving the Chief Executive held in venues open to the public if they are not properly accredited,"" said Rappler. Rappler said that using the ""accreditation"" argument is just a ""pretextual justification"" for the ban, and that the real reason is because Duterte merely said so. ""As the ban was directed by the highest administrative officer of the executive branch, respondents, who are his subordinate officers, cannot be expected to disobey, much more countermand, the directive of the Chief Executive,"" said Rappler. Clear and present danger? Rappler raised the principles of strict scrutiny and clear and present danger. Strict scrutiny and clear and present danger are tests to assess if there is a compelling reason for the government to restrict free speech, such as a grave threat to national security. While Malacañang insisted that the ban did not restrict free speech, it also did not factor in the said principles. But Rappler went head and explained that its journalists do not classify as clear and present dangers. ""The day that Democracy dies is the day when Government is permitted to consider dissent as a 'clear and present danger',"" Rappler said. Journalists as intervenors The Supreme Court has allowed other journalists from various media organizations, who are not affected by the ban, to join the case as intervenors.

A woman walks along the beach on Hormuz Island in the Gulf Strait of Hormuz, off the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas, on April 29, 2019. (Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP) PARIS, France – The French foreign ministry said Monday, January 20 that 8 European Union nations had given their ""political support"" for a new naval patrol to help avoid potential conflicts in the Strait of Hormuz, the strategically critical entry to the Gulf. Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal backed the new force, whose mission headquarters will be based in Abu Dhabi. A Dutch frigate is expected to launch the patrol rotations by the end of February, a French army official told AFP on condition of anonymity. The move comes amid escalating tensions in the region, especially between Iran and the United States, that have sparked attacks on tankers and other conflicts in a crucial zone for oil shipping. Iran is also backing Huthi rebels in Yemen who are locked in a years-long battle with a coalition force led by Saudi Arabia, which has led to ship seizures by Huthi fighters. ""For months this situation has jeopardised freedom of navigation and the security of both European and foreign ships and crews,"" the ministry said in a statement. The Hormuz strait is considered especially vulnerable since it is only 50 kilometers (31 miles) wide and relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of 60 meters (200 feet). The EU initiative also underscores the bloc's goal of acting separately from the US, which launched its own operation alongside allies last November to protect shipping in Gulf waters. France and its European allies are hoping to distance themselves from US President Donald Trump in order to save the landmark 2015 deal curtailing Tehran's nuclear program. Trump abandoned the accord in 2018 and imposed economic sanctions against Iran, rekindling a smouldering conflict that led to strikes on cargo ships as well as Saudi Arabian oil facilities. France, Denmark, Greece, and the Netherlands have already confirmed they will contribute to the patrols, which will be based in the United Arab Emirates, and ""new commitments"" are expected in the coming days, the ministry said. – Rappler.com "

With economic damage and uninsured losses, climate risks could generate a ""green swan,"" they warned – a reference to the concept of an unpredictable and devastating ""black swan"" event developed by philosopher Nassim Nicholas Taleb. ""The increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events could trigger non-linear and irreversible financial losses,"" Francois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of France's central bank, said in the report. The report said that central banks, which aim to preserve financial system stability, can help by developing the analytical tools to measure climate risks or by investing some of their monetary reserves in ""green bonds."" Green bonds finance projects with environmental criteria and are the most common vehicles for green finance. But there is ""no silver bullet"", said Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva, deputy general manager of the BIS, which is often referred to as the central bank of central banks. The authors of the report said banks on their own could not reduce the financial risks, calling on governments, the private sector and civil society to coordinate efforts. The BIS in September created a new fund to make it easier for central banks to invest in green bonds. But current shaky global market conditions mean the take-up of green bonds has been relatively low even though the yields can be just as high as regular bonds. – Rappler.com "

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend a Wheelchair Tennis match during the Invictus Games 2017 at Nathan Philips Square on September 25, 2017 in Toronto, Canada (Photo by Chris Jackson/AFP) LONDON, United Kingdom – Following their newly-forged agreement with Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry and Meghan hope their departure from the royal family will give them ""financial independence."" The couple are giving up their taxpayer-funded income, maintaining some other revenue streams, while leaving several questions about their finances unanswered. What is their income? Harry and Meghan earned a small share of the Sovereign Grant, paid annually to Queen Elizabeth II to cover her and family members' official duties, as well as the upkeep of royal palaces. The grant amounted to £82 million ($107 million, 96 million euros) for the 2018-2019 financial year. It is not known how much is paid to each family member, but it is said to represent only 5% of the couple's income. The remainder is allocated to them by Harry's father Prince Charles via the Duchy of Cornwall, a 53,000 hectare estate and financial portfolio granted to the heir to the throne. It comprised assets of nearly £1 billion in 2018-2019, making a profit of over £20 million. The Times newspaper reported that around £5 million per year is paid out to Charles' two sons, Harry and William. What are Harry and Meghan giving up? The couple will ""no longer receive public funds for royal duties,"" according to a Buckingham Palace statement on Saturday, January 18. It said they had also shared their wish to ""repay Sovereign Grant expenditure for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, which will remain their UK family home."" The recent renovation cost British taxpayers £2.4 million. But it remains unclear if Harry will continue to be so heavily subsidized by Prince Charles and the Duchy of Cornwall. The Daily Telegraph reported Sunday that the Prince will continue to offer ""private financial support"" to his son and his wife. But it said that was expected to come from his own private investment income rather than revenue generated by the duchy, and that this was not ""an inexhaustible source of funds,"" according to a royal source. What resources do they have? Harry and Meghan will be free to earn their own money after giving up their royal titles and allowances. This should present little problem to the photogenic and globally recognizable couple. They have also retained their titles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, which the pair could seek to build a brand around. Meanwhile, Harry sits on an inheritance of tens of millions of pounds, from the death of his mother Diana and also left to him by his great-grandmother, according to the British press. For her part, Meghan Markle previously earned hundreds of thousands of dollars when she was an actress, starring in the US TV series Suits, and running her blog The Tig. Who will pay for their security? Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on the details of security arrangements in its weekend statement, adding there were ""well established independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security."" Harry and Meghan's VIP status entitles them to armed close protection by the British police, and any change to that would ultimately be sanctioned by Britain's interior ministry. The subject has already become sensitive in Canada, where the couple plan to spend a large chunk of their time. In a survey by the Angus Reid Institute, almost three-quarters of Canadians said they did not want their country to bear the costs of their protection. – Rappler.com "

A medical staff member walks outside the Jinyintan hospital, where patients infected by a mysterious SARS-like virus are being treated, in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on January 18, 2020. Photo by AFP BEIJING, China (UPDATED) – Asian countries on Tuesday, January 21, ramped up measures to block the spread of a new virus as the death toll in China rose to six and the number of cases jumped to almost 300, raising concerns in the middle of a major holiday travel rush. Nations across the Asia-Pacific region stepped up checks of passengers at airports to detect the SARS-like coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Fears of a bigger outbreak rose after a prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed late Monday that the virus can be passed between people. (READ: WHO to hold emergency meeting as SARS-like virus spreads in Asia) Authorities previously said there was no obvious evidence of person-to-person transmission and animals were suspected to be the source, as a seafood market where live animals were sold in Wuhan was identified as the centre of the outbreak. But the World Health Organization (WHO), which was concluding a fact-finding mission in Wuhan, was still being cautious, saying at a briefing in Geneva that ""not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted"". Spokesman Tarik Jasarevic warned though that ""more cases should be expected"" both in China and in other countries. Hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing China this week in packed buses, trains and planes to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives. Almost 80 new cases have been confirmed, bringing the total number of people hit by the virus in China to 291, with the vast majority in Hubei, the province where Wuhan lies, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). Other cases have also been confirmed in Beijing and Shanghai plus Guangdong, Zhejiang and Henan provinces. Meanwhile Wang Guangfa, one of the doctors on the NHC team investigating the epidemic, told Hong Kong TV station iCable News that he was receiving treatment after becoming infected. The first case on the self-ruled island of Taiwan was also confirmed Tuesday, with a woman taken to a hospital on arrival at the airport from Wuhan. Wuhan mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV Tuesday that the death toll had risen from 4 to 6. China said it would attend a special WHO meeting Wednesday which will determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which was also detected in Thailand, Japan and South Korea among four people who had visited Wuhan. The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Fever checks At four airports in Thailand, authorities introduced mandatory thermal scans of passengers arriving from high-risk areas of China. Anyone exhibiting signs of fever will be quarantined for 24 hours for monitoring. Around 1,300 passengers are expected each day in Thailand from Wuhan over Chinese New Year, which starts on Friday. In Hong Kong, where memories of SARS still haunt the city, authorities said they were on ""extreme high alert"", with passengers from Wuhan required to fill out health declarations and face possible jail time if they do not declare symptoms. Enhanced screening measures have also been set up at airports in Australia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore and the United States. A man showing symptoms of the disease who had travelled to Wuhan has been put in isolation in Australia as health officials await test results, authorities said Tuesday. In China, the government announced it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as SARS, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the disease and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel. In Wuhan, authorities banned tour groups and police were conducting spot checks for live poultry or wild animals in vehicles leaving and entering the city, state media said. Passengers were being screened for fever at the airport, railway stations and bus terminals. Those with fevers would be registered, handed masks and advised to see a doctor. Chinese train and plane authorities said travellers with tickets to Wuhan could get refunds. WHO meeting Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at the National Health Commission, raised the alarm when he said on Monday that patients can contract the virus without having visited Wuhan, though he added that it was milder than SARS. Doctors at the University of Hong Kong released a study on Tuesday estimating that there have been 1,343 cases of the new virus in Wuhan. Scientists at Imperial College in London said last week the number was likely closer to 1,700. The WHO has only called a global public health emergency a handful of times, including during the H1N1 -- or swine flu -- pandemic of 2009 and the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016. China was accused of covering up the SARS outbreak in 2003 but some foreign experts have praised the swift release of information on this new virus. – Rappler.com "

House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez made the announcement on Tuesday, January 21, a day after President Rodrigo Duterte asked Congress to pass a P30-billion supplemental budget to serve as aid to the volcanic eruption victims in Batangas and neighboring provinces. “If need be, the House leadership is even willing to increase the amount of the supplemental budget to as much as P50 billion for the sake of our kababayans there,” Romualdez said. ""We are going to coordinate with the Palace to get the full details of the supplemental budget,” added the the Leyte 1st District congressman.

She added that Phivolcs is also concerned about the welfare of evacuees, some of whom have been in temporary shelters since January 12, when the Taal unrest began. There are at least 38,906 families or 148,514 persons in evacuation centers, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.

We will be the first one to say if it's safe to go back because we have them (evacuees) in mind all the time,"" Bornas said. Fluctuating gas, rising magma In its 8 am bulletin on Tuesday, Phivolcs said ""weak steam emission"" persisted from Taal's main crater in the past 24 hours. This ""generated ash plumes 500 to 600 meters tall and dispersed ash southwest of the main crater."" The sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission, meanwhile, was measured at an average of 344 tons per day, which is relatively low compared to over 4,000 tons in previous measurements. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. Bornas explained that SO2 levels have been fluctuating, so far. ""The fluctuation actually reflects [the] interaction between [the] groundwater and the magma.... This could be one of the reasons, but definitely it means that magma is at the shallow level of the volcano,"" she said. As for volcanic earthquakes, Bornas said the numbers are going down, but ""the eruptible magma...is already in place."" ""The trend of the seismicity is lowering...but the type of earthquake signifies that there is magma intrusion,"" she explained. ""We have ground deformation signifying that the volcano is still inflated and is still inflating,"" she added, referring to another indication that magma is rising. Phivolcs is using two networks to monitor volcanic earthquakes – the Philippine Seismic Network which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former. The Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 718 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12. Of these, 176 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. From 5 am on Monday, January 20, until 5 am on Tuesday – or a 24-hour period – there were 5 volcanic earthquakes plotted at magnitudes 1.6 to 2.5, with no felt event. The Taal Volcano Network, meanwhile, recorded 448 volcanic earthquakes, including 17 low-frequency earthquakes, in the past 24 hours. ""Such intense seismic activity likely signifies continuous magmatic intrusion beneath the Taal edifice, which may lead to further eruptive activity,"" Phivolcs said in its bulletin. Alert level Asked when Alert Level 4 could be lowered to Alert Level 3, Bornas said the typical observation period would be two weeks. During that period, there should be an ""overall trend"" that all parameters – not just some – have gone down. ""Every day, ine-evaluate po natin 'yung mga monitoring data.... As long as may considerable na probability talaga [of a hazardous eruption], hindi namin puwede ibaba,"" Bornas said. (Every day, we evaluate our monitoring data. As long as there's considerable probability [of a hazardous eruption], we can't lower the alert level.) ""We record earthquakes still, nakaka-record pa tayo ng mataas na SO2, the volcano is inflated...so meron pang tumutulak na magma sa taas.... May seeming paghina ng activity, but it doesn't mean that the danger is over,"" she added. (We record earthquakes still, we still record high levels of SO2, the volcano is inflated, so magma continues to rise.

The Independent Commission Of Enquiry (ICOE) released the results of its probe just ahead of a ruling Thursday by the UN's top court on whether to impose urgent measures to stop alleged ongoing genocide in Myanmar.

124,249826,"January 22, 2020",Food,"MSG isn’t actually bad for you, studies say",Steph Arnaldo,"Activists say that calling MSG the culprit behind 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' is both misinformed and 'racist'  MSG MYTH. MSG has been deemed unhealthy and unsafe for humans, but activists and studies are trying to debunk this age-old myth. Photo from Shutterstock MANILA, Philippines – Most of us are familiar with MSG – typically in the form of a granular, multi-purpose seasoning that comes in either packs or shakers; it's salty, savory, and controversial, perceived as ""unhealthy"" or ""unsafe."" Well, is it true? Contrary to popular and apparently ""misinformed belief,"" experts and activists say it isn't. Studies have shown that this food additive is safe for human consumption, and has no direct correlation to symptoms of the so-called ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome."" The ""syndrome,"" of course, is rooted in the belief that MSG-ridden Chinese food is ""processed"" and ""not safe for consumption"" allegedly because of the post-meal dizziness, numbness, and queasiness (we're guilty of this belief too, admit it). Giving MSG a chance According to a CNN report, the misconceptions surrounding MSG began in 1968, when a man complained about ""numbness"" to the New England Journal of Medicine after dining at Chinese restaurants. Mass hysteria revolving around the ""dangers of Chinese food"" followed after that. A 1969 scientific paper published on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) even pinned MSG as the main cause of CSR, saying it produced ""headaches, burning sensations, and chest pain."" This belief wasn't contained in Europe – in the US, it's a hook if food is ""MSG-free."" Some of us here also try to shy away from using MSG-based pellets in our cooking, or dabbing liquid seasoning onto our saucy dishes. ""Ma-hihighblood ako niyan,"" we might hear our elders say – despite the scientific evidence. In a 2018 report, the FDA reported that MSG-added foods are ""generally recognized as safe,"" when consumed at customary levels. For individuals sensitive to MSG, scientists ""have not been able to consistently trigger reactions."" Their headaches and nausea had ""never been confirmed to be caused by MSG"" either. The report quoted a 1990s study the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) did to examine the safety of MSG, which concluded that ""MSG is safe."" The report stated that individuals complaining of ill effects consumed 3 grams or more of MSG, which is excessive. A typical serving of food with added MSG contains less than 0.5 grams of MSG, so going above 3 grams ""is unlikely."" As always, moderation is key. The World Health Organization and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, in a joint study, also ""failed to confirm an involvement of MSG"" in Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, claiming that this syndrome began from ""anectodal"" evidence, instead of scientific truth. They even placed MSG under the ""safest category"" for food additives. A 2019 study by the Food Science and Food Safety journal also stated that any claims connecting MSG to a certain set of ailments were ""unsubstantiated."" MSG has also been deemed ""safe"" for both the lactating mothers and infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee indicated no adverse effects for either. A Harvard University scientific paper entitled Fact or Fiction? The MSG Controversy also supports other studies. ""A vast array of materials are present in all foods, and the range of pharmacological and allergic effects that foods can elicit in individuals with idiosyncratic sensitivities makes causative agents difficult to pinpoint,"" it said. ""Readily recognizable, but poorly understood, acronyms such as MSG and CRS may have served as scapegoats since they were coined in the late ‘60s."" What is MSG? MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid, a commonly occuring non-essential amino acid found in tomatoes, cheese, mushrooms, grapes, and corn, among other natural food items. This amino acid is extracted and then fermented (like how yogurt, wine, and vinegar are made), producing a salt-like powder used to bring out and enhance other flavors of different foods, like meat, poultry, vegetables, soups, snacks, stews, and seafood. Food made with MSG is indeed stronger in flavor; a ""palate-opening"" experience that encourages bite after bite. Why? MSG taps into our special fifth taste bud: the ""umami,"" a rich, savory, ""tongue-tingling"" taste that makes broths, gravies, sauces, and cheese so flavorfully complex. According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),  people have been consuming MSG for centuries. But at what point did its tasty reputation turn sour? Redefining CRS The belief in CRS isn't just built on misinformation – it is also very xenophobic, according to the Ajinomoto group, maker of the MSG product AJI-NO-MOTO. ""CRS is a problematic term. Let's set the record straight,"" reads Ajinomoto's website. In an effort to remove the stigma of MSG in Chinese cuisine, the Japan-based seasoning company began an online compaign urging the public to ""redefine Chinese Restaurant Syndrome."" Their move? Asking Merriam-Webster to change the dictionary definition of the additive. This is Merriam Webster's current definition: ""A group of symptoms (such as numbness of the neck, arms, and back with headache, dizziness, and palpitations) that is held to affect susceptible persons eating food and especially Chinese food heavily seasoned with monosodium glutamate."" The movement is supported by chef and restaurateur Eddie Huang, How Do I Look? host Jeannie Mai, and licensed doctor Billy Goldberg, host of the Dr. Billy Show, who has also called MSG ""a misunderstood ingredient."" This is long overdue. @mreddiehuang @jeanniemai and @askdrbilly want to make things right. RT to tell @merriamwebster to #RedefineCRS. Find out more about ‘Chinese Restaurant Syndrome:’ https://t.co/bCrs6y4Eyp pic.twitter.com/GkQbmBHK8W Huang is on a mission to change the American perception of Chinese food, acknowledging that ""Americans do not accept Chinese food unless it’s marketed in a western-friendly way."" “I think that the change in people’s perceptions and their ‘open-mindedness’ towards Chinese food is only happening when it’s packaged and presented to Americans in a way they like,"" he said in a NBC News interview. Eddie, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We’re constantly in the process of updating as usage and attitudes evolve, so we’re grateful when readers can point us toward a definition that needs attention. We will be reviewing the term and revising accordingly. Huang states an observation: When Americans see a high-profile restaurant owned by a white man, they deem it safe. They see an immigrant family serving Chinese food in a smaller, delapidated, outdoor stall, they deem the experience unknown and not within their comfort zone – therefore, unsafe and inferior. ""If they see Anna Wintour there, they see Pete Wells, they're gonna go because it's been co-signed. It's like it's okay to go. And that's always bothered me because I'm a person who will go discover food on my own,"" Huang said. ""Our aim is always to provide accurate information about what words mean, which includes providing information about whether a use is offensive or dated,"" he said about their request to bust the CSR-MSG myth in the US. ""You know what gives me a headache? Racism,"" Mai said in the video. – Rappler.com "

File photo shows designer Demna Gvasalia of fashion house Balenciaga with his award after being named winner of the International Ready-to-Wear Designer award during the British Fashion Awards 2016 in London on December 5, 2016. Gvasalia says he's aiming to bring back Balenciaga's haute couture ranks.  Photo by Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP PARIS, France – Balenciaga said Monday, January 20 that it intends to enter the elite ranks of Paris haute couture – more than half a century after the founder of the storied fashion house staged his last couture show. Despite being called ""the king of couture,"" the Spanish-born designer Cristobal Balenciaga spent years feuding with the French Federation of Haute Couture, whose members decide which houses are allowed to call themselves haute couture under French law. The Basque creator, whom Christian Dior deemed ""the master of us all,"" pointedly held his shows a month after the official couture presentations, before shutting his workshop in 1968. But Balenciaga's current designer Demna Gvasalia told Le Figaro that ""relaunching haute couture is my mission for this house."" ""This is where we came from, and after 50 years we're coming back,"" he said. In July 2020, 52 years after its founder closed the house, Balenciaga will reintroduce its Haute Couture collections. “Haute Couture is the very foundation of this house, so it is my creative and visionary duty to bring couture back to Balenciaga“. Demna Gvasalia pic.twitter.com/d5bmcBWsAa The federation told AFP they could not confirm if Balenciaga was being admitted to the elite body, which currently counts just 16 haute couture practitioners. Haute couture shows are held twice a year, in January and July, separately from the presentations of ready-to-wear collections. Gvasalia, the Georgian-born provocateur, might seem an unlikely choice to spearhead a revival of painstaking and time-consuming craftmanship at the esteemed brand, now owned by French luxury conglomerate Kering. But the founder of the poverty-chic brand Vetements – known for subverting expectations with items such as a $2,000 leather version of Ikea's iconic blue shopping bag – said he was already dedicating one day a week to couture at Balenciaga, which he joined in 2015. His workshop will be at the same address on the Avenue George V where Balenciaga began plying his trade in Paris in 1937. ""Haute couture implies certain constraints but it also allows a unique aesthetic freedom,"" Gvasalia told Le Figaro. ""This project is also my response to the question: 'What is luxury today?'"" he said. ""I know that fashion wants to present itself as inclusive, but not everything can be available to everybody. And that's the way it should be."" His announcement comes just days after French legend Jean Paul Gaultier said he would present his final haute couture show on Wednesday, capping a 50-year career that saw him explode the boundaries of what fashion could be. The flamboyant creator said he would bow out with a ""big party"" before embarking on an as-yet unspecified new project. – Rappler.com  "

Aerial view of deforested area of the Amazon rainforest. PARALAXIS/Shutterstock.com PARIS, France – The world is using up more than 100 billion tons of natural resources per year for the first time ever while global recycling of raw materials has fallen, according to a report released Tuesday, January 21. The share of minerals, fossil fuels, metals, and biomass feeding into the global economy that is reused declined in two years from an already paltry 9.1% to 8.6 today, the Circularity Gap Report 2020 found. ""No country is meeting the basic needs of its citizens while also operating within the physical boundaries of our planet,"" said Marc de Wit, a director at the non-profit Circle Economy and lead author of the report. The resources fuelling the world economy increased more than 8% in just two years from 93 billion tons in 2015 to 100.6 billion in 2017, the last year for which data is available. Since 1970, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown fourfold, and trade has expanded tenfold, a trajectory that – in the absence of widespread recycling – relentlessly pushes up the demand for energy and resources. Global use of materials is projected to balloon to 170-184 billion tons by mid-century, the report said. To improve living standards – especially in low-income countries – while also protecting ecosystems that provide clear water, air, and soil, the world must vastly boost the share of recycled natural resources, the authors said. Wealthy nations, the authors note, consume 10 times more resources per person than in the developing world, and produce far more waste. Rich countries must ""take responsibility for the impact of their imports and exports,"" the report said, noting that much of what they consume comes from less developed nations, while much of their waste is exported. The report also noted that recycling rates are high in poorer countries, as waste can ""provide a valuable source of revenue for informal workers.""

Ben Simmons posts his 4th triple-double of the season. Photo from NBA Twitter LOS ANGELES, USA – Philadelphia's star guard Ben Simmons matched his career high with 34 points and added 12 rebounds and 12 assists in a triple-double that propelled the 76ers to a 117-111 NBA victory over the Brooklyn Nets on Monday, January 20. Simmons, named during the game as the NBA's Eastern Conference player of the week, did it all in a dominant performance for a 76ers team trying to keep their playoff push on track despite the absence of injured big man Joel Embiid. The Aussie star connected on 12-of-14 from the field in his fifth straight game with 20 or more points, achieving his fourth triple-double – posting double figures in three key statistical categories – of the season. For good measure, he added 5 steals and 2 blocked shots. ""Ben was ridiculously dominant tonight,"" 76ers coach Brett Brown said. ""He was just multi-skilled, used all over the place in multiple positions, ball-handler, screen setter, post target. He was incredible."" The Nets, again without injured star Kyrie Irving, had 12 turnovers in the first three quarters then coughed up 10 in the 4th quarter. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 22 points for the Nets, who dropped their fourth straight. Philadelphia trailed by 10 in the third quarter but scored the last eight points of the frame – Simmons reeling off the last six – to trim the deficit to one point entering the final period. Simmons opened the 4th with a steal and a hook shot. He followed up by feeding Matisse Thybulle for a dunk, and the Sixers wouldn't trail again. Philadelphia, holding down sixth place in the Eastern Conference, notched their fourth straight win. Eastern Conference leaders Milwaukee improved their league-leading record to 39-6 with a 111-98 victory over the Chicago Bulls. Reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo posted a triple-double of 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists – and scored his 10,000th career point – as the Bucks notched a seventh straight win. The Bucks were slowed by 23 turnovers – 15 in the first half – but held on to beat the Bulls for a 10th straight time. Khris Middleton made 10 of 13 shots from the floor to score 24 points for the Bucks, who were headed Monday night to Paris where they take on the Charlotte Hornets on Friday, January 24, in the first NBA regular-season game in the French capital. The Miami Heat needed overtime to stay in second place in the East, rallying from an eight-point fourth-quarter deficit to triumph 118-113. The Heat, trailing the Bucks by eight games, remained a game in front of the reigning champion Toronto Raptors, who pushed their winning streak to four games with a 122-117 victory over the Hawks in Atlanta. Houston's Russell Westbrook notched another iconic triple-double moment, but his 32-point, 11-rebound, 12-assist performance for the Rockets wasn't enough in a 112-107 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Westbrook played his first 11 seasons for Oklahoma City, and they were the only team he hadn't recorded a triple-double against. He joined LeBron James as the only players in NBA history to notch a triple-double against every team in the league. But the Thunder, aided by 28 points from Chris Paul and 25 from Danilo Gallinari, erased a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit to grab the win. – Rappler.com "
128,249830,"January 22, 2020",Movies,"'Totoro,' 'Spirited Away' and more: Your guide to all the Studio Ghibli films",Paolo Abad,"A handy guide to the Japanese animation studio’s beloved catalog – from the well-loved icons to the lesser known ones  GET SPIRITED AWAY. Plan your Studio Ghibli marathon accordingly with this guide to the popular icons and the lesser known ones in the canon. Photo from Studio Ghibli via Studio Canal There’s no denying how much Studio Ghibli changed the face of animation. It’s one of the world’s most revered animation companies – home to master artists like Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and their protégés. “It makes films that appeal to a wide demographic by refusing to talk down to children and allowing adults to explore their own feelings in unexpected ways,” wrote Brian Tallerico in a roundup for Vulture. “The kingdom of dreams and madness,” a documentary called the famed and influential animation studio that brought you the likes of beloved Totoro, No Face, and more. With the entire catalog of Studio Ghibli available for streaming on Netflix, you now have the chance to marathon them, watch those you have missed, or just bask in the glory of these masterpieces. Here’s a glimpse at all the Ghibli titles that you can now watch on demand (Check here for the release schedule): My Neighbor Totoro (Tonari no Totoro, 1988)  My Neighbor Totoro is ostensibly the most iconic of the Ghibli films. Heck, its titular character is their mascot, even appearing on their logo and cameos here and there (including Toy Story 3). At the heart of Totoro is a seemingly simple story. Two young girls, Mei and Satsuki, had to move to the countryside to visit their ailing mother. There’s more to this sleepy town though, where they encounter a friendly, cuddly woodland spirit they call Totoro. But here, it’s not about a thick, protracted, or epic plot. Yet Totoro is wondrous, exciting, and heartwarming. In the late film critic Roger Ebert’s words: “It depends on a situation instead of a plot, and suggests that the wonder of life and the resources of imagination supply all the adventure you need.” Even with its little feel-good fairy tale, the film has become so much bigger, becoming a cultural icon. If you’ve seen it, watch it again – you know you want to. If you haven’t, meet Totoro. Like a best friend, Totoro will bring joy no matter the situation. Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi, 2001)  Think: Alice in Wonderland, but distinctly Japanese (drawing from its rich folklore) and undeniably bearing the brush strokes of its legendary director. Not to mention the Best Animated Feature Oscar and the Berlinale’s Golden Bear that the film got. Spirited Away is a strange yet riveting coming-of-age tale of a girl named Chihiro as she finds herself in a bizarre world with a menagerie of spirits and creatures beyond anyone’s imagining. Chihiro’s parents have been turned into pigs, and she has to find a way out of this plane of existence lest they all be trapped there. It’s all arduous work for the heroine, involving having to take on a job at the local bathhouse, which not only can be frightening but also emotionally taxing. In all these, there’s much reason to root for steadfast Chihiro in her adventure in this breathtaking, mystical, yet fully realized world that Miyazaki built. It’s easy to see why Spirited Away has resonated across the world, becoming not only a megahit but a veritable masterpiece of the animated medium. Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no Haka, 1988)  World War II is nearing its end and the Japanese Empire is about to fall as bombs rain down. But on the ground, for siblings Seita and Setsuko, the worst is far from over. Orphaned, they starve and get sick, and the film doesn’t shy away from traumatic images. It’s an extremely gutting watch, but don’t let this dissuade you. In the history of cinema, there have only been a handful of animated films that deal with war. Animated films are often thought to be mere lighthearted affairs, but please don’t be naïve to think this way until you’ve seen this film or its ilk (the choice of animation for depicting war itself is a tricky topic in film theory). Grave of the Fireflies, is as heartrending and bleak as it gets, but it conveys the human toll of war beyond geopolitical struggles and the folly of leaders. It’s not strictly anti-war in name though, “simply because it cannot prevent another war from happening,” director Takahata himself said. The Wind Rises (Kaze Tachinu, 2013)  Jiro Horikoshi dreams of becoming a pilot, but he’s nearsighted. Instead of flying planes, he is spurred to build them instead. He is a real-life figure, having designed the Mitsubishi fighter aircraft that Japan used in World War II. The Wind Rises is Miyazaki’s fantastical take on the Mitsubishi engineer’s life. He said he was inspired to make the film after reading a quote attributed to him: “All I wanted to do was to make something beautiful.” It was supposed to be Miyazaki’s final work, as he publicly announced his retirement around that time. In 2017, he came out of retirement, saying that he has been working on his forthcoming movie How Do You Live? Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (Kaze no Tani no Naushika, 1984) Technically, Nausicaä isn’t a Studio Ghibli film, but it was the foundation upon which the entire powerhouse was built. It’s a post-apocalyptic fable with Miyazaki’s touch – based on his own manga – set in a distant future where a massive war has ravaged the world and left only small pockets of human civilization amid the vast Toxic Jungle. Nausicaä is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, one of these nations that have survived. But a rival country threatens to put a stop to the relative calm with the same technology that devastated their world. Nausicaä is a hint of the preoccupations that would define Miyazaki and company’s later work at Studio Ghibli: the threat of ecological ruin, anti-war sentiment, and more. Laputa: Castle in the Sky (Tenkū no Shiro Rapyuta, 1986)  Sheeta, an orphan girl, has a blue crystal in her possession which is said to unlock the secrets to a castle in the sky called Laputa. She meets Pazu, a young boy who has also heard of the floating fortress of legend. However, other sinister agents have nefarious intentions for the weapons it holds. Castle in the Sky is the first production made under the Studio Ghibli name. It builds on the stunning world-building and whimsy that Miyazaki had shown in Nausicaä – even with a breathtaking steampunk aesthetic. It’s an excellent glimpse at things to come for the studio. Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime, 1997)  Princess Mononoke isn’t exactly light material with a dash of gore and heaping doses of philosophical examination. It asks a question raised time and time again: how can mankind and civilization exist in balance with the old, natural world? After a skirmish with a formidable beast, Ashitaka receives a cursed wound which refuses to heal and also inexplicably grants him superstrength. On a quest for a cure to halt the festering, he encounters San, a feral “Wolf Girl” who helps guard the forest with its god and spirits from man’s encroachment. Novelist Neil Gaiman (American Gods, Sandman, etc.) famously wrote the English version of the screenplay. Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup and Gillian Anderson also voice the characters in the English dub. Kiki’s Delivery Service (Majo no Takkyūbin, 1989)  Kiki is a spry young witch. As part of her training, she moves to a new town where she can use her various skills to good use – but she’s not even that good at potion and spells. So, Kiki uses her broom to start up a delivery service and befriends the townspeople. Kiki’s Delivery Service – one of the studio’s most beloved and iconic works – vibrantly captures the young Kiki’s desire to be more self-reliant – but also expresses her struggles to find footing and purpose in the world. Arrietty (Kari-gurashi no Arietti, 2010)  While Mary Norton’s The Borrowers has been adapted several times (including one 1997 movie that included Tom Felton), Hiromasa Yonebayashi’s directorial debut is a charming, imaginative retelling of the same tale. Arrietty and her family are Borrowers, tiny people living in the houses of humans and “borrow” the “things they won’t miss if they’re gone.” They shouldn’t be seen, but she befriends Shō, a boy who’s spending the summer in the house they live in. When their secret existence is threatened, they must get help from Arrietty’s new friend. Howl’s Moving Castle (Hauru no Ugoku Shiro, 2004)  Sophie, a young hatmaker, is transformed into an old woman by a curse. In order to lift it and return to her normal self, she comes to Howl, the wizard lord of the titular moving castle for help. Instead, she gets embroiled in the conflict between her country and another. While Miyazaki has always exhibited a distaste for warfare and violence, Howl’s Moving Castle was said to be his reflection on the Iraq War going on at the time. Tales from Earthsea (Gedo Senki, 2006)  Tales from Earthsea was directed by Hayao Miyazaki’s own son, Gorō, loosely basing it on Ursula K. LeGuin’s eponymous fantasy series of dragons, wizards, and a world at the brink of collapse. The elder Miyazaki had been working on Howl’s Moving Castle, so his own son took over for this project. Unfortunately – even as it was still eye candy – this was considered a critical flop amid Ghibli’s streak of acclaimed works. LeGuin herself expressed disappointment at how it wasn’t as faithful to the source material, saying, “It is reasonable to expect some fidelity to the characters and general story in a film named for and said to be based on books that have been in print for 40 years.” Ponyo (Gake no Ue no Ponyo, 2008)  Ponyo is Miyazaki’s take on the familiar Little Mermaid story: a sea dweller wishes to be human and live among them. It’s a visual treat – from the colors of the sea and the bursts of magical spells – all drawn and painted by hand. Sōsuke, a young boy, finds a “goldfish” trapped in a jar and rescues it, naming it Ponyo. But the “goldfish” is actually the unruly, adventurous daughter of a sea wizard. She expreses her wish to become human and then transforms into a little girl. But this disturbs the natural order as waves take over the land. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (Kaguya-hime no Monogatari, 2013)  The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is the late Isao Takahata’s mesmerizing swan song, drawing from a folktale and imbuing it with so much emotion, breathing life to its heroine. It’s the fable of a girl found on this earth – but clearly not belonging to it. Found by a woodcutter in a bamboo grove, she slips from their grasp too fast as she grows up at a rapid pace. Unlike most of the films in the Ghibli canon, it has a certain delicateness to it owing to its distinct aesthetic. Just like a moving watercolor painting, it’s easily a standout. Without the hyperreal style that the other Ghibli films have taken, Takahata conveys how things can be fleeting (which the Japanese call mono no aware) with so much heart. Pom Poko (Heisei Tanuki Gassen Ponpoko, 1994)  A comedy that mines Japan’s rich mythology, Pom Poko depicts a tribe of tanuki (raccoon dogs) struggling to keep their homes and resisting urban encroachment. Even if the tanuki are really “good-natured,” they’re a mischievous lot. They even have the ability to conjure illusions, shapeshifting into humans and various objects to sabotage the development of the suburbs outside Tokyo. FernGully be damned, it’s hard to miss the message the director, Takahata, is trying to convey. Only Yesterday (Omoide Poro Poro, 1991) Takahata’s Only Yesterday is a gem considering that a lot of Studio Ghibli’s work draws from fantasy. Imbued with a sense of nostalgia and wistfulness, it follows Taeko Okajima, who has only known Tokyo her entire life. Now in her late twenties, she decides to visit her in-laws in the countryside as a breather from the big city life. On her way there, a flood of memories as a young schoolgirl come rushing in, as Taeko questions who she has become. Porco Rosso (Kurenai no Buta, 1992)  At the center of the movie is Marco Pagot, a former World War I fighter pilot cursed to become a pig. Now living as a bounty hunter, he is famously known as “Porco Rosso,” which translates to “Red Pig” in Italian. Miyazaki’s action-filled caper channels some of the charm of those old film noir, Old Hollywood pictures. It almost feels like one, but with the freedom that comes from using the animated medium and the filmmaker’s masterful touch. Ocean Waves (a.k.a. I Can Hear the Sea / Umi ga Kikoeru, 1993)  Ocean Waves is a young adult drama originally made for television by some of those from the younger generation at Studio Ghibli. The plot is as uncomplicated and realistic as it gets: it’s about a love triangle that forms when a transfer student, Rikako, comes in between two friends, Taku and Yutaka. Whisper of the Heart (Mimi o Sumaseba, 1995)  Yoshifumi Kondō was already being groomed to become successor to the masters at Studio Ghibli – before his untimely death in 1998. Whisper of the Heart was his last feature: a blend of no-frills romantic yearning with some magical excursions. Shizuku dreams to be a writer and Seiji is an aspiring violin-maker who cross paths. As the latter pursues his dream in faraway Italy, Shizuku decides to finally pursue her own, toiling to complete a story inspired by an antique shop’s cat statuette (called “The Baron”) before his return. The Cat Returns (Neko no Ongaeshi, 2002)  The Cat Returns is a relatively short (75 minutes) spinoff of Whisper of the Heart, with the dashing Baron making another appearance in this surreal Alice in Wonderland-esque tale. Haru, a girl with the uncanny ability to talk to cats, saves one from getting run over by a truck. Disenchanted and worn out by life as a schoolgirl in the city, she finally gets a chance from the grateful cat – purportedly a prince – to visit “a place where you can forget all your troubles”: the Kingdom of Cats. From Up on Poppy Hill (Kokuriko-zaka Kara, 2011) It is 1963, Japan is preparing to host the Summer Olympics and everything is gradually picking up – especially from the devastation brought by World War II. “It seems the whole country is eager to get rid of the old and make way for the new. But some of us aren’t so ready to let go of the past,” says Umi, the Ghibli drama’s protagonist, who had just lost her father during the Korean War. She befriends and teams up with a boy in her class as the school clubhouse is threatened to be taken down. However, they learn that they share a disconcerting yet unclear connection. Here, Gorō Miyazaki takes on his own father’s written work, and ends up being more successful with it than his previous Ghibli outing. My Neighbors the Yamadas (Hōhokekyo Tonari no Yamada-kun, 1999) In the sitcom-like My Neighbors the Yamadas, the characters resemble caricature-like doodles (and even the watercolor style of Takahata’s other and final work, Princess Kaguya). It’s because it hews closely to the sparse drawing style of its source comic strip in comedically depicting a modern Japanese family and their mishaps. Although it may touch on subjects that can seem too specifically Japanese, it’s a delightful, zany watch. When Marnie Was There (Omoide no Mānī, 2014) Anna, a withdrawn young girl, was told to spend the summer in a seaside town to recuperate after a debilitating asthma attack. There, she’s drawn to a mysterious abandoned mansion. But one time, it appears that it’s not ramshackle as it had seemed to be and meets an enigmatic blonde girl who introduces herself as Marnie. Is she talking to a ghost? But holding her hands is as real as it gets. Throughout the film, Anna discovers the place’s sad history, and as it comes to its climax: the truth about herself. This would’ve been Ghibli’s final film – made before the studio’s hiatus – until Miyazaki returned from retirement. – Rappler.com   Paolo Abad is a film/television editor and motion graphic designer.

The DOH referred to the case as ""non-specific pancoronavirus,"" which means it could be the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or any of the 4 other existing coronaviruses that can infect humans. There are coronaviruses that can cause very mild symptoms, Duque said. “Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious infections such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Common signs of coronavirus infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties,” he added. Duque held the news briefing  a day after it was reported that the provincial health office of Aklan quarantined 3 Chinese travelers who were detected as having fever upon their arrival at the Kalibo International Airport. The Aklan provincial health office said on Monday, January 20, that throat swabs and blood samples were taken from the 3 who all came on different flights on January 17, 18, and 20.  They were later allowed to proceed to Boracay, their destination, after their fever and breathing difficulty subsided. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) said test results on the samples from the 3 persons in Aklan were expected “within 24 to 48 hours.” Referring tothe Chinese travelers, Duque said, ""The signs and symptoms manifested by the 3 Chinese nationals did not fit the case definition as prescribed by the WHO interim guidelines on the new coronavirus."" He said the 3 ""had no history of travel to Wuhan, and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus case, Severe Acute Respiratory illness case, or sick animals."" The SARS-like viral disease caused by what the World Health Organization (WHO) and the medical community are calling the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was initially reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Chinese health officials said it could be transmitted between humans. Cases have since been reported in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai and the province of Guangdong. South Korea, Japan, and Thailand have also reported cases of the disease, which was found in people who visited Wuhan. So far, a total of 218 people have been diagnosed with the virus. This novel strain is the 7th known type of coronavirus that humans can contract. The 2019 nCoV, according to WHO, is “a never-before-seen strain belonging to a broad family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS.” (READ: What is coronavirus? New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears) SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome is a potentially deadly illness that spread in 2003 and killed over 800 in China and Hong Kong. It started in China and quickly spread in Asia, even reaching Europe and North America. It was transmitted through coughing and sneezing. In the Philippines, SARS claimed two deaths in 2003 – a Filipino nursing assistant visiting from Canada and her father, whom she had infected. SARS may start out like flu. Initial symptoms of the disease are: fever over 38 °C, chills, muscle aches and soreness. After 2 to 7 days, infected people develop dry cough, which affects oxygen intake. SARS can then lead to pneumonia, heart failure, and liver failure, especially if infected people have existing illnesses like diabetes and hepatitis. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier in January ordered the health department’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) to strengthen its surveillance of incoming travelers from China after initial reports of the disease in Wuhan. Duque said the BOQ will be on high alert, especially with travelers manifesting fever or signs of respiratory infection. He also urged the public, especially those who have recently traveled from China, to seek immediate medical consult if they have been experiencing flu-like symptoms. The BOQ will with airlines on Wednesday, January 22, to remind them of measures to observe in light of the virus. The BOQ said it would ensure that airlines have universal protective kits on board and remind them of protocols in handling cases on board and reporting cases to authorities. – Rappler.com "

134,249837,"January 21, 2020",Thought Leaders,[OPINION] National Baptist Day: Laughing instead of mourning,Jayeel S. Cornelio,"On social media, Kristoffer Pasion, a Filipino historian, minces no words: 'As a Baptist, I denounce this and the disgusting hypocrisy of these church leaders who invited Duterte and laughed at his curse-laden speech'    Last week, National Baptist Day was held to celebrate the 120th year of Baptist presence in the country. No less than President Duterte, alongside politicians, was there as the keynote speaker. Although the Philippines is categorically secular, the Constitution sees nothing wrong with religious events where politicians are main guests. Secularism, as qualified by the Supreme Court, embraces benevolent neutrality, a principle that recognizes the role of religion in public life and society. Thus, religious activities are exercised in government offices and public spaces. Depending on their magnitude, holidays may even be declared. Furthermore, Filipinos take for granted the pervasiveness of religion in government events, political rallies, and public schools. I have explored these issues in my previous work on religious freedom and Church-State relations in the Philippines. No doubt that the work of Baptists is to be commended. Their congregations have benefited communities around the country since the early 1900s. Even President Duterte began his speech by recognizing them as partners for peace and progress. But a few things during National Baptist Day were troubling. As members of a democratic, secular, and plural society, we need to call them into question. Anti-Catholicism The first is anti-Catholicism. President Duterte exploited the opportunity to attack the Catholic Church during the event. Not only did he recount the curse he hurled at Pope Francis while campaigning in 2016. He claimed too that “maybe it’s good to bullshit the bishops. It might make you win.” The president also observed that priests and bishops have already turned silent. For him he has won the “war against the Catholic Church.” For the president the trick is a no-brainer: One only has to say “putangina ninyo” (you're sons of whores) and then “panalo ka na” (you win). To attack the Catholic Church in a Baptist gathering seems bizarre, but perhaps not when one digs deeper. Benny Abante, who prayed for the president, was in charge of the event. The House Minority Leader is at the same time a prominent religious leader in Manila. Representative Abante is the senior pastor of Metropolitan Bible Baptist Ekklesia. He is also the president of the Bible Believers League for Morality and Democracy (BIBLEMODE), the main organizer of the National Baptist Day. His record as a religious leader speaks for itself. In 2018, Pastor Benny came to Duterte’s defense after the president was criticized for calling the God of Catholics “stupid.” To defend Duterte, Pastor Benny used the pulpit on a Sunday morning to attack Catholicism: “The President did not learn what the Bible says but he learned catechism…He learned false teachings from false prophets, false priests, and false bishops.” It was a theological sleight of the hand. By turning the attention towards Catholicism, Pastor Benny freed President Duterte of any accountability. The president fed his listeners anti-Catholicism and they laughed and lapped it up. Unholy alliance The other issue is the political and moral baggage of National Baptist Day. Very telling has been the reaction even among pastors. In a Youtube commentary, a preacher questions, for example, how the event became a political show.  Juan Ligas quotes a minister critical of the gathering: “All of Baptist principles were flushed down the drain just for the sake of political leverage. That was the goal of this meeting, nothing more, nothing less!” For him and other pastors, faith conceded to political interest. This, in my view, is a valid criticism. Indeed, how far can Christians really go with allying with a regime known for its excesses? Something must be amiss with President Duterte talking about human dignity in his speech. Something must not be right too with Benny Abante praying for the success of Duterte’s campaign against criminality. Baptists themselves have raised concern over this “unholy alliance.” On social media, Kristoffer Pasion, a Filipino historian, minced no words: “As a Baptist, I denounce this and the disgusting hypocrisy of these church leaders who invited Duterte & LAUGHED at his curse-laden speech.” His post attracted a number of reactions, including this one: “Baptist din po ako. Pupunta po sana ako sa event pero nung makita ko mga guest puro politicians hindi na po ako tumuloy. Napakinggan ko sa radio ang speech ni PRDD at nakakalungkot dahil pinapalakpakan ng ating mga kapatid na Baptist ang pagmumura at pambabastos sa kapwa.” (I'm a Baptist too. I was supposed to go to the event, but when I saw that the guests were all politicians, I decided not to go through with it anymore. I heard Duterte's speech on the radio and was saddened by our Baptist brothers clapping at his cursing and his vulgarity towards others.) This is the irony of the National Baptist Day. A religious event meant to bring believers together turned out to be divisive, not because of doctrine but politics. Dissenting Baptists could see through it all. Their choice not to be there was not only political. It was moral. Faith and demcoracy Religion, in contrast to stereotypes, is capable of self-criticism. This much is true in the case of the negative reaction to National Baptist Day. People of other religious groups may not care about this event. But its controversies demonstrate for all of us an important lesson. Faith has a contribution to deepening democracy. How so? Despite the mistakes they have committed in history, religious traditions around the world have also played a role in advancing human rights, ending slavery, and holding governments accountable. In the Christian tradition, this is the point of doing theology. It is not simply about personal salvation. It asks how else God might be moving in the world today. Ultimately it asks what believers can do to make it a better place. For the philosopher Charles Taylor, faith embraces “the human power of self-transcendence, the capacity to go beyond self-rated desire altogether and follow a higher aspiration.” It is therefore wrong when religious convictions are sacrificed on the altar of political ambitions. When that happens, believers laugh at a time they are supposed to mourn. – Rappler.com Jayeel Cornelio, PhD is a sociologist of religion and the Director of the Development Studies Program at the Ateneo de Manila University.

House committee on constitutional amendments chair Rufus Rodriguez says he would reopen their public hearings on charter change this month. Photo by Mara Cepeda/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The House committee on constitutional amendments is recalling the resolution amending parts of the 1987 Constitution that it discreetly approved last year, now that the executive branch submitted a new list of proposed amendments to lawmakers. House committee on constitutional amendments chairperson Rufus Rodriguez said on Tuesday, January 21, that his panel would have to reopen public hearings on charter change as well.  (READ: What you need to know about Charter Change) “So the committee report that we have approved which you complained to be secretive, to be very, very, [discreet because] it was not [done] in the presence of the media, that will be recalled because there is now a new entry of these proposals,"" Rodriguez said in an ambush interview. ""And we believe these are also good proposals to study before we send these constitutional amendments to the Senate,” he added. He was speaking on the sidelines of a briefing organized by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Federalism and Constitutional Reform led by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to inform lawmakers and their staff about the executive branch’s proposed amendments to the Constitution. Because the IATF is a body composed of 11 member-agencies, Rodriguez said their proposed changes to the Constitution would carry more weight and should be carefully deliberated by his panel. “This is now the DILG and not only that, the Inter-Agency [Task Force on Federalism and] Constitutional Reform is composed of about 11 departments! And this is something that we will always consider, considering that it involves the executive department and this is their proposal,” the Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District congressman said. Last year, Rodriguez’s panel drew flak for approving in a closed-door meeting the still-unnumbered resolution of both houses (RBH) that would lift the restrictions on foreign investments and lengthen the terms of congressmen. (READ: Lawmaker seeks longer term for House members, but shorter term in Senate) Senior Deputy Minority Leader Carlos Zarate of the progressive Bayan Muna party-list group said the move was an attempt to skirt the Constitution, which lists only 3 modes to amend it. These are: Congress convening itself into a Constituent Assembly, (Con-Ass) the people electing a Constitutional Convention, and the People’s Initiative, where Filipinos can directly propose changes in the charter. Rodriguez said he planned to hold the public hearings from January to March. He then hoped the 18th Congress would convene into a Con-Ass by May. The House committee chair, however, is yet to discuss his proposed timeline to Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, who has so far not listed charter change among the priorities of the lower chamber. Amending the Constitution is also not a priority of senators, whom Rodriguez hoped would have an ""open mind"" about his panel's proposals. A shift to federalism – where the country would be divided into autonomous regions – was a campaign promise of President Rodrigo Duterte. But in his 4th State of the Nation Address in July 2019, the President made no mention of charter change. Still, the Duterte government said it would continue pushing for federalism. New provisions vs turncoatism, political dynasties The IATF’s proposed amendments includes the so-called the Mandanas decision of the Supreme Court, which allowed the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) of local government units to be sourced from all national taxes, and not just those collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. It also included strong provisions against turncoatism – when politicians easily switch from one party to another – and political dynasties. Found below are the executive branch’s proposed amendments which are not found in the House resolution: In the previous 17th Congress, the House under then-speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, approved on 3rd reading RBH No. 15 that would have shifted the Philippines to a federal system of government. RBH 15, however, was “dead on arrival” in the Senate. – Rappler.com "
136,249839,"January 21, 2020",UAAP,Evan Nelle wants to 'spread his wings' in move to La Salle,Naveen Ganglani,"Evan Nelle seeks growth in the UAAP as he joins the De La Salle Green Archers in Season 84  NEW CHALLENGES. Evan Nelle transfers from San Beda to De La Salle University. Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler MANILA, Philippines –  Following days of speculation, Evan Nelle confirmed to Rappler on Tuesday, January 21, that he will transfer to De La Salle University and play in the UAAP after spending the first two years of his collegiate career with San Beda University in the NCAA. The 5-foot-10 playmaker will undergo a season of residency before wearing green and white beginning in UAAP Season 84 come 2021. ""I just want to spread my wings, try [out] the UAAP, and win for La Salle,"" said Nelle, who was named to the Mythical 5 of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in 2019, in explaning his transfer. A blue-chip recruit out of San Beda’s high school program, Nelle won an NCAA title in his rookie season with the Red Lions and was instrumental in leading San Beda to a perfect elimination round showing as a sophomore. With averages of 10 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and nearly 7 assists a game, Nelle established himself as a premier point guard in college hoops who is effective on both sides of the floor. Nelle also had a 14-assist outing during a 74-52 victory over Jose Rizal University, and wound up second in the MVP race behind his teammate, Calvin Oftana. Bringing his sweet shooting stroke with him, Nelle will now move to Taft Avenue, where he will participate in his first practice under new La Salle head coach Derrick Pumaren on Tuesday. For Nelle, a former player of De La Salle Zobel, his decision to transfer is also a homecoming. ""I was a Lasallian from Senior Prep to Grade 7, so it was a big factor,"" he said. ""I love the school din. I love La Salle. That never changed."" Rumors have circulated that the close relationship of Nelle’s family to Pumaren factored in his decision to leave the Red Lions, but the incoming third-year student-athlete insisted it wasn’t. Nelle also added that the decision to leave San Beda, a place he also called home, was difficult, and brought him to tears. ""It was so hard. Ang hirap magdecide. Ang hirap iwanan 'yung mahal mo, 'di ba (It was hard to decide. It's hard to leave someone you love, right)? So every night, I had to think about it,"" he said over the phone. “I have built relationships with everyone, from coaches, to players, to ball boys, to people around our team. That was one of my hardest decisions in life talaga (really), to leave people I love.” Contrary to reports, Nelle claimed he did not go ""AWOL"" but rather used time away from practice to carefully weigh his decision. On Tuesday morning, he informed San Beda of his choice to move. Nelle’s arrival comes at a good time for the Green Archers’ program, which lost former NCAA juniors MVP Joel Cagulangan after he opted to transfer from La Salle to University of the Philippines. When he turns eligible, Nelle will be the successor to current La Salle starting point guard Aljun Melecio, who will play his final year of eligibility in UAAP Season 83. According to Nelle, Melecio is like a ""brother"" to him, with both young standouts having a ""really close"" relationship. The duo constantly communicates, and share the same skills coach. Furthermore, Nelle also has a good relationship with Andrei Caracut, DLSU’s team captain who graduated after UAAP Season 82. ""For this residency year, I’m going to work on my skills,"" Nelle promised. ""Papalaki ako ng katawan (I'll bulk up). I’ll be under Coach Derrick naman. I’ll see his system. I’ll observe and watch their games. It’s good preparation. I’ll [also] be under Aljun naman, so he’s going to guide me.” As for dealing with the consequences of his decision, Nelle said he planned not to concentrate too much on the expectations of others, and instead focus on doing what Pumaren and the Green Archers would require of him. ""I just want to win. That’s my only expectation. I want to bring a winning culture to wherever I go, and we’ll be under Manong naman. He’s a really good coach,"" he said. – Rappler.com "

139,249843,"January 22, 2020",Books,A review of Walden Bello’s 'Counterrevolution',Carmel V. Abao,"'I don’t think this kind of book can be written by just any sociologist (or political scientist). Intellectual discipline and clarity of this kind come only with a particular depth of political involvement and experience.'   MANILA, Philippines – Dr. Walden Bello’s latest book Counterrevolution can be compared to a leisurely and fulfilling 9-course degustacion dinner. The book is laid out in exactly the same manner: one small, signature dish after another; one short, exemplary chapter after another. In fact, after reading the book, I couldn’t decide which chapter was my favorite. Much like how one feels after a degustacion dinner: parang masarap lahat, from the appetizer to the dessert. Ganoon ang pakiramdam ko sa libro ni Walden: parang ang galing ng lahat ng chapters. From the introductory chapter to the chapters on Italy, Indonesia, Chile, Thailand, India, Philippines, and the North (US and Europe), to the concluding chapter – the narratives were very clear and thought-provoking. Even Dr. Jojo Abinales’ foreword at the beginning of the book was thought-provoking and inviting. Walden's focus on “Right-Left” configurations across country experiences and throughout recent history gives the book its distinct flavor. A number of books about the Far Right and authoritarian populism have surfaced lately but I don’t think I’ve read a book about the Right quite like this one – with this kind of focus (i.e class-based politics) and this kind of approach (i.e historical and comparative). That the book has been nominated for the 2020 Barrington Moore, Jr, award for Best Book in Comparative and Historical Sociology is not at all suprising. Perhaps the most important chapter in the book – especially for students and observers of global politics – is Chapter 9, the concluding chapter on the “origins, dynamics and consequences of Counterrevolution.” I think this chapter drives home the point that there is a connection between class-based politics and the rise of the Far Right but that some nuancing has to be made between a counterrevolution against an insurgent underclass (as in the cases of Italy, Indonesia, Chile, and Thailand) and a counterrevolution against liberal democratic arrangements (as in the cases of the Philippines, India, and the US and Europe). The concluding chapter is very interesting also because it talks about possible ways forward – on how to counter counterrevolutions. I believe this is the most important question in many readers’ minds:  how do we stop this madness? Walden offers 6 propositions and a sort of concluding statement: “The times, in short, call for a progressive politics that goes beyond calling for a return to the old discredited elite democracy, where equality was purely formal, and mobilizes the citizenry behind a national popular program that has at its centerpiece the achievement of genuine economic and social equality, whether one calls this socialism or post-capitalism.” I agree totally with Walden’s normative propositions. What I think may be lacking is a discussion of realpolitik. Because even as Walden is correct in saying that elite democracy has been discredited, the fact of the matter is, the institutions of this discredited elite democracy are really still the only tools that we have to challenge the fascists and populists: elections, courts, Parliaments, Parliaments of the street, political parties, trade unions, peasant movements, youth movements, feminist movements, civil society organizations, mainstream media, social media. (READ: Constitution making as a revolutionary process) Perhaps the only other tool would be an armed revolution that would bypass all these liberal democratic institutions, but that would mean even more violence – in addition to the already violent environment created by counterrevolutions. Do progressives really want more violence? Can our nations really afford more violence? As for Walden’s take on Duterte and the counterrevolution in the Philippines, here are my comments.   I agree with practically all of his propositions in this chapter, except perhaps for two things. Firstly, on Duterte as a “fascist original.” While Duterte ticks all the boxes of what it means to be a fascist, I honestly don’t believe that there is an originality to his fascism. I agree with Walden that Duterte does not simply seek to reproduce the Marcosian past or preserve the liberal democratic status quo and that his trajectory is an authoritarian future, but I think Walden may have failed to mention that what Duterte may actually want is just a reproduction of his governance of Davao City. (READ: Bello: Philippines in 'brave new world' of politics under Duterte)  I honestly don’t believe that Duterte has a political project or a development project. I do not see any evidence that he has such a project. I think he just wants to make a mark or leave a legacy behind – never mind if that legacy involves killing 27,000 people in 3 years. To say that there is a rationality to Duterte’s fascism other than his quest to carve a distinctive place in history may be an overestimation of Duterte. Secondly,  I need to point out that Walden could have elaborated on Duterte’s misogyny.  Especially since he has a section on Duterte’s carino brutal in his chapter on the Philippines, and in the concluding chapter, he claims that “right wing parties and personalities are strongly misogynistic.” Duterte’s misogyny needs to be described because it could explain a sub-phenomenon within the Duterte phenomenon, i.e that Duterte does not hate all women, he only hates the likes of Leila de Lima and Leni Robredo and Risa Hontiveros, and that is exactly what misogyny is. Only the women who dare break the patriarchal code or challenge the sexist script will be punished. Had Walden elaborated on this, he may also have arrived at the conclusion that gender-based movements and not just class-based movements may be crucial in countering counterrevolutions. I have to say, though, that I really like Walden’s last sentence in his chapter on the Philippines: “Duterte has played geopolitics with skill, recognizing the shift in power in the East Asian region from China to the United States, while also using US-rhetoric to burnish his nationalist credentials. He may also see himself as part of an authoritarian regional alliance that is geared to deliver effective government.” It seems to me that this notion of an “authoritarian regional alliance” is another book waiting to be written. I hope Walden considers writing such a book.  – Rappler.com The author teaches political science at the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU).

The iconic British group are hailed on a coin kicking off a Music Legends series being produced by the official mint. It features Queen Elizabeth on the obverse or ""heads"" side as usual joined by Queen on the reverse. The coin depicts the instruments played by lead singer Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, drummer Roger Taylor and bass guitarist John Deacon.

""Freddie was flamboyant and his camp theatrics are a big part of Queen, but the band are more than just a frontman,"" he said. ""To reflect this sense of balance between them I created a design that featured each of their iconic instruments. ""And by making the instruments the focus, I wanted to convey Queen's skill as musicians as well as their passion for their craft.""

141,249845,"January 22, 2020",IMHO,[OPINION] What would Jesus do: The Christian dilemma in the time of Duterte,Andre Lorenz B. Feria,"'I learned that the religious organization I was part of had endorsed politicians who went against the very teachings of my faith...I was disappointed with how the church was seemingly being used to win the ‘Christian vote’    “Oh, be careful little feet where you go. Oh, be careful little feet where you go. For the Father up above is looking down in love. Oh, be careful little feet where you go.” Some might remember this song from Sunday School. It's a song that taught us how to live right in the eyes of God. It's an effective reminder when we find ourselves in situations where we're made to ask: what would Jesus do? The “Christian vote” I found myself in need of this song when I encountered my first major dilemma in my Christian faith and as a Filipino citizen. During the 2019 elections, I learned that the religious organization I was part of had endorsed politicians who went against the very teachings of my faith. Needless to say, I was disappointed with how the church was seemingly being used to win the ‘Christian vote’ and give these politicians leverage. It did not sit well with me that Christian leaders would endorse candidates who were corrupt, sexist, misogynist, anti-poor, self-serving, whose loyalty is with one person and not with the country, and whose struggle is not with the very people they are supposed to represent. In response, I wrote an essay to remind my fellow Christians of our civic duty to elect deserving candidates. It was clearly one of those moments when we had to ask: what would Jesus do? In my parting statement, I wrote, “If Jesus were walking with us this day, you wouldn’t find him in fancy churches endorsing the corrupt and self-serving. He would be walking down the streets, struggling with the masses, hearing their concerns, and preaching God’s word. Let us pray and vote wisely.” 120 years of existence On January 16, the Baptist Churches of the Philippines celebrated its 120th year anniversary with President Duterte as the keynote speaker. In expected attendance were House Minority Leader Benny Abante (the organizer), SC CJ Peralta, Speaker Allan Cayetano, Senate Pres. Tito Sotto, Manila Isko Mayor Moreno, Sen. Bong Go, Sen. Cynthia Villar, Sen. Dick Gordon, Cong. Eddie Villanueva, Cong. Lani Cayetano, and other supporters of the administration. I had to struggle with the same dilemma as before, unsure if I should attend the said event. As a Christian, no sight is more troubling than a celebration of our faith being tampered by obvious politicking. The event was not spared by Duterte’s infamous way of speaking. In the room full of Christian leaders, ministers, elders, members, and even children, he managed to say ""bullshit"" and ""putangina,"" to which some of the attendees responded in uncomfortable laughter. (READ: [OPINION] National Baptist Day: Laughing instead of mourning) I do not claim to be an expert of the Bible, but Romans 12:1 states, “And be not conformed to this world,” so I do not understand why the church needs to find validation from these politicians. I would like to think that our church leaders have the members’ interest in mind, but what do we make of things when there is already dissent and confusion among people because they choose to please these worldly politicians instead of God? Hypocrisy? How can we claim to represent our church people when we do not experience the struggles they face as everyday Filipinos? Most of them work for more than 8 hours every day and travel long distances just to make ends meet, and yet we support politicians who are for the TRAIN law. Most of the communities that we reach out to are urban-poor yet we support politicians who are for the war on drugs which was proven to be ineffective and unfairly targets the poor. We give great respect to the women who've worked hand-in-hand in fostering the next generation of our church, and yet we support a faux feminist and give a pass to sexist and misogynistic politicians. We teach in Sunday Schools where we nurture children to be God-fearing and Christ-like, and yet we support politicians who are for lowering the age of criminality, stripping kids away from the chance for a better life, when Jesus himself asked that these children be closer to him and not be locked in jail cells. We speak of the fear of God and yet we’re supporting a politician willing to kill for his master. We speak of honesty and yet we’re supporting politicians who are silent when asked about the struggles of the Filipino people. We speak of integrity and yet we’re supporting politicians who don’t have a clear stand on our sovereign rights. And we speak of conviction and yet we’re supporting politicians who blindly follow the directives of a man who cursed the name of God multiple times. We cannot claim solidarity and unity in our religious organization when a consensus has not been met. We cannot just be expected to follow when it’s clear in our reactions and comments that there is confusion and dissent. I hope Christian leaders give respect to their members and explain how the politicians they support are the best representatives of our Christian faith. At the end of the day, our accountability is not to any man but God and God alone. – Rappler.com "

This courtroom sketch by Jane Wolsak and released to AFP by the artist shows Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou attending her extradition hearing in British Columbia Supreme Court in Vancouver, British Columbia on January 20, 2020. Illustration by Jane Wolsak/AFP VANCOUVER, Canada – The Chinese telecommunications executive whose arrest in Vancouver badly strained Canada-China relations went to court on Monday, January 20, to fight extradition to the United States, with her lawyers calling the accusations against her ""fiction."" Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of tech giant Huawei and eldest daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, is wanted by US authorities for alleged fraud. Meng made no comment as she rushed past protesters waving ""Free Meng"" and ""Trump stop bullying us"" placards outside the British Columbia Supreme Court. Inside, she sat quietly, following the proceedings with the help of an interpreter. Her attorneys in opening remarks rejected the fraud charges against Meng as ""a fiction."" ""Sanctions drive this case,"" lead defense lawyer Richard Peck said, as Meng's husband Liu Xiaozong and Chinese consular officials looked on from a packed public gallery. ""Would we be here in the absence of US sanctions? Our response is no,"" he said. In order to secure her freedom, the ""princess of Huawei,"" must convince Judge Heather Holmes that the US charges would not stand up in Canada and are politically motivated. The US alleges Meng lied to HSBC Bank about Huawei's relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran. Meng has denied the allegations. She has been out on bail, living in one of her two Vancouver mansions for the past year. Lawyers for Canada's attorney general on behalf of the US Justice Department have said they will justify extradition by arguing that the US accusations against Meng would be considered a crime in Canada if they had occurred here – a key test known as double criminality. On Monday, her defense team began arguing that her misrepresentations, if they occurred, do not amount to fraud, and that Canada had not matched the US sanctions against Iran. ""The US has cast (Meng's) alleged behavior as a fraud against a bank. This is an artifice,"" Peck told the court. ""This case is founded on allegations of breach of US sanctions, which Canada has repudiated,"" he said, adding that Canada was effectively being asked ""to enforce US sanctions."" He also argued that HSBC would not be prosecuted in Canada for unwittingly breaking the sanctions and so Meng's actions caused no harm under its fraud definition. In court documents, the Crown asserted that Huawei controlled the operations of Skycom in Iran; that its staff used Huawei email accounts and security badges; and its bank accounts were controlled by Huawei. But Meng told HSBC executives in a presentation in 2013 that Huawei no longer owned Skycom and that she had resigned from that company's board. From 2010 to 2014, HSBC and its American subsidiary cleared more than US$100 million worth of transactions related to Skycom through the US. 'Grave political incident' Earlier, China's foreign ministry called Meng's extradition case a ""grave political incident"" and urged Ottawa to release the Huawei executive in order to normalize relations. Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland responded that Ottawa ""honors its extradition treaty commitments"" and will not interfere in the case. In a statement, Huawei said that it trusts Canada's judicial system and believes Meng will be found innocent. Meng's arrest during a stopover of a Hong Kong-to-Mexico flight in December 2018 put the 47-year-old at the center of the US and China's battle over the technology giant's growing global reach. It also stuck Canada in the middle of a trade row between the world's two largest economies, resulting in China restricting agricultural imports from Canada. Days after Meng was taken into custody, China arrested two Canadians on what Canada said were vague and trumped-up charges of ""harming national security."" China's ""arbitrary detentions,"" according to Ottawa, of former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor have been widely interpreted as retribution by Beijing aimed at pressuring Canada to free Meng. The hearing in Vancouver is scheduled to last five days. But if the US accusations are found to also be a crime in Canada, a further phase will follow in June, with the defense arguing that authorities conspired to nab Meng as part of a ""covert criminal investigation."" Stunting Huawei's rise Ren Zhengfei has suggested that the case is part of a US plot to crush Huawei, seeing it as a security risk. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had hoped when he came to power in 2015 to deepen Canada's economic ties with China, asked the US for help. He told broadcaster TVA last month that he urged US President Donald Trump not to finalize a trade deal with China ""that doesn't settle the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians."" Trump went ahead, however, and signed a ""phase one"" trade deal with China last week. Former Canadian leaders have urged Trudeau to simply release Meng in a ""prisoner swap"" for Spavor and Kovrig. But extradition experts consulted by AFP say that would encourage what some called Beijing's ""hostage diplomacy"" tactics. – Rappler.com "

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III slams the lease agreement between Chevron Philippines and National Development Company. File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Finance (DOF) said it uncovered an onerous lease contract between Chevron Philippines (formerly Caltex Philippines) and a subsidiary of state-owned National Development Company (NDC), which allowed the former to rent out a 1.2-million-square-meter (sqm) property in Batangas for a meager 74 centavos per sqm. In a statement on Tuesday, January 21, the DOF said the current fair market rental value in the area should be around P17.90/sqm per month. Batangas Land Company Incorporated, a subsidiary of NDC, rented out land in San Pascual, Batangas, for Chevron to use as an oil import terminal. With just 74 centavos per sqm, Chevron allegedly only shells out P10.66 million a year for rent. The DOF said the rental rate should be more than P20 million a month or P257.76 million annually. ""At P10.66 million per year since 2010, the rent Chevron has been shelling out is only around 4% of the P257.76 million per year that current fair market rental rates in the area would suggest,"" the DOF said. Based on documents submitted to the NDC Board, the DOF said rentals paid by Chevron over the 44-year period covering 1975 to 2019 totaled only P146.51 million or about P3 million a year, in addition to real property taxes paid by Chevron under the lease agreement. According to the DOF, the property's current market value is estimated at about P4.9 billion to P5.3 billion, translating into a rental yield of only about 0.2% of the property's value. ""Based on current standards that the state imposes on similar contracts, to have a rental yield of less than 1% is surely grossly disadvantageous to the government and the Filipino people,"" Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said. The DOF's latest statement comes as the government goes all out in reviewing deals made with the private sector. The Ayala group of companies, particularly Manila Water and Ayala Land, as well as Manny Pangilinan's Maynilad Water Services and other business interests, have recently come under fire due to allegedly onerous provisions in their contracts with the government. – Rappler.com "

The TWG will meet with the 3 providers involved in the pilot run – Angkas, JoyRide, and MoveIt – along with Tugade to discuss how to proceed with the pilot run. According to Gardiola, the abrupt termination was brought about by ""legal impediments"" including the Temporary Restraining Orders (TRO) issued by two courts against the guidelines of the pilot run. In particular, the injunctions were against the limit in the number of  bikers per provider. The 10,000-biker cap in Metro Manila for each provider would force Angkas to slash up to 17,000 from its lineup of bikers. Gardiola said that the TRO made it difficult for the TWG to gather data.

It is a big ask for the 33-year-old, who has only won the title once before at Melbourne Park, against a tearful Federer in 2009, with 4 runner-up finishes to his name. ""For me it is a positive start. What you want is a first round win and in 3 sets is even better,"" said Nadal, who clubbed 38 winners and made only 21 unforced errors. ""This court always brings me lots of positive energy."" Nadal, in a pink sleeveless shirt and matching shoes, was in total charge against the world No. 73, storming to a 5-0 lead in the opening set before Dellien held serve, then against the odds broke, before the Spaniard served out the set. Underdog Dellien was broken in the sixth game of the second set but hit back again to break Nadal for the second time in the match before the top seed again rallied to restore control with some sizzling forehands down the line. A flagging Dellien gave it his best shot but Nadal quickly raced 3-0 up in the third set as his physicality and power shone through and there was no way back. ""He (Dellien) has a tough first five games but he had chances to win games,"" said Nadal, who lost in last year's final to Novak Djokovic. ""He's a fighter, he's a great guy."" Nadal next plays either Argentine Federico Delbonis or Portugal's Joao Sousa. – Rappler.com  "

LeBron James manages to catch Bronny's high school game before the Celtics dealt the Lakers their worst loss of the season. Photo from NBA Twitter LOS ANGELES, USA – Basketball's ""James Gang"" was 0-for-2 on Monday, but Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James was pleased to have a chance to see his son Bronny play in a high school game in Massachusetts, even if he didn't win. James was angered, however, that a fan at the HoopHall Classic in Springfield, Massachusetts, threw a small object – perhaps a piece of food or small bit of trash – at his son during the game. ""I mean it's just disrespectful, and it was a little kid, too,"" James said. ""I don’t know how old that little kid was. I don’t know if he learned that on his own or he learned that at home or whatever the case may be, but it's disrespectful."" James, on the road with the Lakers facing the Boston Celtics on Monday night, took the side trip to Springfield to see Bronny's Sierra Canyon team take on Paul VI Catholic High School of Virginia. ""Truly a blessing,"" James said of the rare opportunity to attend one of his 15-year-old son's games. ""The only bad thing about that was that the James Gang took two 'Ls' today.""

""I walked – and they didn't call it,"" he quipped. He was more serious in addressing the incident involving his son, although he didn't realize quite what had happened until video surfaced on social media. ""I was at the complete opposite end of the floor,"" James said. ""I did see the referee stop the game or stop the in-bounds and a cop came up there. But I didn't know what happened until the video evidence shown to me today when I got here."" James said he wasn't surprised that Bronny remained unfazed as a game official called for security and briefly stopped the contest. ""He's cool, calm. He is better than his mom and dad at some of the things he lets off his shoulder,"" he said of the youngster, a freshman who came off the bench Monday and played 13 minutes.

153,249857,"January 21, 2020",Tech Features,Five things to know in the case of Huawei's Meng,Agence France-Presse,"Key facts on the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Meng Wanzhou, who's currently fighting extradition to the US  HUAWEI. In this file photo taken on August 2, 2019 people walk past a Huawei logo during the Consumer Electronics Expo in Beijing. Photo by Fred Dufour/AFP SHANGHAI, China – Hearings into whether a Huawei executive can be extradited to the United States began on Monday, January 20 in Vancouver, in a case with potential repercussions for ties between the US, China and Canada. Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom giant and daughter of its founder Ren Zhengfei, was detained in the Canadian city on a US warrant in late 2018. Her arrest put the 47-year-old at the center of the US and China's battle over Huawei's growing global reach. Here are five things to know about the situation: Technology giant Founded by former People's Liberation Army (PLA) engineer Ren in 1987, Huawei has grown into one of the world's biggest technology firms. It is now the top producer of telecommunications networking equipment and the number-two supplier of smartphones, behind Samsung and ahead of Apple. Huawei equipment carries much of the planet's data and communications traffic, making it a key player in the coming advent of hyper-fast 5G networks that will enable revolutionary new technologies such as artificial intelligence. Distrust in Washington Ren's military background and privately held Huawei's opaque culture have long fuelled suspicions of close ties to China's one-party security state. This has stoked US fears that Beijing could use the firm as a Trojan horse for espionage or cyber-attacks, accusations that company executives strenuously reject. The Trump administration has essentially barred Huawei from the US market and waged a global campaign to isolate the company. 'Double criminality' Meng, seen as a possible successor to Ren as chief executive, was held on a US warrant for allegedly lying to banks about violating Iran sanctions and put under house arrest. She denies the allegations. In hearings opening Monday, her lawyers will maintain that she cannot be turned over to the United States anyway because violating US sanctions against Iran is not a crime in Canada – failing the ""double criminality"" test. Canada's attorney-general, however, is expected to argue that her banking interactions amounted to fraud, which is a crime in Canada. Meng's legal fight could take months or even years. Ripple effect The case is being watched in part because of its potential ripple effect on ties between the three countries. Meng's arrest caused an unprecedented rift between Canada and China, which was followed up by detaining former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor on espionage suspicions. Their arrests have been widely interpreted as retribution by Beijing aimed at pressuring Canada to free Meng. The two men remain in China's opaque penal system. On the other side is the United States, which on Wednesday signed a truce with China in their lengthy trade war. Donald Trump has pushed hard for the agreement between the two economic giants and has previously suggested that he may intervene in Meng's case to keep trade negotiations on track. High (tech) stakes The US has pushed its global allies to ban Huawei equipment from domestic networks, but the campaign has met with mixed success. Australia and Japan have taken steps to block or restrict the Chinese company's participation in their 5G rollouts, and European telecommunications operators including Norway's Telenor and Sweden's Telia have passed over Huawei as a supplier. But several other European countries have not blocked the firm, with Germany resisting US pressure and even close ally Britain indicating it may be open to using some Huawei equipment. Still, Huawei executives are concerned, with Chairman Eric Xu saying in a New Year message to staff that revenue for 2019 was likely to be lower than originally forecast. ""Survival will be our first priority"" in 2020, he said. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who will be repatriated from the Middle East may be redeployed to other countries like Canada and China. On Tuesday, January 21, Bello told lawmakers this is an alternative option the government is exploring to help entice OFWs to come back to the Philippines before tensions further escalate in the Middle East due to the assassination of Iranian commander Major General Qasem Soleimani.

Filipino Margielyn Didal is on track of landing a spot in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Photo from Margielyn Didal's Instagram TOKYO, Japan – Modern upstarts skateboarding and surfing as well as the ancient martial art of karate are among new sports for 2020 ready to inject some street cred into Tokyo. AFP Sport guides you through the new kids on the Olympic block this summer: Surfing Arguably the coolest sport never to have appeared at the Olympics, surfing will be one of the hottest tickets at Tokyo 2020 – if there are waves. While the Tsurigasaki Beach venue is unlikely to produce the sort of massive barrels seen in Hawaii or Tahiti, fans should see an almighty scrap for gold with Honolulu-born John John Florence and explosive Brazilians Italo Ferreira and Gabriel Medina among the men's favourites. American Carissa Moore and Australia's seven-time world champ Stephanie Gilmore look the ones to beat in the women's competition, although Moore's countrywoman Caroline Marks and Aussie Sally Fitzgibbons might have a say. Old school ""soul surfers"" still argue that surfing is more a way of life than a sport. Try telling that to the lucky few who will be waxing down their boards at Tokyo 2020.  Skateboarding Another sport very much ""down with the kids"" is skateboarding, also brought in to help give the fuddy-duddy Olympics a trendy makeover. Divided into ""street"", run over a street-like course with a range of obstacles, and ""park"", on a hollowed-out bowl with a series of steep drops and challenging undulations, the hipster sport is poised to turn schoolchildren into global superstars chased by sponsors offering them millions of dollars. Eleven-year-old Sky Brown, who opted to skate for Britain rather than Japan and is also a professional surfer, faces Japanese world champion Misugu Okamoto, herself just 13, in what will be an absorbing women's park competition. In contrast, the men's field could see a winner who is old enough to vote with American four-time world champion Nyjah Huston a hot tip to win a historic first Olympic street gold.  Sport climbing After a spate of white-knuckle documentaries in recent years, sport climbing looks set to become another surefire hit for the Olympics. Rankings in 3 formats – one-on-one speed, the ninja-like bouldering and dynamic lead climbing – are compiled for a total score. Czech sensation Adam Ondra, who started climbing when he was six and makes the hair-raising sport look ridiculously easy, is the man to beat though he can expect to be pushed by the likes of Canada's Sean McColl, Austria's Jakob Schubert and local favourite Tomoa Narasaki. Slovenia's Janja Garnbret is one to watch in the women's event as she looks to spoil Japanese veteran Akiyo Noguchi's swan song.  Karate Long seen as the poor relation of judo, expect karate to pack a punch this summer in what will be a short-lived Olympic debut. The ancient form of warrior combat, which dates back centuries to what is now Okinawa, has been left out of the 2024 Paris Olympics – in favor of breakdancing. But Japan's Ryo Kiyuna, a native of subtropical Okinawa, will be one of those looking to leave his mark at Tokyo 2020 as the triple world champion goes for gold in the ""kata"" discipline, where fighters execute choreographed sequences of punches and kicks against an invisible opponent. Iran, whose former judo world champion Saeid Mollaei defected last year after complaining he had been ordered to lose to an Israeli rival, could be dark horses following diplomatic efforts between the International Olympic Committee and Iranian officials to negotiate an end to Tehran's decades-long boycott against Israeli athletes.  Baseball and softball Baseball makes its Olympic return in Tokyo for the first time since its controversial exit after Beijing in 2008, with what looks a wide-open tournament. South Korea stunned defending champions Cuba in the final to win gold 12 years ago to scuttle their bid for a fourth Olympic crown. But baseball-mad Japan will hope that the hosts can recapture the magic that swept them to back-to-back World Baseball Classic titles in 2006 and 2009. Japan's two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani could provide the spark for Samurai Japan, but don't back against the Americans or Cubans with the Dominican Republic also a gold medal threat. The United States will start favorites to regain the Olympic softball title they have won on four of the five occasions the competition has been held, their golden streak only halted by Japan's women in the 2008 final. – Rappler.com  "

(Photo by Fabrice Coffrini/AFP DAVOS, Switzerland (UPDATED) – US President Donald Trump on Tuesday, January 21, assailed environmental ""prophets of doom"", delivering an uncompromising message in Davos after Swedish teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg slammed government inaction on the climate crisis. Thunberg was in the audience in the Swiss Alps to hear a typically bullish speech by Trump, delivered just before the start of his Senate impeachment trial in Washington. The 50th meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) got under way in the ski resort with an avowed focus on climate change but with starkly different visions over global warming laid bare. ""We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse,"" said Trump, growling that ""they want to see us do badly"". He claimed that ""alarmists"" had been wrong on previous occasions by predicting population crisis, mass starvation and the end of oil. Trump branded those warning of out-of-control global warming and other environmental disasters ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers"". Trump told reporters later that his Davos trip was devoted to meeting ""the most important people in the world and we're bringing back tremendous business"". ""The other's just a hoax,"" he said of the ""disgraceful"" impeachment trial.  YOUTH VOICE.

Photo by Fabrice Cofffrini/AFP 'Nothing has been done' Before Trump's appearance, Thunberg underlined the message that has inspired millions around the world, saying ""basically nothing has been done"" to fight climate change. ""It will require much more than this. This is just the very beginning,"" the 17-year-old said. Speaking calmly and with a wry smile, Thunberg acknowledged that her campaign which began with school strikes had attracted huge attention without yet achieving concrete change. (READ: Davos bosses sound alarm over climate, political fires) ""There is a difference between being heard to actually leading to something,"" she said. While the WEF and individual business leaders have been detailing their own concerns about climate change, Greenpeace complained in a new report that some of the world's biggest banks, insurers and pension funds have collectively invested $1.4 trillion in fossil fuel companies since the Paris climate deal in 2016. Trump in his speech reeled off a list of achievements for the American economy and touted the United States as the ""number one producer of oil and natural gas"". Davos showdown? There are no expectations that Trump and Thunberg, who have exchanged barbs through Twitter, would actually meet, but the crowded venue and intense schedule mean a chance encounter cannot be ruled out. When Trump and his entourage walked through UN headquarters last year at the annual General Assembly, a photo of the teenager staring in apparent fury at the president from the sidelines went viral. Although Trump's Republican party holds a majority in the Senate and is almost sure to acquit him on charges of abusing his power and obstructing Congress, the impeachment adds volatility to an already tense 2020 presidential election. ""We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy,"" said Trump, apparently referring to his Democratic party opponents ahead of the presidential election in November. 'Governments continue to fail' Sustainability is the buzzword at the Davos forum, which began in 1971, with heel crampons handed out to participants to encourage them to walk on the icy streets rather than use cars, and the signage paint made out of seaweed. Trump's opposition to renewable energy, his withdrawal from the Paris accord negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama, and the free hand extended to the fossil fuel industry puts him at odds with the thrust of this year's event. ""People are paying a lot more attention"" to climate, Eurasia Group president Ian Bremner told AFP at Davos, adding there was ""genuine action by some big players"", after investment titan BlackRock said it was partially divesting out of coal. ""But let's be clear – a big part of this is because we failed for a very long time and governments continue to fail,"" he added. Business leaders are likely also to be concerned by the state of the global economy whose prospects, according to the International Monetary Fund, have improved but remain brittle. The IMF cut its global growth estimate for 2020 to 3.3 percent, saying that a recent truce in the trade war between China and the US had brought some stability but that risks remained. Activists meanwhile will be pressing for much more concrete action to fight inequality, after Oxfam issued a report outlining how the number of billionaires has doubled in the past decade and the world's 22 richest men now have more wealth than all the women in Africa. – Rappler.com "

Fighting in the United States only for the first time, Bornea was given the opportunity to headline the UFC Fight Pass card by Roy Jones Jr. owing to his excellent 14-0, 10 knockouts record. There will be no walk in the park for Bornea in the 10-rounder as he’s pitted against Delgadillo, a Mexican ring technician boasting an 11-win, no loss, 2-draw slate with 2 knockouts. Though the 24-year-old Bornea has the clear edge in power, Delgadillo, 26, is perceived to be a master strategist who has faced better competition. Bornea, born in Arakan, North Cotabato, and a resident of General Santos City, impressed Jones when he stopped his last three opponents. Bornea, a former amateur standout with international exposure, is wrapping up training at the Wild Card Gym of renowned trainer Freddie Roach in Hollywood under the guidance of Stanley Godinez and former world champion Rodel Mayol.

Former SAF chief Getulio NapeÃ±as Jr (left) and former PNP chief Alan Purisima. Rappler file photos MANILA, Philippines – The Mamasapano bloodbath case is over. For now. A special division of the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan on Tuesday, January 21, promulgated an 18-page decision clearing former police chief Alan Purisima and former Special Action Force (SAF) chief Getulio Napeñas in the graft and usurpation of official functions charges against them over the 2015 Mamasapano bloodbath. ""The charges against (Napeñas) are ordered dismissed for lack of probable cause, without prejudice to the filing of appropriate charges,"" the court said in the decision penned by Associate Justice Alex Quiroz with concurrences from Associate Justices Reynaldo Cruz and Michael Frederick Musngi. Associate Justice Bayani Jacinto dissented. Presiding Justice Amparo Cabotaje Tang concurred and dissented. We have yet to see copies of Jacinto and Tang's separate opinions. ""The charges against (Purisima) are dismissed without prejudice to the filing of the appropriate charges against him,"" the court added. For Purisima and Napeñas, the Sandiganbayan 4th Division ruled on merits, unlike in the case of former president Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino III where the court granted Ombudsman Samuel Martires' request to withdraw. Martires withdrew the charges filed during the time of former ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales because the former believed a president cannot ever be charged of usurping official functions. First, what were the charges? Purisima and Napeñas were charged of violating Section 3(a) of the anti-graft law which punishes ""persuading, inducing or influencing another public officer to perform an act constituting a violation of rules and regulations."" They were charged because Purisima was already suspended from the Philippine National Police (PNP) when he led Oplan Exodus – a bungled operation to kill terrorists Zulkifli bin Hir or Marwan and Abdul Basit Usman, but which resulted in the deaths of 44 SAF commandos. Morales' theory was that Purisima's lead role in the operation despite his suspension amounted to graft. Napeñas and Aquino were accused of conspiracy so they were charged too. All 3 of them were also charged of usurpation of official functions because of the same thing – that Purisima usurped an official function even though he was suspended. What's the ruling? The Fourth Division said there was no crime of graft because Purisima and Napeñas did not receive ""any consideration."" ""The Court rules that there can be no violation of Section 3(a) of R.A No. 3019 if it is not alleged and established that there is a receipt of or at least an expectation to receive any consideration in the use of influence,"" said the decision. Section 3(a) makes no mention of receiving something in return for the illegal act. It only says: ""Persuading, inducing or influencing another public officer to perform an act constituting a violation of rules and regulations duly promulgated by competent authority or an offense in connection with the official duties of the latter, or allowing himself to be persuaded, induced, or influenced to commit such violation or offense."" But the court said it was in keeping up with the spirit of the law and not the letter of it. For the usurpation of official functions charges, the court also cleared Purisima and Napeñas because of the element of ""pretense of official function."" Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code defines usurpation of official function as ""any person who shall knowingly and falsely represent himself to be an officer, agent or representative of any department or agency of the Philippine Government or of any foreign government, or who, under pretense of official position, shall perform any act pertaining to any person in authority or public officer of the Philippine Government or any foreign government, or any agency thereof, without being lawfully entitled to do so."" (Emphasis ours) The court said there was no pretense of official position because it was Aquino who assigned Purisima to the operation. ""The orders to accused Purisima relative to the purported mission planning and supervision directly came from Aquino, who cannot be accused of and be found liable for usurpation of official functions,"" the court said. The court added: ""It cannot be said that accused Purisima was under the pretense of being a PNP Chief precisely because he was ordered by his President and Commander-in-Chief to perform such supervision and monitoring."" What happens now? It has always been the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption or VACC's position that the graft and usurpation charges were weak and designed to fail. The group refiled in November 44 counts of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide against Aquino. Their theory is that Aquino et al's neglect was the proximate cause of the deaths of the 44 SAF commandos. Proximate cause is defined in past Supreme Court cases as a kind of negligence that produces an event ""without which the event would not have occurred."" Morales dismissed this theory during her time. Ombudsman Samuel Martires would have to decide on the refiled case. But the Supreme Court in September issued a resolution saying ""there is no probable cause to charge private respondents with reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide."" Despite the clear language of the ruling that ""there is no probable cause"" to charge Aquino, Chief Justice Diosdaro Peralta claimed in an earlier press conference that the issue of probable cause should be resolved by the lower court. ""We do not want to encroach on the very power of the lower court to determine the existence of probable cause. What we only rule upon is the Rule 65 to determine there is grave abuse of discretion that's what we said in our ruling,"" said Peralta. – Rappler.com "

Medical staff members carry a patient into the Jinyintan hospital, where patients infected by a mysterious SARS-like virus are being treated, in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on January 18, 2020. Photo by AFP MANILA, Philippines (2nd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, January 30, confirmed the first case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines.  The country's first 2019-nCoV patient is among the 29 people being monitored by the DOH. The World Health Organization (WHO) said the mode of transmission for the virus is still being determined, though a Beijing government expert said it could be contagious between humans. Here’s what we know so far: When did it start? The first cases of nCoV were revealed by Chinese state media on December 31, after 44 people from the Chinese city of Wuhan were confirmed to be infected. Initial reports referred to the disease as “mystery viral pneumonia,” as infected people exhibited flu-like symptoms like persistent coughing, fever, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing. Where did it come from? The infections started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, a city of 11 million. It is the capital of China’s Hubei province and also serves as a major transport hub in the country. Officials in Wuhan have put in place strict screening measures of people traveling out of the city, with medics even taking passengers’ temperatures before planes are allowed to fly out. The city is also currently on lockdown, effectively trapping its citizens. So far, cases have been confirmed in all regions of China. The virus has also reached South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, India, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, the US, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates, with most cases confirmed in people with history of travel to Wuhan. Health officials in China have said that the virus probably originated in animals and was transmitted to humans by contact with animals at a live market, but such suspicion has yet to be confirmed. Chinese officials in China have also said that the virus can spread from person to person, and the WHO said there is sufficient evidence to say so. How is it related to SARS and MERS? The pneumonia-like disease caused by the 2019-nCoV is similar to SARS and MERS in that nCoV, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, is also a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that can cause a range of diseases in humans and animals – diseases as simple as the common cold to diseases like MERS and SARS. (READ: What is coronavirus? New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears) MERS is a viral respiratory disease that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. By the end of 2015, 483 deaths and a total of 1,180 cases were reported in the Middle East. MERS symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pneumonia may also be present, but not always. Though it remains unknown where exactly the virus came from, health officials have said that the virus might have come from camels, which is common in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. SARS is another viral respiratory disease which originated in Guangdong province, southern China in 2003. A SARS epidemic spread to 26 countries in 2003, resulting in a total of 8,000 cases and over 800 deaths in China and Hong Kong. Transmitted by human-to-human contact, it is characterized by the following flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, diarrhea, shivering, dry cough, and shortness of breath. The virus is believed to have come from bats and spread to other animals. Unlike MERS that was found to infect mostly older men with chronic conditions, SARS was found to infect both health and unhealthy individuals. It is not yet known whether the 2019 disease infecting over 7,000 in China is caused by a more severe kind of coronavirus like MERS and SARS, but the WHO has emphasized that many of those who have died due to the new virus had pre-existing illnesses. Like MERS and SARS, though, the disease emerging from the 2019-nCoV cannot be treated through vaccination. Control of the disease is done through close monitoring, symptom management, and rest. How severe is it? WHO has declared the current 2019-nCoV situation in China a public health emergency of international concern. ""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said after the WHO emergency council meeting on January 30. Tedros also said there was no reason for any of the international travel or trade restrictions with current evidence. WHO’s country representative to the Philippines, Rabindra Abeyasinghe, said in a January 21 press briefing that “it is too early to say this is a severe disease.” There are two crucial indicators that health authorities look at to assess the severity of a potential pandemic: how infectious it is and how deadly. Infectiousness is measured by what is called R0 (R-naught). Scientific knowledge about 2019-nCoV is still expanding, but for now scientists have pegged the virus's R0 at 1.4 to 2.5. This means an infected person can potentially spread it to 1 to 2 others. This would mean that 2019-nCoV is less contagious that SARS, whose R0 is 3. Measles turns out to be more contagious, with an R0 of 11-18. But it is more contagious that the seasonal flu, whose R0 is 1.8. Another indicator is how deadly it is, which is measured through the case fatality rate (CFR). With 212 deaths and a total of 8,236 cases as of January 31, 2019-nCoV has a CFR of about 2.6%. This is lower than SARS, whose CFR was 10%, and MERS, whose CFR was about 35%. But this figure is not unshakeable, as figures continue to rise. “We still need to understand better the mode of transmission and what needs to be done specifically for management,” WHO's Abeyasinghe added. WHO recommends the use of tried and tested guidelines used for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. DOH and WHO are reminding people to practice proper hygiene, as transmission may be from contacts with animals or other humans. They have also advised the public to practice frequent handwashing and avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. Proper cough etiquette is to be observed as well: maintaining distance and covering your nose and mouth with tissue, a towel, or the crook of your elbow. DOH and WHO are also calling on people to ensure that food is well-cooked while the potential source of the virus is still being identified. What is the government doing? The health department’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) is on high alert, especially with travelers from Wuhan and China manifesting fever or signs of respiratory infection. The BOQ has met with airlines to remind them of measures to observe in light of the scare. They will ensure that airlines have universal protective kits on board and remind them of protocols in handling cases on board and reporting cases to authorities on the ground. DOH also said that health workers are also expected to be more vigilant when in contact with patients with acute respiratory infection, especially those with travel history to China. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippines’ “detection capability is still evolving.” The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), DOH’s main research arm for prevention and control of infectious and tropical diseases, now has the test kit necessary to determine whether a sample is positive for the 2019-nCoV. Duque has also led a meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, which has discouraged non-essential travel to China. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) will also begin repatriating Filipinos in Wuhan and Hubei province by the first week of February. Duque had earlier said that travel restrictions may not be necessary, as WHO does not recommend them, but later said he would propose a travel ban on all people coming from Wuhan and Hubei province to the President. Lawmakers and citizens have called on the government to impose a temporary travel ban on all of China. – Rappler.com Sources: World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health "

Infographic from the PCOO shows supposed accomplishments by the Duterte government 'as of January 9, 2020.' Photo from Philippine News Agency For one, the infographic stated that the numbers were “updated as of January 9, 2020” but a closer look shows each figure covered different periods of time and were released on different dates. There were also no footnotes or sources included on the graphic, making it hard to put the numbers in context. A fact check on the infographics's numbers revealed the following: Claim: PH ranked 49th in the World Talent Ranking 2019 Context: The Philippines placed 49th in the World Talent Ranking released by the International Institute for Management Development in November 2019, but its ranking was out of a total of 63 countries. The Philippines has remained at the bottom half of the list in the last few years: 47th in 2013, 55th in 2014, 57th in 2015, 55th in 2016, 45th in 2017, and 55th in 2018. The World Talent Ranking assesses each country’s investment and development of home-grown talent. It can be fully accessed here. Claim: 0.8% inflation rate, lowest since May 2016 Context: Although the Philippines recorded a 0.8% inflation rate in October 2019, it was also under the Duterte government when the country’s inflation rate spiked to 6.7%, which was recorded in September and October 2018. This was the highest recorded in 9 years, or since March 2009. Made with Flourish  In the months following the October 2019 rate, inflation surged again but within the government's targets: at 1.3% in November and 2.5% in December, the latest as of writing. Claim: 4.5% unemployment rate, lowest since 2005 Context: The latest available unemployment rate was as of October 2019, not January 2020. However, the unemployment rate did fall to a 14-year low across all quarters. This meant the population of those who do not have jobs dropped to 2.05 million from 2.2 million in October 2018. The underemployment rate also declined to 13% in October 2019 from the 13.3% recorded in the same month in the previous year. But while the underemployment rate declined, the actual number of those who have jobs but are looking for more increased to 5.62 million from 5.5 million. (READ: Unemployment, underemployment dip to 14-year low in October 2019) Chart by JC Punongbayan Chart by JC Punongbayan In his assessment of Duterte's midterm performance in July 2019, economist AJ Montesa said the administration “benefitted from the sustained economic growth in the past decade,” hence the improvement in the country's employment situation. Claim: 200,000 fewer families experiencing involuntary hunger Context: This number was most likely derived from a survey conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS) on the incidence of involuntary hunger in the country. While it is the latest available as of writing, it only covers the third quarter of 2019. The survey was done from September 27 to 30. The 200,000 fewer families highlighted by the government is also only relative to the number recorded in the previous quarter, which stood at 2.5 million. Families who experienced involuntary hunger stood at 2.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 – of which around 426,000 families said they experienced severe hunger and 1.8 million families said they felt moderate hunger. SWS defines involuntary hunger as the “hunger experienced by the family due to lack of food to eat.” The Duterte administration has sustained the decrease in Filipinos’ involuntary hunger, save for the spike in December 2017. Jose Ramon Albert, senior research fellow at the Philippine Institute for Development Studies, explained in his assessment in July 2019 that since hunger is correlated with prices, the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law may have mitigated the effects of the increase in prices among the poor. Claim: 5.6% families reporting victimization by common crimes Context: The number cited in the infographic came from an SWS survey on families victimized by common crimes, but the latest report available as of writing only covers the third quarter of 2019. The actual survey was conducted from September 27 to 30. An estimated 1.4 million families reported victimization by common crimes during this period, such as pickpocketing or robbery of personal property, break-ins, carnapping, and physical violence within the past 6 months. Based on data from SWS, the number of families that reported victimization has been on a downward trend since the first quarter of 2019. Claim: 5.9 million Filipinos lifted out of poverty Context: The number cited was most likely derived from the Philippine Statistics Authority’s (PSA) full year poverty statistics. However, the latest available figure was for the year 2018. PSA said the proportion of poor Filipinos was at 16.6%, or a population of 17.6 million in 2018. This is lower than the 23.3% poverty incidence in 2015, which translated to 23.5 million Filipinos. PSA only releases poverty figures every 3 years. The next would be released in 2021. Claim: 4,199,288 jobs generated through Build Build Build Context: The number came from Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar, as stated in a May 2019 article. These were jobs generated from ""the road, bridge, flood-control, and other infrastructure projects of the department all over the country,"" he said. However, economist JC Punongbayan pointed out in his article that ""this statistic is implausible."" (READ: [ANALYSIS] The economic lies in ‘Duterte Legacy’) ""As of October 2019, there were 4.22 million people employed in the construction industry. Does Duterte Legacy mean to say BBB created nearly as many construction jobs as there currently are?"" Punongbayan said. He also added that based on Labor Force Surveys, there were only 719,000 more construction jobs in October 2019 than in July 2016, when Duterte assumed office. Moreover, this figure includes both public and private construction jobs. Claim: 64 airports, 243 seaports, 2,709 bridges, 9,845 kilometers of roads Context: These numbers are not all newly-built infrastructure. These figures include projects involving the repair, rehabilitation, upgrade, widening, or expansion of existing ones. (READ: CONTEXT: Number of airports, seaports, bridges, roads in 'Duterte legacy' graphic) Claim: 596,859 decent and affordable housing Context: In the midterm report presented by the Duterte administration in May 2019, the government said a total of 596,859 housing units were provided from July 2016 to May 2019. These units were provided through the Home Development Mutual Fund or Pag-IBIG (262,874 units), National Housing Authority (187,609), Home Guaranty Corporation (112,710), and Social Housing Finance Corporation (33,666). However, this number is still below the government’s target as spelled out in the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022: around 6.8 million units. Claim: 2,799 children involved in illegal drugs activities rescued, 726 government workers arrested in anti-drug operations, 8,185 high-value targets arrested, 16,706 drug-cleared barangays Context: The data came from #RealNumbersPH, the government’s “unitary report” on Duterte’s anti-drug campaign. The numbers cited were the latest available as of writing, but they included only data obtained from July 2016 to November 2019. However, the infographic left out the number of drug personalities killed during police operations, which stood at 5,552 based also on #RealNumbersPH data. Carlos Conde, Human Rights Watch’s researcher for the Philippines, has also questioned the numbers' integrity. “We can't trust the police to make any assessments of how the drug war is done precisely because the police are the ones complicit in the killings,” he told Rappler in July 2019. Claim: 15 treatment and rehabilitation centers Context: The number refers only to public rehabilitation centers, or those run by the Department of Health. There are 53 licensed drug abuse treatment and rehabilitation centers nationwide, according to a PNA report. – Rappler.com "

Alab is currently undergoing a hectic transition in the 2020 ASEAN Basketball League season, with 3 World Import changes already made early on. After the sudden departure of ABL Champion and Defensive Player of the Year Renaldo Balkman, the team signed streaky forward Nick King. Maltese monster Sam Deguara later joined the fold, replacing Adrian Forbes after just one game. Finally, clutch combo guard Khalif Wyatt left Alab after their last loss to the Singapore Slingers, prompting the team to tap Prince William prior to their Thursday, January 23 road game against Hong Kong Eastern. If ever Alab pulls the trigger on Brownlee, head coach Jimmy Alapag will finally have a proven superstar back under his wing who can do practically anything a team needs from him. During his last stint in the ABL, the star trio of Brownlee, Balkman and 3-time Local MVP Ray Parks terrorized opposing teams en route to a hard-earned title in Alapag’s coaching debut season in 2018. Without Brownlee in 2019, however, Alab struggled mightily in the playoffs and suffered a stunning two-game upset sweep to Hong Kong Eastern after an 18-8 finish in the regular season. After months of roster reshuffling, will Brownlee finally be the last piece Alab needs to get over the hump? – Rappler.com "

169,249873,"January 24, 2020",Thought Leaders,[OPINYON] Bago ka magtanong ng ‘Ilang taon ka na?’,Joselito D. Delos Reyes,"Tinanong ko, in a very polite manner, kung ilang taon na ang tsuper. Naglitanya si kuya. Kesyo nakakainsulto na raw. Napataas pa ang boses. Nagalit yata sa akin dahil sa pagiging mausisa ko.   Malayo pa ang birthday ko pero kailangan ko lang matalakay ito: edad. Gaano katagal nang nabubuhay sa mundong ibabaw. Kung ilang taon na, ilang ikot ng mundo sa araw habang nabubuhay ang isang tao. Mukhang harmless na isyu ang human construct ng edad, pero hindi.  Ganito kasi iyon. Gaya marahil ng karamihang commuter ng Kalakhang Maynilang kahapis-hapis, kung pupunta rin lang ako sa lugar na bihira kong puntahan, pinagsasabay-sabay ko na ang dapat gawin. Para isang sakit na lang ng katawan sa pagsagupa sa trapiko. Kaya, noong isang araw, isang tuhog na lang lahat ang 5 appointment sa Quezon City. Oo, sa Quezon City lang. Mula sa Maynila, sa apartment na tinutuluyan ko sa Sampaloc, bihira akong magawi sa Quezon City. Naglalakad lang ako pagpasok sa trabaho, at kung umuuwi sa probinsiya, sa malayong ruta sa Timog Katagalugan, iyon, doon lang ako nagko-commute. Out of way sa akin ang Quezon City. Kaya pinaplano kong mabuti ang mga lakad ko kung lalabas sa aking Sampaloc comfort zone. Unang appointment, sa isang major network, para kumuha ng isang dokumento na magagamit sa promosyon ko sana sa trabaho. Ikalawa, sa isang malaking mall sa malapit sa network, para makipag-meeting sa isang tao. Ikatlo, sa UP Diliman, para puntahan ang isang opisinang may pangako sa aking ibibigay na mga aklat. Ikaapat, kausapin naman ang isang propesor sa dako ring iyon para ikonsulta ang isang proyekto. Huli, makipagkumustahan sa isa pang kaibigang propesor sa UP na ilang taon na ring hindi nakakakumustahan nang personal. Tungkol sa edad ang naging simula ng kumustahan namin ng propesor na huling dahilan kung bakit nga ako dumayo sa lupalop na iyon ng Diliman. Matagal ko nang kaibigan, mula pa noong late ’90s, ang propesor na ito. At noong araw na iyon, kuwento niya sa akin, pinagpaplanuhan na niya ang napipintong pagreretiro. Nabigla ako. Lumipas ang panahon na hindi ko nabibilang ang kaniyang edad. Biruan nga namin, parang kailan lang ang lahat. Mabilis. Gasgas na kataga to the point of cliché na parang kailan nga lang ang lahat, hayun at pagreretiro na ang kaniyang iniisip. Limot naman ng propesor na ito kung ilang taon na ako, kaya nang sabihin ko ang edad ko, kahit pa kaibigan ko, parang kayhirap niyang papaniwalain na 43 years old ako. Sa dami ba naman ng uban ko sa bumbunan, sa dami ng pileges sa mukhang sinalanta ng karanasan; sa hitsura talaga, kaya talagang maraming hindi naniniwala sa totoong edad ko. Iniisip nila, siguro, mga 50 anyos na. Masakit dati ang mga pasaring, lalo ang totoong pagkabigla pagkatapos malaman ang totoo. Pero nakasanayan ko na naman. Nagsimula ang kuwentuhan namin tungkol sa mga plano sa pagreretiro at sa edad habang naghihintay ng taxi para magtungo sa isang restaurant. Tuloy ang kuwentuhan tungkol sa edad hanggang sa makasakay. Hanggang sa baybayin ng taxi ang kahabaan ng Quezon Avenue. Habang nakaipit sa inaasahang traffic, napansin ko ang katabi kong tsuper. Sa hitsura, sigurado akong senior citizen. Payat, hukot, pero sigurado ang pagmamaneho. Beterano. At dito na naglundo ang dahilan kung bakit paksa ko ang edad. Tinanong ko, in a very polite manner, kung ilang taon na ang tsuper. “Kung okay lang pong malaman, Kuya, kung ilang taon ka na po?” Ganyan. Magalang. Maingat. Kuya at hindi tatay. Lalong hindi lolo. At kung sasagutin, nakahanda ko nang itanong ang kasunod, kung ilang taon nang nagmamaneho. Puwede naman niyang sagutin na “hindi okay” na malaman ang kaniyang edad dahil bahagi naman iyon ng tanong ko. Kaya nga “kung okay lang,” ’ka ko. Obviously, hindi okay. Kaya naglitanya si kuya. Kesyo nakakainsulto na raw na tanungin siya kung ilang taon na, marami na raw nagtanong at hindi niya sinasagot. Para saan pa daw ba? Et cetera. Napataas pa ang boses. Nagalit yata sa akin dahil sa pagiging mausisa ko. Humingi ako ng paumanhin sa pag-uusisa. Pasensiya na, ’ka ko. Okay lang naman kung talagang ayaw niyang ipaalam. ’Buti na lang, malapit na kami sa pupuntahang restaurant. That, I think, was the height of my insensitivity. Noon pa man, alam ko nang impolite magtanong hinggil sa edad ng isang tao. Lalo kung walang gatol at pakundangan. May ibang ipinagmamalaki ang tunay na edad, lalo kung mukhang bata o epektibo ang pagpapamukhang-bata regimen, pero merong ibang ikinukubli ang totoo. Nagiging tampulan biruan o asaran. At kung anuman ang dahilan sa pagtatago ng totoong edad, dapat igalang. Unless, of course, kailangang-kailangan. Ipinapangaral ko iyon sa mga klase ko simula pa noong una. Pero kung gusto talagang malaman, pangunahan ng ganito ang tanong: “Kung okay lang, p’wede po bang malaman kung ilang taon na kayo?” Or “Would you mind if I ask how old are you?” Ganyan, dahil may mga tao talagang ayaw mapag-uusapan ang edad kaya dapat alamin muna kung okay lang, or if they will mind. Bahagi ng tanong ko sa tsuper ang “kung okay lang,” pero, siyempre, sa antas ng pragmatics, hindi naman na ito bahagi ng statement. Mas mapapansin ang kung ilang taon na. Diretsohan pa rin, wala pa ring pakundangan ang dating sa kaniya. Nakalala pa marahil ang paksa ng kuwentuhan namin ng kaibigan kong propesor habang bumibiyahe: pagreretiro. Samantalang hayun si kuyang tsuper, mukhang retirado na sana pero kailangan pang pumasada. Ang sama ko. Kaya dati may pagkakataong hindi rin ako diretso kung sumagot kung ilang taon na ako. Dati, may halong pagkainis, sasagutin ko nang totoo. Tapos magdududa ang nagtatanong. “Forty-three ka lang? Weh?” halimbawa. Sasabihin ko, “’Tatanong ka, tapos hindi ka maniniwala.” Nabubuwisit ako noon. Again, manhid na ako ngayon. Dahil napakapersonal sa marami sa atin ang usapin ng edad. Some people don’t want to look their age. Kaya nga laganap ang produktong magpapamukhang bata: pampakinis ng balat, pampaitim ng buhok, cosmetic products and surgery, pormahang usong-uso. Ito ang alok ng mga tagline at patalastas, halimbawa, ng sabong magtatanggal o magkukubli ng wrinkles sa mukha o magpapatubo ng buhok sa ulong dumaranas ng taglagas. Maliit na usapin kung susuriin. Edad. Numero. Ilang ikot ba ng mundo? Pero sa iba, napakasensitibo. Kaya noong araw na iyon, hindi lang ako basta tumanda. Muli akong nagtanda. – Rappler.com Bukod sa pagtuturo ng creative writing, pop culture, research, at seminar in new media sa Departamento ng Literatura at sa Graduate School ng Unibersidad ng Santo Tomas, Research Fellow din si Joselito D.

170,249874,"January 21, 2020",US & Canada,Historic Trump impeachment trial to begin in earnest,Agence France-Presse,"The 100 members of the Senate will decide if Trump abused his office and obstructed Congress as charged in the two articles of impeachment approved last month by the House of Representatives  DONALD IN DAVOS. US President Donald Trump arrives in Davos, Switzerland, on January 21, 2020, for the World Economic Forum. Photo by Jim Watson/AFP WASHINGTON, DC, USA – President Donald Trump's historic impeachment trial begins in earnest on Tuesday, January 21, in the Senate, with Democrats calling for his removal from office and Republicans determined to acquit him – and quickly, if possible. Four months after the Ukraine scandal exploded and went on to overshadow the end of Trump's term, and 10 months before Americans go to the polls to decide whether to re-elect him, the 100 members of the Senate will gather at 1 pm (1800 GMT) with Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts presiding over the trial. The job of these lawmakers, sworn in last week as jurors, is to decide if Trump abused his office and obstructed Congress as charged in the two articles of impeachment approved last month by the House of Representatives. They state that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 US election to help him win, and then tried to thwart a congressional probe of his behavior. It will be only the third time a president has endured an impeachment trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999. Part of the scandal centers on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's potential opponent in the November vote. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives and led the investigation, accuse Trump of manipulating Ukraine by withholding nearly $400 million in military aid for its war against Russian-backed separatists and a White House meeting for Zelensky until the latter announced a Biden probe. 'Nothing wrong' ""The president did nothing wrong,"" Trump's lawyers responded in a 110-page brief submitted to the Senate on Monday. This echoes the repeated assertions of the 73-year-old real estate magnate that the saga is a political witch hunt and a hoax, and that his phone call with the Ukrainian leader was ""perfect."" In the president's brief, his 12-man legal team contested the very idea of his impeachment. They called the two articles of impeachment – approved largely along party lines in the Democratic-controlled House – the product of ""a rigged process"" and ""constitutionally deficient on their face"" because they involved no violation of established law. That team, which has recruited high-profile lawyers such as Kenneth Starr, who tried to bring down Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, said in the brief: ""The Senate should reject the Articles of Impeachment and acquit the president immediately."" 'Worst nightmare' ""President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardizing our national security, the integrity of our elections, and our democracy,"" the House managers said Saturday in a memorandum. They said the president's behavior ""is the Framers' worst nightmare,"" referring to the authors of the US Constitution, and that Trump deserves to be removed from office. But Trump looks almost certain to be acquitted because of the 53-47 Republican majority in the Senate. He will be abroad as his trial opens. Trump arrived Tuesday in snowy Davos, Switzerland, ahead of his scheduled speech to the World Economic Forum. How long the trial will last is up in the air. The first order of business Tuesday will be to set the rules, such as how long they will hear the arguments of the House managers, or prosecutors; how long they will hear the defense; the time allotted for questions, submitted by the senators but read by Roberts; and whether they will call witnesses or seek other evidence. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell late Monday proposed rules calling for each side to have 24 hours over two days to present their arguments. That makes for long trial days stretching late into the night but is a significantly quicker pace than in Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. The chamber will debate and vote on the proposed rules Tuesday. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said McConnell is rushing the trial and also making it harder for witnesses and documents to be presented. ""On something as important as impeachment, Senator McConnell's resolution is nothing short of a national disgrace,"" Schumer said in a statement. The Democrats want key Trump administration officials to testify, such as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, in the belief that they know a lot about Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Bolton has said he is willing to testify if subpoenaed. The White House has said it expects the trial to be over in two weeks. Clinton's trial lasted five weeks. McConnell has said he won't consider the witness issue until after the arguments and questioning take place, and his majority means he will likely prevail. – Rappler.com "
171,249875,"January 21, 2020",Philippines,House names non-Cordilleran as Benguet caretaker congressman,Frank Cimatu,"The law requires that a special election be held after the death of Benguet Representative Nestor Fongwan Jr, and that's what residents call for  Photo from congress.gov.ph BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The House of Representatives has appointed party list congressman Eric Go Yap of ACT-CIS as caretaker of Benguet after the death of Representative Nestor Fongwan Sr. This was announced by Benguet Governor Melchor Diclas on Monday, January 20, but many residents are not having any of it — they want special elections to be held to find a replacement for Fongwan. At the very least, they would have wanted either Baguio Representative Marques Go or Mountain Province Representative Maximo Dalog Jr as caretaker congressman since they are Benguet's neighbors. When the father of Mountain Province's Dalog, Maximo Sr, died in June 2017, it was Kalinga Representative Allen Jesse Mangaoang who was named caretaker of the province. Yap is not a Cordilleran and staunch supporter of President Duterte. His party-list organization is associated with the Tulfo siblings. The designation of Yap as caretaker representative – if it becomes permanent – will go against the law. Republic Act No. 6645, which provides for the filling of vacancies in the legislature, states that when a district representative's seat becomes vacant a year or more before the term ends, a special election will be held for a new representative. Fongwan won in the May 2019 election, and died in December, so Yap's appointment was made barely 40 days after the seat was vacated. Judging from the reactions on Facebook, Benguet supporters are either surprised, disgusted, or open to the choice. Many are in favor of holding a special election. Benguet Provincial Board has passed a resolution asking Congress to initiate a special election to fill Fongwan’s vacant post. Vice Governor Johnny Waguis said they had informed House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano about their resolution as early as January 13. During Fongwan's wake in December, however, Cayetano hinted at caretakership as the solution. Caretakers designated by past Speakers had met criticism as well – such as when Gloria Macapagal Arroyo appointed Pangasinan's Rose Marie Arenas as caretaker of Batanes, and Feliciano Belmonte Jr appointed Akbayan's Kaka Bag-ao as Dinagat caretaker. They all cited tradition. – Rappler.com   "

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, speaking before a Brussels meeting with EU counterparts, said: ""Macron and Trump had a very constructive discussion... and they agreed to avoid all escalation between the US and France on this digital tax issue."" A French diplomatic source said the French and US leaders, who spoke by telephone on Sunday, agreed to give negotiations a chance to ""find a solution in an international framework"" and avoid ""a trade war that will benefit no one"". Macron tweeted Monday that he had had a ""great discussion"" with Trump on the issue. ""We will work together on a good agreement to avoid tariff escalation,"" he said. ""Excellent!"" replied Trump on Twitter. The White House said the two men spoke and ""agreed it is important to complete successful negotiations on the digital services tax, and they also discussed other bilateral issues."" The dispute began last year when Paris approved a levy of up to 3% on revenues earned by technology companies in France, as international efforts dragged on to find a new model for taxing revenues earned via online sales and advertising. Tech companies often pay little tax in countries in which they are not physically present. Washington said the tax singled out US companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix. It threatened retaliatory duties of up to 100 percent of the value of French imports of such emblematic goods as Champagne and Camembert cheese. The European Union had said it would back France if such tariffs were levied, raising the prospect of a transatlantic trade war. 'Remains a difficult negotiation' On January 7, Paris and Washington had given themselves 15 days to reach a deal to avert the US threat of duties on up to $2.4 billion of French goods. Le Maire, who has been conducting intensive negotiations for the last several weeks, had been scheduled to hold crunch talks on the issue with US counterpart Steven Mnuchin at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. After confirming the reprieve, Le Maire told journalists in Brussels that he spoke with Mnuchin by telephone on Sunday and ""our technical teams are in contact day and night to work on a solution"". He stressed that ""this remains a difficult negotiation.... A certain number of details need to be worked out, but I believe we're going in the right direction."" Le Maire declined, however, to say whether France would suspend its digital tax. ""I am not going to get into the details of the negotiation. I prefer that that remains between Mnuchin and myself,"" he said. Nevertheless, according to concurring sources, France is willing to suspend the tax ""to provide some time"" to find a solution under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

179,249883,"January 21, 2020",Philippines,Duterte's satisfaction rating reaches new record-high,Sofia Tomacruz,"President Rodrigo Duterte gets a new record satisfaction rating of 'excellent,' with 82% of Filipinos saying they are satisfied with his performance as Chief Executive  PERSONAL BEST. President Rodrigo Duterte wraps up 2019 with a new high in public satisfaction rating. Malacañang photo MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte has achieved his highest net satisfaction rating so far, setting a new personal record that surpassed his previous ratings, a recent Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey showed. In the SWS survey conducted from December 13 to 16, 2019, Duterte garnered a net satisfaction rating of +72 or ""excellent"" for his presidency. He bested his own ""very good"" +65 in September 2019, and his previous high score of ""very good"" +68 in June 2019. The latest poll saw 82% of Filipinos satisfied with Duterte as chief executive. The numbers are 4 points higher than his 78% in September 2019. Another 8% of Filipinos said they were undecided, while 10% were dissatisfied with Duterte's performance. The survey was done a few days after Duterte upped the ante against private water concessionaires Maynilad and Manila Water over what he believed to be ""onerous"" provisions in their concession agreements. He threatened an immediate government takeover of water distribution and treatment operations. The poll was also done as Duterte certified as urgent a measure that sought to raise the take-home pay of government workers, including public school teachers. Other findings: The SWS survey found that majority of respondents (52%) expected Duterte to fulfil ""all or nearly all/most of his promises."" Meanwhile, 42% of Filipinos answered they expected a ""few"" to be fulfilled, and 5% answered ""none or almost none."" This was the case for all areas, as SWS recorded an increase in expectations that Duterte would fulfil his promises in Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The same survey found 72% or a big majority of Filipinos saying they are worried about Duterte's health, similar to the 74% who were worried in June 2019. Of the 72% who were worried, SWS found 5% worried a great deal while 47% somewhat worried. Alongside this, the pollster also found a similar big majority – or 61% – saying “Duterte’s state of health is a public matter"" and that the public should be informed of ""everything about this."" This was unchanged from September 2018, when 61% said the President’s state of health was a public matter. Concern over Duterte's health was highest in his bailiwick of Mindanao, where 77% of Filipinos said they were worried. This, however, was actually lower than findings in June 2019 when 85% said they were worried. Mindanao was followed by the Visayas at 75%, Metro Manila at 73%, and Balance Luzon at 69%. What island regions think of Duterte's performance: Duterte's 7-point rise in his satisfaction rating was buoyed by increases in Balance Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao, combined with a steady score in Metro Manila. While Duterte's rating stayed at a very good +66 in Metro Manila from September 2019 to December 2019, it increased by 12 points in Balance Luzon from +54 in September to +66 in December. There was a 5-point increase (+76 to +81) in Mindanao and 4-point increase in Visayas (+75 to +79). Satisfaction likewise rose in both urban and rural areas, with a 9-point increase seen in urban areas (+75 in December 2019 from +66 in September 2019) and 5-point increase in rural areas (+69 from +64). Poorest Filipinos happier: Duterte managed to raise his net satisfaction ratings among all economic classes. But his ratings saw a marked improvement among the country's poorest, those in class E. Class E Filipinos gave him a 14-point increase from September (+57) to December (+71). SWS said this surpassed his previous record +68 in June 2017. Likewise, Duterte's satisfaction also rose from very good to excellent in class D, up by 6 points from +66 in September to +72 in December. It stayed excellent in class ABC, at +76 in December, up by 6 points from +70 in September. How Duterte fared among graduates: Duterte saw the biggest movements in satisfaction ratings amon college graduates, high school graduates, and elementary graduates. The biggest increase was seen among elementary school graduates who gave Duterte an 18-pointincrease from +60 in September to +78 in December. This was followed by a 6-point increase among college graduates (+67 to +73) and 3-point increase among high school graduates (+67 to +70). Duterte's net satisfaction stayed very good among non-elementary school graduates, from +65 in September to +64 in December. The end-of-the-year survey involved face-to-face interviews with 1,200 adults nationwide. SWS reported error margins of ±3% for national percentages, and ±6% each for Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. – Rappler.com "

The paper said the two men, who were stopped but not arrested in August 2019, were suspected of carrying out ""preparatory work"" for spying on the World Economic Forum, which is taking place in Davos this week. ""It was a regular police check. Both men had Russian diplomatic passports but were not formally registered as diplomats in Switzerland,"" Anita Senti, a spokeswoman for the local cantonal police in Graubuenden, told AFP. The paper reported that ""at least one of the men"" said he was a plumber and that they had told police they were staying in the expensive resort town for three weeks between August 8 and August 28, arousing suspicion. The annual summit brings together top global political and business leaders, with US President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel among those attending this year, making it an obvious potential target for a spying operation. ""We did not receive any information about this from Swiss authorities. There is no evidence of spying,"" Russian embassy spokesman Stanislav Smirnov told AFP. ""I don't rule out that it may have been people with Russian diplomatic passports -- they do not necessarily need to be accredited in Switzerland,"" Smirnov said. Asked why one of the men had claimed to be a plumber, Smirnov said it may have been a ""stupid joke"" by the man. Tages Anzeiger said the men may have been preparing a wiretapping or hacking operation in Davos, and cited several sources saying that Russian officials ""threatened diplomatic consequences if the men were arrested"". The paper said the Swiss Attorney General's Office had not opened criminal proceedings into the Davos incident. But Switzerland has been probing two alleged Russian agents for planning a cyber attack on the Spiez laboratory in Bern, which does analytical work for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). The lab at the time was investigating the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent. Swiss authorities also suspect Russia of being behind a cyber attack on the Lausanne office of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). WADA has been a thorn in Moscow's side for several years over drug cheating in Russian sport. The Montreal-based watchdog suspended Russia's Anti-Doping Agency in 2015 after declaring it to be non-compliant following evidence of a vast plan backed by Moscow to cheat at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. WADA has since imposed a four-year ban on Russia from major sporting events, which Moscow is appealing. – Rappler.com "

Screenshot from Rappler's Facebook Live BATANGAS, Philippines – It's been more than a week since people living in the cities and towns around Taal Lake fled their homes after Taal Volcano began erupting.

In evacuation centers, relief goods are still pouring in. But there's no telling how long the volcano will remain restive, and how long people will keep staying in basketball courts, school houses, and other places that are okay for now but will surely take a toll on their well-being if they end up staying longer.

186,249891,"January 22, 2020",Thought Leaders,[ANALYSIS] The economic lies in ‘Duterte Legacy’,JC Punongbayan,"Ranking officials of the Duterte government will do well to know a memorable quote in HBO’s Chernobyl: 'Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later that debt is paid'     The fake news never ends. In a surprising, gratuitous, and premature move, the Duterte government recently launched “Duterte Legacy” – an information drive that showcases the administration’s purported gains so far. The highlight of the launch, at least for me, is an infographic that features some statistics that supposedly paint a picture of progress in the past 3.5 years. The statistics cover areas like infrastructure, crime reduction, and economics. In this article I want to zero in on the economic statistics in Duterte Legacy. Not only are most of them dubious and misleading, but they also hide the Duterte administration’s policy blunders that tended to bring the country backward rather than forward. Inflation record Let’s start with the 0.8% inflation rate cited in Duterte Legacy, supposedly the “slowest pace since May 2016.” Inflation, as I have explained a number of times before, refers to the pace by which prices rise over time. Low inflation is generally good: it basically means you can buy more with the same income you have. Although an inflation of 0.8% sounds low, there are problems with this number as presented by the organizers of Duterte Legacy. First, it’s unclear how they arrived at it. The infographic claims to be updated as of January 9, 2020, but the last time inflation clocked in at 0.8% inflation was in November 2019. In December 2019 – the latest month with available data – inflation actually inched up to 2.5%. Second, and more to the point, 0.8% hides the fact that in 2018 we experienced some of the highest inflation rates in almost a decade (Figure 1). This was due to a number of factors – both domestic and international – but in large part attributable to the policies of the Duterte government.  Figure 1.  For instance, the 2017 TRAIN law hiked a number of excise taxes including those on petroleum products – at a time when world oil prices were soaring. The near-depletion of subsidized rice beginning in late 2017 – owing to delayed imports – also led to sky-high rice prices. Together, these ill-timed events – driven by ill-conceived policies by the Duterte government – stoked inflation and drove millions of Filipinos into needless hardship, according to a number of independent researchers. (READ: How the TRAIN law worsened poverty, inequality) Jobs record Duterte Legacy also claimed that Build, Build, Build (BBB), the government’s flagship economic project, generated nearly 4.2 million jobs. This statistic is implausible for a number of reasons. As of October 2019, there were 4.22 million people employed in the construction industry. Does Duterte Legacy mean to say BBB created nearly as many construction jobs as there currently are? At best we can say from the Labor Force Surveys there were 719,000 more construction jobs in October 2019 than in July 2016 when Duterte came into office. But this figure includes both public and private construction jobs, and the total is merely 17% of the net jobs created by BBB as boasted by Duterte Legacy. Duterte Legacy also touted a 4.5% unemployment rate, the “lowest since 2005.” In a previous piece, I did mention that last October it wasn’t just unemployment that reached an all-time low, but also underemployment (which comprises those with jobs but who want to earn more income or work more hours). Impressive as these rates are, they are more the continuation of a long-term decline that started more than a decade ago (Figure 2) – and hardly Duterte’s doing.  Figure 2.  I will concede that construction employment did pick up late last year. But you will remember that many BBB projects got stalled when Congress failed to pass the 2019 budget on time, mostly on account of politics. (READ: The pipe dream that is Build, Build, Build) In other words, the jobs record could be a lot better had it not been for the failings of Duterte’s friends in Congress. By the way, another infographic online, uploaded on the Duterte Legacy Facebook page, highlights instead the July 2018 unemployment rate of 5.4%, supposedly a record low. This is a baffling choice, one that betrays the sloppiness of the propagandists behind Duterte Legacy: the latest available unemployment data point last October 2019 is more recent and impressive at just 4.5%. Poverty record Finally, Duterte Legacy boldly claimed that 5.9 million Filipinos were “lifted out of poverty.” This comes from the latest poverty statistics published by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) last December. According to the PSA there were indeed nearly 6 million fewer poor Filipinos in 2018 than in 2015. The share of our poor population also dropped considerably over this period (Figure 3).  Figure 3.  But there’s a problem with how the statistic was framed. First, it’s a bit of a stretch to say that the Duterte administration was responsible for most of poverty reduction over that period, if at all. This is a perfect example of the “post hoc fallacy”: just because poverty reportedly dropped after Duterte came to office doesn’t mean he caused such poverty reduction. Second, poverty is going down likely due of a confluence of policies, both past and present. Most likely poverty reduction is finally catching up with higher growth trajectory our country has managed to achieve in the past two decades – a trend that started well before Duterte came to power. Third, Duterte Legacy hides the fact that some of Duterte’s policies have been unarguably anti-poor. There’s a new study, for instance, suggesting that the government’s bloody war on drugs could be effectively negating a number of key social protection and anti-poverty programs – most notably 4Ps or Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. Debt of lies We don’t have space here for other dubious claims in Duterte Legacy. But let’s not kid ourselves any further. Duterte’s real legacy – one that future generations will remember him for – is his war on drugs, which has, so far, killed at least 30,000 innocent victims, according to human rights groups. Next to that, perhaps Duterte’s other great legacy could be the extent by which his government perpetrated lies and disinformation at an unprecedented scale. During Duterte’s term, purveyors of fake news were appointed to plum government posts, and Duterte’s mouth itself has been a veritable fount of lies. Duterte Legacy is just the latest episode of this state-funded disinformation drive. Ranking officials of the Duterte government will do well to know a memorable quote in HBO’s “Chernobyl” shown last year: “Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later that debt is paid.” When will Duterte and his minions pay their mounting debt of lies? – Rappler.com  The author is a PhD candidate at the UP School of Economics.

The heavily redacted, previously top secret documents said the US Cyber Command ""successfully contested ISIS in the information domain"" and limited its online efforts on radicalization and recruitment ""by imposing time and resource costs"" on the jihadist group. The documents released by the National Security Archive at George Washington University offer the most detailed look at ""Operation Glowing Symphony,"" the first offensive hacking operation acknowledged by the Pentagon. The assessment pointed to a ""significant reduction"" in the online campaign waged by ISIS, but added that the Cyber Command efforts were slowed by a ""lengthy and difficult"" process for approving its operations. It said that, given the expectation of ""more frequent and widely scoped cyber operations,"" better procedures should be in place to ""help expedite the request and approval process."" Officials have previously acknowledged the use of offensive cyber weapons as part of the US arsenal, but the newly released documents offer the most detailed assessment of the moves against ISIS by a joint task force created in 2016 by president Barack Obama. According to a statement from the university archive, ""Glowing Symphony"" was initially approved for a 30-day window in late 2016 but a July 2017 administrative message extended the operation, and it was unclear if it is continuing. The documents released under a Freedom of Information Act request ""reveal the unprecedented complexity of the operation, resulting challenges in coordination and deconfliction, and assessments of effectiveness,"" the GWU archive said. The hacking operation represents the US response to concerns about how extremist groups had been using social media and online services to promote their cause, often seeking to spread propaganda for recruitment and radicalization. According to the university archive, the latest documents and public comments by Cyber Command chief General Paul Nakasone offer clues to how the joint task force operates and what it may do in response to efforts to disrupt the US election campaign. Nakasone said in a 2019 interview that another task force called the Russia Small Group had been formed  to be able to ""rapidly to address a threat"" to the campaign. – Rappler.com "

Hopefully, we can open also those under DepEd (elementary and secondary) by Monday,"" Mandanas said in a press conference Tuesday afternoon, January 21. He stressed that this is only applicable to classes in areas outside the Taal Volcano danger zone, while the rest will have to wait until the volcano's alert level is lowered. Taal Volcano has been under Alert Level 4 since January 12. ""Kapag Alert (Level) 4 pa rin, ang CHED outside 14 kilometers p'wede na pumasok. 'Yung lower hindi pa. After Sunday, titingnan natin kung p'wede na rin kahit (Alert) Level 4, basta outside [the] 14-kilometer radius,"" he added. (If it's still Alert Level 4, schools under CHED that are outside 14 kilometers can resume classes. Classes in lower levels can't resume yet. After Sunday, we will see if they can resume already despite the Alert Level 4, as long as they are outside the 14-kilometer radius.) Areas in Batangas that are within the 14-kilometer danger zone include Agoncillo, Alitagtag, Balete, Cuenca, Laurel, Lemery, Lipa City (especially lakeside areas), Malvar, Mataasnakahoy, San Jose, San Nicolas, Santa Teresita, Taal, Talisay, and Tanauan City. The governor said their target is to move evacuees out of all schools within a week and transfer them to other temporary shelters ""The province will be finishing already evacuation centers which will be able to have at least 15,000 persons who are now in school buildings,"" he said. Among the identified resettlement areas are the newly-built provincial rehabiitation and detention center in Barangay Malainin, Ibaan; and the 1,200-unit NHA housing project in Barangay Talaibon, also in Ibaan, built for police and soldiers. The housing project was never used because of some legal issues, but Mandanas said they have reached an agreement to temporarily utilize it as shelters for evacuees. Meanwhile, the governor stands firm on his decision not to implement window hours in areas under total lockdown. ""I believe that human life is more important than animal life and plant life,"" he stressed. He also announced that the provincial government is committed to buy animals from areas under total lockdown should their owners want to sell them so they can stop worrying about feeding them. According to Mandanas, the number of evacuees from the province reached the one-million mark as of Tuesday. Of this number, 200,000 are staying in evacuation centers across Calabarzon, while the rest or 800,000 are staying outside evacuation centers. Mandanas said the province is now allocating a budget of P150 per evacuee per day or P150 million per day to cover the food and sanitation needs of all evacuees. The governor remains optimistic as aid and assistance continue to pour into the province. ""Kakayanin natin ito dahil mayroon naman tayong sapat na (We will get through this because we have enough) calamity fund, bukod pa sa (aside from the) assistance from the national government, from companies and private individuals, foreign groups, and other neighboring local government units,"" he said. The provincial government of Batangas, which is under a state of calamity, has a calamity fund of P200 million and a regular budget that was doubled this year to over P8 billion. President Rodrigo Duterte earlier also asked Congress to pass a P30-billion ""supplemental budget"" to provide aid for those affected by the ongoing eruption. – Rappler.com "
189,249894,"January 22, 2020",US & Canada,Trump trial opens with clash over witnesses,Agence France-Presse,"Flexing his solid 53-47 majority, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell makes clear he would summarily block any Democratic attempts to change his rules  TRIAL OPENS. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) (C) heads toward the Senate Chamber before the start of President Donald Trump's impeachment trial at the U.S. Capitol January 21, 2020, in Washington, DC. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFP WASHINGTON DC, USA – The historic impeachment trial of US President Donald Trump opened with fireworks Tuesday, January 21, as Democrats angrily accused Senate Republicans of seeking a ""cover-up"" without witnesses or new evidence. With the US leader facing potential removal from office for abuse of power, his close ally Mitch McConnell laid out ground rules that would block subpoenaing key witnesses or documents while each side makes its case – potentially crippling prosecutors' arguments. Flexing his solid 53-47 majority, the Republican Senate leader also made clear he would summarily block any Democratic attempts to change his rules. ""The basic structure we're proposing is just as eminently fair and even-handed,"" McConnell said. Adam Schiff, the leader of the House impeachment managers prosecuting Trump, countered that the process ""makes no sense"" for a trial, and was designed instead to ensure evidence is never heard and Trump is exculpated. McConnell's rules aim to make the case ""go away as quickly as possible to cover up his misdeeds,"" Schiff said in his opening presentation on the Senate floor. ""It's completely backwards, trial before evidence,"" he said. ""Most Americans don't believe there will be a fair trial."" Witness subpoenas Trump was impeached on December 18 by the House of Representatives, and formally charged on the floor of the Senate last week with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It is only the third time a US president has endured an impeachment trial, after Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868. Like his two predecessors, Trump looks almost certain to be acquitted by the Senate Republican majority in a trial that could be as short as two weeks. Showing some compromise, McConnell's initial draft was modified at the last minute, allowing 24 hours of arguments by each side stretched over 3 days rather than the two-day, 12 hours a day schedule originally outlined. Republicans also appeared ready to remove a block on the House managers presenting the evidence from their original investigation to the Senate at the beginning of the trial, rather than only after arguments have been made. But there was no suggestion that McConnell would bend on Democrat demands that witness subpoenas be allowed from the outset. Democrats want to hear from 4 current and former top Trump aides, including White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security advisor John Bolton, who have direct knowledge of the accusations against the president. During the House investigation Trump claimed executive privilege and blocked their testimony, as well as the release of documents subpoenaed by the House. Ukraine scandal The articles of impeachment state that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 election to help him win, and then to thwart the investigation by blocking witnesses and denying documents to the House of Representatives. Central to the scandal is a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, his potential opponent in the November vote. Trump is accused of withholding nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine's war against Russian-backed separatists, and refusing Zelensky a White House meeting, unless he opened a probe of Biden. On Sunday, January 19, Trump's legal team issued a 110-page defense which claimed the House has accused him of no specific ""crime,"" that their investigation was a ""rigged process,"" and that Trump was within his rights to push Ukraine to investigate Biden. Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's lawyers, told the Senate Tuesday that the two articles of impeachment have only ""a vague allegation about a non-crime allegation of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress."" 'Witch hunt' The impeachment process is deeply divisive among Americans – with polls showing the country split down the middle on whether the president should be removed from office, 10 months before voters go to the polls to decide whether to re-elect him. The president himself was in Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, where he repeated his longstanding characterization of impeachment as a ""hoax."" In Davos, Trump said, ""we're meeting with world leaders, the most important people in the world and we're bringing back tremendous business."" ""The other's just a hoax,"" he said. ""It's the witch hunt that's been going on for years and frankly it's disgraceful."" – Rappler.com "

Markets are down slightly in morning trading as investors weigh concerns over a virus outbreak in China and continued trade concerns between the US and China. Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images/AFP WASHINGTON DC, USA – US health authorities on Tuesday, January 21, announced the first case of a person on American soil sickened by a new virus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and intensified airport health screenings. The man, a US resident in his 30s who lives near Seattle, is in good condition, according to federal and state officials. The man is being ""hospitalized out of an abundance of precaution, and for short term monitoring, not because there was severe illness,"" said Chris Spitters, a Washington state health official. The news came as Asian countries ramped up measures to block the spread of the new virus as the death toll in China rose to 6 and the number of cases surpassed 300. China is about to embark on the Lunar New Year holiday – a huge travel time for hundreds of millions of people. The man hospitalized in Washington state had traveled to the US from Wuhan, but did not visit the seafood market thought to be at the heart of the outbreak. He entered the US on January 15 – two days before health screenings for those traveling from Wuhan began at airports in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco – and approached health authorities himself after reading news reports about the virus. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will now be deployed to two additional international airports, in Chicago and Atlanta. All travelers on flights from Wuhan, either direct or connecting, will now be re-routed to the 5 airports with screening systems in place. Nations across the Asia-Pacific region stepped up checks of passengers at airports to detect the SARS-like coronavirus. Fears of a bigger outbreak rose after a prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed late Monday, January 20, that the virus can be passed between people. – Rappler.com "

A handout picture provided by the Lebanese photo agency Dalati and Nohra on on January 21, 2020, shows Lebanon's new Prime Minister Hassan Diab signing official documents at the presidential palace in Baabda, east of the capital Beirut, as the new government is announced. AFP PHOTO/HO/DALATI AND NOHRA BEIRUT, Lebanon – Lebanon ended a painful wait Tuesday, January 21, by unveiling a new cabinet line-up, but the government was promptly scorned by protesters and faces the Herculean task of saving a collapsing economy. More than a month after he was designated with backing from the powerful Shiite movement Hezbollah and nearly 3 after his predecessor Saad Hariri resigned under pressure from the street, Prime Minister Hassan Diab's cabinet of 20 ministers was announced. The academic and former education minister, who was little-known in Lebanon until last month, insisted in his first comments as premier that his cabinet was a technocratic one that would strive to meet protesters' demands. ""This is a government that represents the aspirations of the demonstrators who have been mobilized nationwide for more than 3 months,"" he said. He said his government ""will strive to meet their demands for an independent judiciary, for the recovery of embezzled funds, for the fight against illegal gains."" The new cabinet is made up of little-known figures, many of them academics and former advisers, but protesters were quick to argue that the absence of the biggest names in Lebanon's widely reviled hereditary political elite was but a smokescreen. Groups of demonstrators had gathered in the streets of Beirut before the cabinet was even unveiled, blocking off a main street in the center of the capital where violent scuffles with the police left dozens wounded over the weekend. 'Not serious' ""We want a new Lebanon, a Lebanon with no corruption,"" Charbel Kahi, a 37-year-old farmer, told Agence France-Presse as fellow protesters beat drums behind him. ""They are not taking the Lebanese people seriously with this government,"" he said. Hilal Khashan, a professor at the American University of Beirut, argued that the idea of a genuinely technocratic government in Lebanon was ""wishful thinking."" ""Behind every candidate, there is a political party backing their nomination,"" he said. Paula Yacoubian, a former journalist and independent MP, scorned the new line-up as ""patches on old clothes."" She posted a picture of a beat-up car with flaking paint the caption: ""There's a disagreement over who will be driving (and) who will have a seat by the window."" ""Hassan Diab did not keep his promise of forming a government of independent"" experts, she said. Diab, a 61-year-old engineering professor at the American University of Beirut and self-professed technocrat, had been stuck between a political rock and an economic hard place. Every day that passed without a cabinet had fuelled the anger of protesters and tested the patience of foreign donors warning that the quasi-bankrupt state could ill afford further delays. Mission impossible? Donors and citizens are pinning their hopes on a new government to spearhead reforms, unlock billions in international aid and help stabilize a plummeting currency. But analysts argue that there is little Hassan Diab's new government can do. ""The task that awaits any cabinet during this serious period is Herculean,"" said Karim Mufti, a political scientist. ""In view of the multidimensional nature of the crisis, it seems difficult to envisage short-term solutions to the country's financial, economic and social problems."" A grinding dollar liquidity crisis and informal caps on withdrawals of the greenback have compounded the crisis, leaving Lebanon on the brink of default. The outgoing government included all of Lebanon's political factions, but Hariri's Sunni-dominated movement and some of his allies have opted to stay out of the new cabinet. This leaves the small country of 6 million led by a government dominated by the sanctions-hit Hezbollah movement and its allies. Both the Christian bloc of President Michel Aoun and the Shiite Amal party of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri are political allies of the Iran-backed organization. Observers have warned that such a lopsided government could struggle to foster enough goodwill at home and abroad to implement much-needed reforms. – Rappler.com "

An arrangement of UK daily newspapers photographed as an illustration in London on January 9, 2020, shows front page headlines reporting on the news that Britain's Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, plan to step back as ""senior"" members of the Royal Family. Photo by Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP VICTORIA, Canada – Prince Harry and his wife Meghan started their new life in Canada on Tuesday, January 21 by launching a legal warning to media over photographs of the duchess near their seaside bolthole. Following their shock exit from life as working royals, Harry jetted out from Britain to join Meghan late Monday at a luxury house outside Victoria on Vancouver Island. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have temporarily set up base at the wooded home, having spent six weeks there over Christmas with their baby son Archie. Their bombshell announcement on January 8 that they wished to step back from their royal duties rocked the monarchy. The couple, who married in May 2018, admitted last year that they were struggling with media scrutiny and have regularly hit out at the press in statements and in the courts. Their lawyers issued a legal warning after various outlets on Tuesday published photographs of a smiling Meghan out walking her dogs with Archie. In Britain, the pictures were used by The Sun and the Daily Mail newspapers. Lawyers claimed the images were taken by photographers hiding in bushes and spying on the US former television actress, the BBC reported. They say she did not consent and accuse the photographers of harassment, the BBC added, while the couple were prepared to take legal action. The lawyers claim there had been attempts to photograph inside their new home using long lenses, and say paparazzi are camped outside the property. 'No other option' Harry, 35, and 38-year-old Meghan are bowing out entirely from representing the monarchy, in a crisis that has shaken the centuries-old institution. Harry said Sunday that they did not want to quit their royal duties but reluctantly accepted there was ""no other option"" if they wanted to cut loose from public funding and seek their own income in pursuit of a more independent life. Under their new arrangement, the Sussexes are free to earn their own commercial income – though at a greater cost than they first envisaged. They can no longer represent Harry's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II or be referred to as their royal highnesses, and must repay taxpayers' money spent on their UK home. They will no longer receive public money – though 95% of their annual funding comes from his father Prince Charles, via the heir to the throne's hereditary land and property estate. To what extent that will continue, and who will cover their security bill – currently met by the British police – remains to be seen. Questions over funding Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday denied having spoken ""directly"" with Queen Elizabeth about the security costs, after British media reports that the country had offered to foot the bill. ""Discussions continue to be ongoing and I have no updates at this moment,"" Trudeau told a news conference. Canadian media have estimated the cost of protecting the couple and their eight-month-old son Archie at about Can$1.7 million (US$1.3 million) a year. Other estimates run higher. Britain's Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said there must be a ""line of delineation"" over who pays the security costs. Asked whether British taxpayers should fund the Sussexes while they are in Canada, he told Sky News television: ""I don't have an easy answer to that."" The couple intend to raise their own income streams. They have launched their new Sussex Royal website and trademarked the name. However, the queen's senior advisor on heraldry suggested they should not be allowed to use the royal moniker, having relinquished their public duties. ""I don't think it's satisfactory. One cannot be two things at once. You either are (royal) or you're not,"" Thomas Woodcock, the Garter King of Arms, told The Times newspaper. In a role that dates back to the 15th century, he is involved in making sure that royal symbols are not used illegitimately for commercial purposes. Woodcock, who was giving his personal opinion, said the final decision would rest with the sovereign. 'Leave them in peace' Like Britain, Canada is a Commonwealth realm, meaning Queen Elizabeth is the head of state. Residents walking dogs on a path near the Sussexes' new home told AFP that they opposed intrusion into their new Canadian set-up, and were proud of the local instinct to give them space. ""We don't like it. Leave them in peace,"" said Anne Girling, adding she had met Meghan jogging on a trail nearby and they wished one another ""good morning."" Sue Starkey, another dog walker, described the area as a ""really friendly"" community. ""Our neighborhood has been so respectful and giving them space,"" she said. ""I'm really happy they're here and I hope they can find some peace."" – Rappler.com "

The aid was found abandoned in warehouses in the US territory over the weekend, leading to protests and a judicial investigation. On Monday, 10 of the towns most affected by the series of tremors received nearly 900 boxes of diapers, almost 1,400 cots, about 880 tarps and hundreds of boxes of batteries, gas stoves and bed sheets, among other items, Puerto Rico National Guard chief Jose Reyes said. ""The mission continues today,"" Reyes said, ""and the supplies will also be sent to other areas"" as a preventative measure. About 5,000 people are living in open-air shelters, nervous after the more than 1,000 earthquakes that have struck the southern part of the island since December 28 and which have left hundreds of homes uninhabitable. Residents were irate when two warehouses – one in the southern city of Ponce and another near San Juan – were found to be filled with thousands of abandoned supplies, apparently never used after Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The storms' one-two punch left Puerto Ricans without power for months and killed nearly 3,000 people, according to the local government's official numbers. ""It is totally unacceptable what has happened,"" Secretary of Public Affairs Osvaldo Soto told journalists after the government on Tuesday made public an inventory of the warehouses. A Facebook user had on Saturday posted video of one of the facilities filled with undistributed aid. Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced fired three high-ranking officials and referred the case to the courts. On Monday, hundreds called for Vazquez Garced's resignation during a protest in the capital of San Juan, where street demonstrations forced the resignation of her predecessor only 6 months ago. US President Donald Trump has accused the Puerto Rican government of incompetence and siphoning off hurricane relief money, triggering a public spat between the president and San Juan's Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, as well as the governor Ricardo Rossello.

Photo by Mark Goodnow/AFP) VANCOUVER, Canada – Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan have eschewed many of the trappings of a royal life in London for what the Duke of Sussex says he hopes will be a ""more peaceful life"" in Canada. For now, at least, they will live in North Saanich, on the southern end of Vancouver Island – literally half a world away from the bustle of London's affluent Kensington district that Harry once called home. Harry, a fan of powerful English football team Arsenal, may have to cheer for the Vancouver Whitecaps if he wants to watch the beautiful game – or embrace Canada's national sport, ice hockey. As for their new home, the community of North Saanich is described on its official website as a ""highly desirable rural-residential area"" with a ""rich agricultural interior"" – not exactly Kensington's High Street. The following is a look at how life may look for Harry, Meghan and their infant son Archie – at least in the short term before they buy a permanent residence: Community living North Saanich – where the couple is currently staying at the Mille Fleurs waterfront estate – was home to a little more than 12,000 people in 2018, according to Canadian government census data. That's about a third of the population of Windsor, where Harry and Meghan most recently lived in Frogmore Cottage, and a tiny fraction of the number of people in London or Toronto, where Meghan lived for years while working on the television show ""Suits."" The couple constantly makes headlines in the Daily Mail, other British tabloids – and around the world. The local paper, the Peninsula News Review, also featured Harry and Meghan as its top story Tuesday – but featured as well on the website's front page was the tale of a local woman who went viral for dressing as a dinosaur. And the North Saanich district website offers local news about food drives, recycling, and charity fundraisers. A pamphlet for new residents of the Canadian seaside community, available online, offers details about local transportation, tree cutting – and licenses the couple will need for Meghan's dogs. The Duchess of Sussex was seen hiking with Archie in Horth Hill Regional Park. Ciao London, hello Vancouver It appears that Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, are looking for a quieter life, but they will surely need a dose of city living from time to time, which they can easily find in Vancouver. While Harry was hammering out the details of their withdrawal from royal life, Meghan was visiting two women's charities in the bustling Pacific coast port city, a ferry or helicopter ride away. Vancouver has a variety of nicknames, including Hollywood North – it is home to numerous TV and film sets – and No Fun City, an in-joke about its perceived lameness. Harry may miss watching his beloved Arsenal, but Vancouver boasts its own football team – the Whitecaps, which are part of US-based Major League Soccer. Of course, there are the Canucks, the city's beloved hockey team. Or the BC Lions, which play in the Canadian Football League – similar to American football, with slightly different rules. As far as shopping goes, farmers' markets and roadside produce stands in North Saanich may replace the luxury of Harrods for the time being. Vancouver is a foodie haven, but the couple might have trouble slipping into a local pub for a bite. Even in North Saanich, one restaurant owner turned them down due to the security needed.

Photo by Franz Lopez/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The level of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission from Taal Volcano in Batangas was lower for the second day, but state volcanologists said a longer trend or pattern must be observed first. SO2 is a major gas component of magma, and its emission indicates that magma is already at a shallow part of the volcano. In a briefing on Wednesday morning, January 22, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said SO2 emission was measured at an average of 153 tons per day. The measurement given on Tuesday morning, January 21, had been 344 tons per day. Previous measurements in past days had reached over 4,000 tons per day. ""Hindi porque bumaba ang SO2 ay safe na tayo, dahil puwedeng nababarahan lamang ang mga labasan ng SO2.... So maraming puwedeng maging factors. Kailangan natin makita 'yung dire-diretsong trend na pababa,"" said Maria Antonia Bornas, chief of the Phivolcs Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division, in Wednesday's press briefing. (Just because SO2 went down doesn't mean we're already safe, because it's possible that the vents where SO2 could be released from are just blocked. So there are many possible factors. We need to see a continuous trend that the emission level is going down.) Taal is still under Alert Level 4, which means there could be a hazardous eruption ""within hours to days."" In Phivolcs' 8 am bulletin, it said ""activity in the main crater in the past 24 hours has been characterized by weak emission of white steam-laden plumes 50 to 500 meters high."" Later at 4 pm, it issued an update saying that there have been no ash emissions since 5 am that morning, based on seismic records and visual observations. But ash blanketing Taal Volcano Island, said Phivolcs, was ""remobilized and transported by strong low-level winds"" to the towns of Lemery and Agoncillo. ""Reports from several airlines state the presence of remobilized volcanic ash at a height of approximately 5,800 meters (19,000 feet),"" added Phivolcs. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far) Volcanic earthquakes The ""intense"" seismic activity, referring to volcanic earthquakes, also continues. Phivolcs is using two networks to monitor volcanic earthquakes – the Philippine Seismic Network which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former. The Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 725 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12, when the Taal unrest began. Of these, 176 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. From 5 am on Tuesday until 6 am on Wednesday, there were 6 volcanic earthquakes plotted at magnitudes 1.5 to 2.4, with no felt event. The Taal Volcano Network, meanwhile, recorded 481 volcanic earthquakes – including 8 low-frequency earthquakes – just in the past 24 hours. According to the United States Geological Survey, low-frequency earthquakes ""are caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface."" Still threatening Phivolcs stressed that there must be ""total evacuation"" of Taal Volcano Island as well as high-risk areas within a 14-kilometer radius from the main crater and ""along the Pansipit River Valley where fissuring has been observed."" (WATCH: Fishermen risk lives for catch around restive Taal Volcano) Fissures or cracks had appeared in parts of Batangas province, particularly in the towns of Lemery, Agoncillo, Talisay, and San Nicolas, which are all high-risk areas.

(READ: TIMELINE: Taal Volcano eruptions since 1572) But the status might be downgraded to Alert Level 3 – that is, if all parameters being monitored by Phivolcs go down for an extended period of time. ""Kung patuloy po ang downtrend ng mga monitoring parameters, ibababa po naman natin ang alert level matapos masiguro na ang probabilities for an eruption ay mababa na,"" Bornas said. (If the downtrend in the monitoring parameters continues, we would downgrade the alert level once we make sure that the probabilities for an eruption are already low.) Note, however, that Alert Level 3 would still mean a hazardous eruption is possible ""within days to weeks."" The long, uncertain wait is taking its toll on displaced residents. There are 39,052 families or 148,987 persons in evacuation centers, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.

Without warning a 7.3-magnitude earthquake rips through Tokyo Bay, the ground shakes violently causing citywide damage, widespread panic, and multiple casualties. Fortunately, this is just an imagined scenario at a disaster drill carried out just before Christmas, as Tokyo 2020 organizers prepare for the worst, while hoping they will never have to do it for real. (READ: Final countdown: Tokyo marks one year till 2020 Olympics) At the gymnastics venue in Tokyo Bay the public address springs into action in Japanese and English. ""There has been an earthquake.

The elevators may not be used."" Emergency first aid Within minutes, blue uniformed officers from the Tokyo fire department in their white helmets stream into the stadium. ""Are you OK?"" emergency first responders shout as they tend to bodies littering the stands. Officials urge calm via loudspeakers and console elderly spectators. Fifteen minutes later, troops from the Japanese self-defence forces in military uniform burst into the venue and are briefed on the situation as the evacuation gathers pace. Troops bring in white stretchers and carry the injured to a triage area hastily set up adjacent to the gymnastics mats. Medics perform emergency first aid on people laid out on red blankets as commanders bark out orders in a fevered but efficient atmosphere, sending less urgent cases to another venue. Dozens of spectators, including the walking wounded and those in wheelchairs, are evacuated through the wide boulevards of the Tokyo Bay area, but efforts are hampered by a 6.0-magnitude aftershock at 10:30 am. Across town, at the imposing Tokyo Metropolitan Government building, city governor Yuriko Koike convenes an emergency gathering with 40 of her top officials from the city authorities, fire department, coastguard, and self-defense forces. She receives a briefing on the evolving situation in her quake-hit city, with a dozen monitors showing still images of the damage at the gymnastics venue and the location of fires burning around Tokyo. Koike orders that all resources be diverted to saving lives but that infrastructure such as port and river facilities must also be inspected and repaired if necessary. ""We have many guests domestically and from abroad for the Tokyo 2020 Games,"" she says, wrapping up the meeting. ""Please exert your utmost efforts to ensure the safety of spectators and Games workers as much as you do for Tokyo residents,"" she orders. The large-scale drill, over two locations and involving more than 500 volunteers, is part of Tokyo 2020's contingency planning as they gear up to host the Games in one of the world's most seismically active countries. Typhoons and terror Sports fans already had a taste of Japan's vulnerability to natural disasters when a powerful typhoon struck during the Rugby World Cup, forcing the unprecedented cancellation of three matches. Tokyo firefighters included an anti-terrorism drill alongside emergency preparations in their traditional new year display. While visitors from around the world may be unnerved by earthquakes, officials stress there is no country better prepared or equipped. Japan experiences thousands of tremors per year of varying sizes and the vast majority cause little or no damage, with emergency services well drilled. Paralympic boss Andrew Parsons recalled in a recent AFP interview being in a Tokyo hotel when a medium-sized earthquake shook his room and he rushed to reception in a mild panic.

This file photo taken on January 18, 2020 shows medical staff members carrying a patient into the Jinyintan hospital, where patients infected by a mysterious SARS-like virus are being treated, in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province. Photo by STR/AFP BEIJING, China (4th UPDATE) –  The death toll from a new SARS-like virus that has infected hundreds in China rose to 17 on Wednesday, January 22, as authorities urged people to steer clear of the city at the centre of the outbreak. The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. With hundreds of millions of people travelling across China this week for the Lunar New Year holiday, the National Health Commission announced measures to contain the disease – including sterilization and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains. In Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic, large public events were cancelled and international football matches were moved to a new location. Visitors were urged to stay away, while residents were advised to not to leave the central city, which is home to 11 million people. ""If it's not necessary we suggest that people don't come to Wuhan,"" Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV. The illness is mainly transmitted via the respiratory tract and there ""is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease,"" health commission vice minister Li Bin told a news conference in Beijing.  (READ: U.S. confirms 1st case of China virus on American soil) More than 500 cases have now been reported, with the majority in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. The virus has now infected at least 444 people in Hubei province alone, said provincial officials at a press conference, adding that the death toll had risen from nine to 17. Major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing have also reported cases, as well as provinces in northeastern, central, and southern China. The World Health Organization started an emergency meeting Wednesday to decide whether or not to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has now been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Macau. (READ: U.S. confirms 1st case of China virus on American soil) The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures. But they still have not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus. ""We will step up research efforts to identify the source and transmission of the disease,"" Li said, adding that ""the cases are mostly linked to Wuhan"". Countries have intensified efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen – known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Passengers are facing screening measures at five US airports and a host of transport hubs across Asia. Britain and Italy on Wednesday also announced enhanced monitoring of passengers from Wuhan. Virus source A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak. A Wuhan market is believed to be the epicenter of the outbreak. A price list circulating online in China for a business there lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies and rats. It also offered civets, the animal linked to SARS. ""We already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals,"" said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention. He said it was clear ""this virus is adapting and mutating"". Hong Kong and British scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in Wuhan may have been infected. Containment Health authorities are urging people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air and wear a mask if they have a cough. Anyone with a cough or fever was urged to go to hospital. In Wuhan, city authorities made it mandatory to wear a mask in public places on Wednesday, according to state-run People's Daily. In response to skyrocketing demand for masks – which were starting to sell out at pharmacies and on some popular websites – China's industry and information technology ministry said it would ""spare no effort in increasing supply"", state media reported. ""These days, I wear masks even in places that are not too crowded, although I wouldn't have done so in the past,"" said Wang Suping, 50, who works at a Beijing arts school. At the capital's main international airport, the majority of people were wearing masks. Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific said it had agreed to allow staff to wear surgical masks on mainland China flights, and that passengers from Wuhan would be offered masks and antiseptic wipes. In Wuhan, police were conducting vehicle spot checks for live poultry or wild animals leaving and entering the city, state media said. Officials also screened people on roads, the airport and the train station for fever. The local government has cancelled major public activities and banned tour groups from heading out of the city.

The overseeing technical working group allows each motorcycle taxi firm to have up to 21,000 bikers, from an initial cap of 13,000. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – After facing a couple of temporary restraining orders (TRO) against the controversial biker cap of the motorcycle taxi pilot run, the overseeing technical working group (TWG) has now agreed to raise the cap from 13,000 to 21,000 per provider. In an interview on ANC's Early Edition, TWG chair Antonio Gardiola Jr revealed that concessions were agreed upon on the part of the motorcycle taxi providers – Angkas, JoyRide, and Move It – as well as the TWG. What's the agreement? The biker cap would be raised, but all cases against the TWG's guidelines will be dropped. ""We agree that all cases filed against the technical working group will be withdrawn. They agreed on that. And during the period of the study, no cases will be filed constraining the TWG on some aspects, especially the guidelines,"" Gardiola said. Angkas earlier filed a petition for a TRO against the guidelines of the pilot run, in particular against the biker cap, which would have forced the firm to slash up to 17,000 of its bikers. It also filed a petition to exclude JoyRide and MoveIt from participating in the pilot run. After the House committee on transportation hearing on Wednesday, January 22, Angkas chief transport advocate George Royeca confirmed that the cases would be dropped. ""The cases [were filed] to put in a grievance on one of the provisions and we already spoke about it, and that's what it's for; it's not really for anything else. So we are now in a spirit of collaboration,"" Royeca said in a mix of English and Filipino. The initial biker cap per motorcycle taxi firm was 10,000 bikers in Metro Manila and 3,000  in Metro Cebu. The new cap allows each motorcycle taxi firm to have up to 15,000 bikers in Metro Manila, 3,000 in Metro Cebu, and 3,000 in Cagayan de Oro. Gardiola said the TWG recognized the need in other urban areas so Cagayan de Oro was added as a new area for the pilot run. Angkas units were earlier apprehended in Cagayan de Oro for operating outside the areas allowed by the pilot run. Asked what would happen to these units, Gardiola said it would be up to the court. What if the firms fail to reach the cap? As earlier stated, biker slots that are not filled by a motorcycle taxi provider may be redistributed to the firm that has reached the limit. At the moment, Angkas already registered 10,000 bikers in Metro Manila, the maximum under the initial cap. ""Kung hindi kaya ng isang player to come up with that number of riders, ibibigay po 'yun doon sa company na ready and [that has] that number of riders, which is right now, we can say it's Angkas,"" Gardiola said. (If one player cannot come up with that number of riders, the slots will be given to the company that already has that number of riders, which is right now, we can say it's Angkas.) According to Gardiola, Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade already asked JoyRide and MoveIt if they would be amenable to this provision, and that the two companied  had no objections. The TWG and the providers have yet discuss when biker registration would end to allow for the redistribution of slots. – Rappler.com  "

Photo by KD Madrilejos/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said much is still unknown regarding the novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV, allaying fears that the new virus that has caused illness in China is certainly as threatening as the viruses that caused SARS and MERS epidemics years ago. The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday, January 21, announced that it was investigating a case of “non-specific pancoronavirus” found in a 5-year-old child who traveled from Wuhan, China – the center of the outbreak – to Cebu City. This means that the child could be afflicted with the 2019 nCoV or any of the 4 other existing coronaviruses that can infect humans. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) Coronaviruses are known to cause a wide range of conditions from the common cold to the more severe SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle Easy respiratory syndrome). Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, January 22, Duque said there are “still many blindspots on the novel coronavirus” and that the DOH is in constant communication with the World Health Organization (WHO) for definitive updates regarding the virus. Duque said being infected with a coronavirus is not “an automatic death sentence” as there are coronaviruses that cause the common cold. He added that the 5-year-old child in Cebu City is recovering, still with coughs but no longer feverish. But he added that the DOH is waiting for test results from the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia before it can rule out that the coronavirus found in the child is 2019 nCoV. They expect results to come out Thursday, January 23. The Chinese government on Wednesday warned that the disease may spread as the death toll hit 9 and the number of cases reached 440 across China. Cases have also been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Chinese officials have also said that the virus may be spread through human-to-human contact, though the WHO has yet to make a similar pronouncement. “Generally, coronaviruses spread via aerial droplets…through sneezing and coughing. That’s why personal hygiene, cough etiquette are very important, they will certainly reduce the chances of transmission,” Duque said. He also said illnesses caused by coronaviruses are “self-limiting” and that recovery may be quick given effective supportive treatment. The key is to strengthen the immune system, Duque said. The WHO will convene an emergency committee on Wednesday to discuss the novel virus to determine whether the recent outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. The committee is also expected to come up with recommendations for management of the disease. – Rappler.com "

Four dissenters, led by Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, wanted to strike down the ordinance as unconstitutional for being too overbroad, and which might restrain free speech. Manila Public Information Chief Julius Leonen confirmed to Rappler that the measure, Ordinance No. 7780, is still in effect. (READ: Artists, musicians raise funds to free activists who spray-painted LRT posts) What's the case? FHM – a glossy men's magazine that stopped print operations in 2018 – filed the petition before the Supreme Court in 2008 as an offshoot of being prosecuted under the ordinance. A group of pastors and preachers, led by then Manila 6th District Representative and now House Minority Leader Bienvenido Abante filed a complaint against FHM and other publications, particularly tabloids, for violating Ordinance No. 7780 or Manila's Anti-Obscenity measure. Note that Abante was the principal author of the ordinance. Abante's group also sued the publications for violating Articles 200 (grave scandal) and 201 (obscene publications) of the Revised Penal Code. Manila's City Prosecutor Office dismissed the complaints for violating the ordinance and Article 200. The case that prospered in the lower court is for violation of Article 201(3) which punishes ""those who shall sell, give away or exhibit films, prints, engravings, sculpture or literature which are offensive to morals."" The Jardeleza ponencia dismissed the petition as moot because Manila prosecutors didn't push through with the case related to the ordinance. The majority justices said: ""Until the proper case presents itself, prudence dictates that the Court should exercise judicial restraint."" Jardeleza got concurrences from Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta, Associate Justices Benjamin Caguioa, Andres Reyes Jr, Jose Reyes Jr, Ramon Paul Hernando, Amy Lazaro-Javier, Henri Inting and Rodil Zalameda. What did dissenters say? Associate Justice Marvic Leonen said that the Court should have tackled the constitutionality of the ordinance because it might be used to prosecute free speech again in the future. ""The dismissal of the criminal cases against petitioners does not mean that no other person will be penalized under the Ordinance. Its constitutionality, therefore, is an issue that is precisely 'capabale of repetition, yet evading review',"" said Leonen. Another dissenter Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas Bernabe said the ordinance must be struck down for being overbroad. ""It violates substantive due process under an overbreadth analysis, which is one of the known methods of reviewing the constitutionality of an ordinance or a law,"" said Bernabe. The Jardeleza ponencia also argued that because obscenity is unprotected speech, then it is not a free speech issue. But Bernabe and Leonen argued that the language of the ordinance was too broad that it may infringe on free speech. ""A statute that is broadly written which deters free expression can be struck down on its face because of its chilling effect even if it also prohibits acts that may legitimately be forbidden,"" said Bernabe. Leonen said the ordinance did not take into account that the modern audience has a different standard of what is obscene, noting that FHM's readers were 40% female. ""As it stands, Ordinance no. 7780 is a feeble attempt to legislate morality. It prevents adults, who have complete autonomy over their morals and choices, from pursuing what may be their own personal interests,"" said Leonen. Retired senior associate justice Antonio Carpio and Associate Justice Rosmari Carandang adopted Leonen's dissent. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Lisa Marie David/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – There are several proposals to help the survivors of the Taal Volcano eruption. Many residents living within the 14-kilometer danger zone surrounding the restive volcano are uncertain as to when they can go back to their normal lives. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far) Some of them are at evacuation centers in nearby cities, while others have chosen to stay with their relatives. At least 11 towns are placed under total lockdown, and residents were no longer allowed to go back to these areas until further notice. Currently, Alert Level 4 is raised over Taal Volcano. State volcanologists say that a major explosion may come within hours, days, or even months. Here are some proposals on how to help the survivors in the short-term: P30,000 cash aid Senator Risa Hontiveros urged the Department of Social Welfare and Development to give at least P30,000 cash assistance to Taal Volcano eruption survivors, as President Rodrigo Duterte planned to seek P30 billion worth of supplemental budget from Congress for rehabilitation. Hontiveros said that this should be in the form of cash aid and not a loan, as the evacuees' lives were temporarily halted because of the eruption. Hontiveros acknowledged that the amount may not be enough to fully recuperate from the disaster. She said this should be regareded as an ""initial assistance,"" pending the post-disaster assessment by the government. Loan amortization moratorium Senator Sherwin Gatchalian is pushing for a one-year moratorium on loan amortization for residents affected by the Taal Volcano eruption. Gatchalian filed Senate Resolution No. 289 urging government financial institutions (GSIS, SSS, Pagibig) to extend loans to the victims and to freeze mandatory amortization payments within a year. Suspend penalties on late tax payments to LGUs Gatchalian also urged local governments to temporarily suspend imposition of penalties on the victims. He said that LGUs should be ""more lenient"" on payment of real estate property taxes, as well as the renewal of business permits. Business permit renewals are usually done between January 1 and 20 every year. – Rappler.com "

216,249925,"January 22, 2020",Philippines,WATCH: Anxious villagers plead against lockdown of areas near Taal Volcano,JC Gotinga,"Residents of lakeside villages in Tanauan City, Batangas, are pleading to be allowed to visit their homes, after the government completely closed off the immediate danger zone around Taal Volcano   BATANGAS, Philippines – Anxious residents of Barangay Janopol Occidental in Tanauan City, Batangas, pleaded with police and soldiers at a checkpoint going into their village on Wednesday morning, January 22. They were asking for a reprieve from a total lockdown that they said caught them by surprise. Whereas they used to be able to enter the village and return home for 3 hours each morning and afternoon ever since Taal Volcano started erupting on January 12, a new order from city hall completely bars them from going back in. Alert Level 4 remains over the volcano, which means a hazardous eruption can happen at any moment. In that case, a deadly, devastating base surge from the crater could reach the cities and towns surrounding Taal Lake. The lockdown of lakeside parts of Batangas and neighboring Cavite province is meant to protect villagers from this eventuality. For many villagers, however, the more pressing concern is to secure their homes, belongings, and livestock that they left behind. When Jonathan Mirafuentes arrived on his motorcycle at the checkpoint, he was visibly upset. He had just come from his graveyard shift as a security guard at an establishment on Mount Makiling in neighboring Laguna province, and he couldn't understand why he wasn't allowed to check on his house. ""My stuff in the house are gone. The TV is gone. Our door was broken into. The padlock is gone. It was chained. My wife went home yesterday, see. I've just come from work. I was on duty. I guard another company's property, but my own house, I cannot look after,"" lamented Mirafuentes, as he tried to convince a police officer to let him past the checkpoint. Then, the barangay captain, Albert Dalisay, stepped forward and spoke to Mirafuentes in a rather stern voice. He, too, was frustrated. ""Haven't I told you everything the government said, that you should leave our barangay? Although it's ours, we can't have our way because we're being sent away for our own good. I also left behind so many animals, a pregnant pig, back home. I can't go in, too. You're worried about stuff. As for me, it's a pig back there. It will die there. I'll feed it to dogs if they want it. No one wants it. No one would buy it. So don't push it. Don't make a scene. Just go your way,"" he told Mirafuentes off. As Mirafuentes stepped away grumbling, Dalisay walked up to him. It looked like it was going to be a full-blown fight. ""Don't give me that attitude!"" Dalisay, who was older, barked at Mirafuentes. Soldiers and policemen stepped in and asked Dalisay to pull back. Mirafuentes hopped on his motorcycle and sped off to the evacuation center where he and his family were staying. Villagers who arrived before sunrise were able to go in because the full lockdown order had not yet been relayed to the checkpoint then. Those who arrived later could only watch as their neighbors emerged onboard cars and tricycles clutching some last few items before they are indefinitely barred from their homes. A few trucks drove past, carrying goats or horses. Jaymark Marqueses got to the checkpoint a little too late only because he first picked grass to feed his family's 5 cows. Ash from Taal Volcano now covers the cows' pasture, and there isn't any clean water around for them to drink. Their survival is dependent on members of the family visiting each day with water and fresh grass for them. Unable to haul off their cows, Marqueses worries that the lockdown would starve their livestock, in which the family had invested a small fortune. ""We are risking our lives just to save our livestock because we didn't just take them from nowhere. We raised and cared for them. We raised capital to buy those cows."" As they count the days shacking up with relatives or at evacuation centers all over the provinces affected by the volcano, the villagers pine for their homes that represent a way of life that was suddenly snatched from them. ""Just walking here makes me tremble. Makes me tear up. We really left everything,"" said Jackie Lizardo, a grandmother who has lived all her life in Barangay Janopol Occidental. She stood beside a soldier, who was candid enough to tell Rappler that he does understand how the villagers must be feeling, and how cruel it seemed to keep them away from their homes, but their orders are to preserve lives above all. Watching an army truck park in the middle of the road to her village – to close it off from the rest of the world – Lizardo came to a realization. ""If it really happens, if the volcano does blow, then we won't have a home to return to at all."" – Rappler.com "

A Tagalog-Japanese interpreter shown on a large monitor via video link told the two women the rulings when the Yamagata District Court imposed a prison term of 18 months, suspended for 3 years, on both Blessyl Avilanes Singson, 33, and Grace Ann Cabatit Ragadio, 34, in separate rulings. Video links had been used to connect the courtroom and a separate room in the same court for witness interrogations.

222,249931,"January 22, 2020",Philippines,Duterte wins De Lima habeas data case at Supreme Court,Lian Buan,"The Supreme Court unanimously rules that the President is immune from suit   MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte won a Supreme Court case yet again, as the en banc unanimously denied Senator Leila de Lima's petition for a writ of habeas data against him. ""The Court dismisses the petition for the writ of habeas data on the ground that respondent Rodrigo Roa Duterte as the incumbent President of the Philippines is immune from suit during his incumbency,"" said the en banc in a decision dated October 15, 2019, but released to media only on Wednesday, January 22. Retired chief justice Lucas Bersamin penned the resolution, with concurrences from all justices, except Associate Justice Jose Reyes Jr who was on leave. A petition for the writ of habeas data asks the Court to compel the respondent to remove damaging information about the petitioner, violating his or her rights to privacy. De Lima filed the petition against Duterte in 2016 after the President delivered several speeches accusing the opposition senator of having links to drugs. Duterte also called De Lima ""an immoral, dirty woman"" for having a supposed affair with Ronnie Dayan, who served as bodyguard to the former justice secretary-turned-senator. It was also Duterte who floated a supposed De Lima sex tape that his allies at the House of Representatives threatened to show in public as the House investigated the senator for alleged drug links. In a 23-page resolution, the en banc reiterated that the sitting president is immune from criminal, civil and administrative suit. ""The Chief Executive must first be allowed to end his tenure (not his term) either through resignation or removal by impeachment. Being a member of Congress, the petitioner is well aware of this, and she cannot sincerely claim that she is bereft of any remedy,"" said the ruling. Is Duterte immune from extraordinary writ proceedings? In his separate concurring opinion, Associate Justice Marvic Leonen pointed out that the president is not immune from the proceedings for the issuance of a writ of habeas data because it is not criminal, civil, or administrative in nature. But Leonen said the respondent must have been somebody else, for example, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea. ""While the president remains immune from suit during incumbency, petitions for a writ of amparo or habeas data may still be filed against his or her official acts, as long as the executive secretary, or the relevant officers, are named as party respondents,"" Leonen said. Leonen added that the ponencia's ""automatic dismissal"" of the petition based only on immunity from suit ""demeans the values enshrined in our Constitution."" ""It sets a dangerous precedent that the president is untouchable and cannot be held accountable for extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances committed during his or her incumbency,"" said Leonen. Are the writs still effective? The Supreme Court earlier acted on a petition for writ of habeas data filed by Leyte 3rd District Representative Vicente Veloso, an administration ally, against Duterte's narcolist that included him. Veloso named Medialdea the respondent, representing Duterte. Veloso eventually lost the main case at the Court of Appeals (CA), in a series of losses of similar requests that highlight the ineffectiveness of extraordinary writs in Duterte's war against criminality. Duterte has enjoyed an overwhelming winning streak at the Supreme Court, with his martial law in Mindanao upheld thrice, as justices gave him almost unbridled discretion. In his separate concurring opinion, Associate Justice Andres Reyes Jr said Duterte ""has the right to exercise freedom of expression."" ""A remark made in a fit of anger and as an expression of one's frustration over the conduct of another falls within the ambit of freedom of expression and does not automatically make one legally accountable lest we deprive the speaker of his right to speak,"" said Reyes. – Rappler.com "

Pamela Anderson wed Hollywood producer Jon Peters, more than 3 decades after the couple first dated. Photo by Thomas Samson/AFP LOS ANGELES, USA – Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson has tied the knot for a 5th time, to hairdresser-turned-Hollywood mogul Jon Peters. The actress and animal rights activist wed Batman producer Peters on Monday, January 20, more than 3 decades after the pair first dated. ""They were married yesterday in a private ceremony in Malibu. They love each other very much,"" a source connected to the couple told AFP. Penning a lovestruck statement in the form of a poem after the nuptials, Anderson dubbed Peters ""the original 'bad boy' of Hollywood."" ""No one compares – I love him deeply like family,"" Anderson wrote to The Hollywood Reporter. Canadian-born Anderson, 52, has previously been married to rockers Tommy Lee and Kid Rock. She twice wed professional poker player Rick Salomon. More recently she dated French soccer star Adil Rami, with whom she lived in France. Peters, 74, a former hair stylist, rose to Hollywood prominence after a high-profile romance with Barbra Streisand, going on to produce her 1976 version of A Star Is Born. He subsequently oversaw the Tim Burton Batman films in the 1980s and 1990s, and brought another DC comic books icon back to the screen in 2006's Superman Returns. He was co-chairman of Columbia Pictures for a stint in the 1990s. Peters told THR: ""There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but – for 35 years – I've only wanted Pamela."" Peters reportedly first met Anderson at the Playboy Mansion in the 1980s, and proposed to her shortly after. But until recently the pair had grown apart – when asked about their relationship in an interview with THR in 2017, Peters said: ""You'll have to do your research. I can't even remember anymore."" The wedding is also Peters' fifth time at the altar, with his most recent marriage ending in 2004. ""His life used to scare me. So much for a girl like me,"" wrote Anderson. ""Now I've seen more of life and realize .. He's been there all along."" Anderson, a prolific social media user, has yet to mention the wedding on those platforms. But on Monday she posted a series of black-and-white photo portraits on Instagram captioned with romance-themed quotes. One read: ""Love is in the air."" – Rappler.com "

Hidilyn Diaz is on track of a return stint to the quadrennial meet that will be held in Tokyo, Japan. Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – With 6 months to go before the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, Team Philippines is working towards supporting more national athletes who are seeking to qualify for the quadrennial meet in Japan. In a meeting with various national sports association (NSA) representatives on Wednesday, January 22, Team Philippines chef de mission (CDM) to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Mariano ""Nonong"" Araneta narrowed down the list to a realistic target of 38 Olympians for the Tokyo 2020 edition. According to Araneta, there are originally 49 more athletes, aside from gymnast Carlos Yulo and pole vaulter EJ Obiena, across 15 sports that are vying for a slot in the biggest multi-sport event that will run from July 24 to August 9. Only archery and triathlon have not been included in the list of sports due to their absence in the first chef de mission meeting. In the running for an Olympics berth are 2016 Rio silver medalist Hidilyn Diaz, skateboarder Margielyn Didal and and golfer Yuka Saso, as their current rankings virtually assure them of an appearance in the quadrennial meet. Araneta also mentioned that boxing will possibly be the sport with the largest delegation as 6 Filipino pugs, bannered by women's world champion Nesthy Petecio and men's world silver medalist Eumir Marcial, have a strong chance to snagging a slot in their upcoming Olympic qualifiers in February and May. Team Philippines is also pinning its hopes on the country's 3x3 men's basketball team that nailed a berth in the Olympic qualifier to be held in March. To add to the P100 million budget committed by President Rodrigo Duterte, Philippines Sports Commission (PSC) chairman Butch Ramirez hopes that the agency can receive an additional P200 million for the long-term goal of sustaining the athletes' performances until the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. ""We have to motivate the government leadership na hindi lang ito sa pang-Tokyo. Dapat mag-add ang Presidente ng P200 million kasi ito (Tokyo), maliit lang ang gastos kasi 6 months lang pero kung titignan for 3 Olympic cycles, mahabang proseso iyan,"" said Ramirez. (We have to motivate the government leadership that we're not only looking at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The President should add P200 million because the expenses for Tokyo, which will be spent within 6 months, are not as big as what we would spend for 3 Olympic cycles. That's a long process.) As of now, only Yulo and Obiena have officially qualified for the quadrennial meet, which merits them the full support of PSC. The 24-year-old Obiena was the first Filipino to gain a slot in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after he surpassed the qualifying standard last September. World gymnastics champion Yulo followed when he placed 18th out of 160 athletes in the world to advance to the men's individual all-around final of the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships last October in Stuttgart, Germany. – Rappler.com    "

Senator Ronald 'Bato' dela Rosa's visa to the United States has been cancelled. Photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa confirmed on Wednesday, January 22, that his US visa has been canceled. In December, Politiko reported that Washington revoked Dela Rosa's US visa as it strengthened its crackdown on human rights violators. The senator was the architect of the Duterte administration's bloody campaign against illegal drugs when he was Philippine National Police chief. Dela Rosa confirmed the cancellation of his US visa in a text message: ""Yes. They officially answered my official query."" The top-cop-turned-senator said he did not know the specific date when his visa was canceled. It was supposed to expire in 2022. ""Basta mag-apply lang daw ako uli kung gusto ko, kasi the present visa was canceled (I was told to just apply again if I want, because the present visa was cancelled),"" Dela Rosa said. Dela Rosa led President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs when he was PNP chief from July 2016 to April 2018. (READ: Duterte says his only 'sin' is extrajudicial killings) According to the Philippine government tally, cops had killed at least 5,500 suspects  after allegedly ""fighting back"" during anti-drug operations. Human rights groups, however, estimate the kill tally to be over 30,000, including killings inspired by Duterte’s war on drugs. In an interview with reporters, Dela Rosa on Wednesday said that he had inquired about the status of his visa in December, and received a reply on January 20. “I received their official answer the day before my birthday, January 20. What a good birthday gift,” Dela Rosa said. “[The letter was] informing me that my visa is no longer valid for travel to the United States. Should I want to apply for another visa, I reapply subject to rules and regulations,” he added. Dela Rosa said that the reason for the revocation of his visa was not stated in the letter. Reapply for a US visa? Dela Rosa said that he would apply for a US visa if President Rodrigo Duterte accepts the invitation of US President Donald Trump to attend the US-Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in Las Vegas in March, and if Duterte asks him to join that trip. “Titingnan ko kung pupunta si Presidente Duterte sa kanyang invitation ni Trump, just in case pupunta siya at pasasamahin niya ako do’n, then I will apply (I will see if President Duterte will accept Trump’s invitation, just in case he will go and ask me to come with him, then I will apply),"" Dela Rosa said. Should he reapply, there are two US laws that sanction travel bans against human rights violators. The Asia Reassurance Initiative is a US law aimed at developing a “long-term strategic vision and a comprehensive, multifaceted, and principled United States policy for the Indo-Pacific region.” It gives power to the US president to “impose targeted financial penalties and visa ban sanctions” to any individual or entity that violates human rights or religious freedoms, or engages in censorship activities. Then there’s the Global Magnitsky Act that imposes the same sanctions specifically on human rights violators anywhere in the world. The US Senate recently approved a resolution that invoked the Global Magnitsky Act on those involved in the ""wrongful"" detention of Senator Leila de Lima and extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. – Rappler.com "

Upon reaching the sports complex in the city, he was told ""puno na po (it's already full),"" as it has already taken in the most number of evacuees in the province. He was asked instead to go to the nearby village Libjo to take their chances. ""Meron pong nagrekomenda doon sa amin na babae, tatlo.

After that, they started taking in more evacuees until their resort was full. State volcanologists said that the threat of a major explosion remains possible within ""hours, days, or weeks.""

Photo by Yonhap/AFP SEOUL, South Korea – A transgender South Korean soldier who enlisted as a man and underwent a sex change last year pleaded tearfully to be allowed to stay in uniform Wednesday, January 22, after the military decided to discharge her. The country remains deeply conservative about matters of sexual identity and is less tolerant of LGBT rights than some other parts of Asia, with many gay and transgender Koreans living largely under the radar. Byun Hee-soo, a staff sergeant in her 20s, enlisted voluntarily in 2017, and went on to have gender-reassignment surgery in November in Thailand. She had expressed her desire to remain in the army but a military panel ruled on Wednesday that she will be compulsorily discharged. Byun waived her previous anonymity to appear at a press conference, wearing her fatigues and saluting the gathered journalists and cameras. ""I'm a soldier of the Republic of Korea,"" she said, her voice breaking. Serving in the military had always been her childhood dream, she said, but she had suffered from depression due to gender dysphoria, prompting her to undergo the sex-change surgery. ""Putting aside my sexual identity, I want to show everyone that I can be one of the great soldiers defending this country,"" said Byun, fighting back tears. ""Please give me that chance."" South Korea has a conscript army to defend itself against the nuclear-armed North, with all able-bodied male citizens obliged to serve for nearly two years. A defence ministry spokesman said Byun had undergone tests at a military hospital, which classified the loss of male genitals as a mental or physical handicap, prompting the panel review. Her case ""corresponded to one of the reasons for being unable to continue service"", the army said in a statement, without giving specifics and saying it sought to avoid ""unfair discrimination and treatment"". The Military Human Rights Center for Korea, an advocacy group in Seoul, said the army had ordered Byun to be effectively discharged when she leaves hospital on Thursday. ""It shows the military's determination to not allow a transgender in the army even for one second,"" said the organisation's head Lim Tae-hoon. ""It is truly cruel.""

The New York Times reported on Sunday, January 19, that the State Department concluded that an influence campaign was underway because they observed similar social media activity over the period of the protests, which otherwise had little in common. In Chile, nearly 10% of tweets that supported the protests in late October came from Twitter accounts that had a high certainty of being linked to Russia. In Bolivia, immediately after President Evo Morales resigned on November 10, the number of tweets associated with Russia-linked accounts went from less than 5 to more than 1,000 a day. And over a 30-day perod, Russia-linked accounts posted similar messages within 90 minutes of each other in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, and Chile. The Russian operations in South America appear to have been aimed at stirring dissent among the countries that supported President Nicolás Maduro's resignation in Venezuela. The State Department routinely monitors suspicious activity on Twitter worldwide. Their analyses were sent to the New York Times when they asked what the department had seen during and after the protests. “We are noting a thumb on the scales,” said Kevin O’Reilly, the deputy assistant secretary of state overseeing issues in the Western Hemisphere. “It has made the normal dispute resolutions of a democratic society more contentious and more difficult.” Russian influence campaigns on social media have affected elections in the US and Europe, sowed anti-Western sentiment in Africa, and moved China and Iran to use similar tactics. In the Philippines, similar tactics of Russian propaganda warfare have been observed since 2015 and ""experts"" who are cited by state-financed Russian news organizations are also cited by Philippine websites that spread disinformation. – Rappler.com "

241,249950,"January 22, 2020",Philippines,SC upholds seafarer's right to post-employment medical checkup,Rappler.com,"The High Court grants the $62,000-disability claim of seaman Apolinario Zonio Jr – who developed diabetes mellitus at work – against his employers  COURT OF LAST RESORT. The Supreme Court in Padre Faure, Manila. MANILA, Philippines – The Supreme Court has granted the disability claim of a seafarer against his recruitment company and its foreign principal – a ruling that upheld seafarers' right to demand from their employers a fully-paid post-employment medical examination. In an 18-page decision penned by Associate Justice Henri Jean Paul Inting, the High Court granted the $62,024-claim of seafarer Apolinario Zonio Jr against his recruitment company 88 Aces Maritime Services, Incorporated, and its foreign principal Khalifa Algosaibi Diving & Services Company. The Court said $60,000 of that amount is for disability benefits and $2,024.60 for sickness allowance due to Zonio, who developed diabetes mellitus at work. The amount would be paid to Zonio in its peso equivalent at the time of actual payment. The Court reversed the decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and the Court of Appeals which had earlier junked Zonio’s disability claim. The SC ruled that Zonio was entitled to permanent disability benefits and sickness allowance after he developed diabetes at work.  It also ordered 88 Aces and Khalifa Algosaibi to pay Zonio’s attorney’s fees amounting to 10% of the total monetary award given to the seaman. Job-related illness In ruling in favor of Zonio, the Court cited the seaman's medical records that supported his claim that his ship duties led to his diabetes mellitus. It also said after the seaman's repatriation at the end of his contract, the respondents had the opportunity to refer the seaman to a company-designated physician to check his health but it did not do so. The Court said that between “the non-existent medical assessment of the company-designated physician and the medical assessment of Apolinario [Zonio]’s doctor of choice – stating that his disability is permanent and total – the latter evidently stands.” The SC said the recruitment agency was at fault for not granting Zonio’s post-employment medical examination. “Having failed to present evidence to defeat the presumption of work-relatedness of Zonio’s diabetes mellitus, the prima facie case that it is work-related prevails,” the Court said. Case Zonio had worked as ordinary seaman on board the MV Algosaibi 42 for a 6 month-contract. When completed his contract in August 2010, he was not sent home as he directly entered into a new contract with his recruitment agency’s foreign principal, Khalifa Algosaibi. His new contract lasted until April 2012, and he was then repatriated to Manila. In 2015, Zonio filed a complaint before the labor arbiter against 88 Aces and Khalifa Algosaib for refusing to shoulder his medical expenses as his contract had ended. In his complaint, Zonio said when he was still on board the MV Algosaibi 42 in 2010, he had bouts of dizziness and was sent to the Salama Hospital in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia, where he was diagnosed as having high glucose and cholesterol. He was given medicine and advised to observe proper diet and avoid stress, but two years later, in 2012, he again had bouts of dizziness accompanied by blurred vision. When he returned to the same hospital, he was diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Since the respondents denied his request to pay for a post-employment medical examination, Zonio had to consult a private doctor in 2013, who confirmed that he suffered from diabetes mellitus. He also consulted a municipal health officer who declared that he was physically unfit to continue working because of hyperglycemia. Zonio demanded the payment of his disability benefits but 88 Aces rejected his plea, prompting him to file a complaint.  The  labor arbiter ruled in Zonio’s favor, so 88 Aces elevated the case before the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC reversed the labor arbiter’s ruling, prompting Zonio  to elevated the case the case before the CA, where it met a similar fate. He then brought the case before the High Court.  prompting the seaman to seek go to the SC. – Rappler.com  "

Masked passengers arrive at the Sungshan Airport in Taipei on January 22, 2020. Photo by Sam Yeh/AFP TAIPEI, Taiwan – The emergence of a deadly new virus in China has ignited fresh anger in neighboring Taiwan about how the island has been squeezed out of international bodies, including the World Health Organization. Modern Taiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation for the last 7 decades and has emerged as one of Asia's most progressive democracies. But it is quarantined on the world stage, only recognized diplomatically by a handful of countries and pushed out of crucial global meetings under pressure from Beijing. That isolation has been thrown into sharp relief by the new SARS-like virus that has emerged in China -- with the first positive case confirmed in Taiwan on Tuesday. (READ: China warns virus could mutate, spread as death toll rises) Taiwan has been denied access to the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's main meeting – since 2017 under pressure from Beijing which loathes the island's current president Tsai Ing-wen, who won a landslide second term earlier this month. At a press conference on Wednesday, Tsai renewed her calls for Taiwan to be allowed to attend WHO meetings and other bodies. ""Political considerations should not surpass protection for the people,"" she told reporters, adding that the island's 23 million inhabitants face the same health risks and threats as the rest of the world. ""I want to again urge the WHO not to exclude Taiwan for political reasons. Taiwan is on the frontline of global infectious disease prevention. The WHO should have a space for Taiwan's participation,"" she added. Beijing views Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary. It has ramped up its campaign to isolate the island ever since Tsai's first election victory in 2016 because she does not acknowledge their view that Taiwan is part of ""one China"". The headline-grabbing parts of this campaign have involved increased military and economic pressure as well as persuading seven more countries to abandon Taipei diplomatically. It has also pushed companies to list the island as a province of China rather than a separate territory. Beijing has also waged a successful campaign to keep Taiwan locked out of global bodies. Alongside the WHA, Taiwan has been frozen out of the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations agency that covers aviation. Policy reversed At the UN itself – which ditched Taiwan in favor of the People's Republic of China in 1971 – Taiwanese diplomats and journalists are routinely excluded because of their passports. In December, Axios reported that Taiwanese employees at the World Bank were being told to obtain Chinese travel documents. Axios said the policy was later reversed after their report. In her comments on Wednesday, Tsai called on China to be ""open and transparent"" about the new virus outbreak as well as sharing information with Taiwan ""fully and accurately"". Most analysts say China has been far more open and quick to share data on the Wuhan outbreak compared to the 2003 SARS outbreak which was covered up for months. But suspicions still run high in Taiwan because of historical precedent. The island's ability to fight SARS back in 2003 was hampered by the fact that officials were unable to get crucial data from Beijing and the WHO, media reports at the time show. ""China's responses were slow during the SARS outbreak in terms of investigating the cause and sharing information,"" Huang Li-min, president of the Infectious Disease Society of Taiwan, told AFP. ""This time China is releasing information more quickly,"" he added. Among Taiwanese social media users, there has been anger about the island's continued exclusion from the WHO. ""Give Taiwan a seat at the table,"" Jessica Drun, an academic, wrote in a Tweet directed at the WHO's account. – Rappler.com "

With the game all but over in favor of the 3rd-seeded Jayhawks, KSU guard DaJuan Gordon stole the ball from Kansas' Silvio De Sousa with 5 seconds left for what was expected to be an easy, meaningless layup. But De Sousa had other plans and emphatically rejected the Wildcat’s layup as time expired and stared him down, causing other KSU players to flare up and confront De Sousa.     A massive brawl then ensued with De Sousa clearly throwing punches to players and a man in a black shirt who went up to him. Fellow Jayhawks Marcus Garrett and David McCormack then cornered the black-shirted man as De Sousa even tried to throw a chair in his direction.  A huge brawl went down at the end of the Kansas-KSU game...(via @Riley_Gates)pic.twitter.com/lIwNfMgHFx  Thanks to numerous security and team personnel who restrained the heated players, the brawl was over before further damage was done. De Sousa was assessed a technical foul as the Jayhawks cruised to an 81-60 victory. However, De Sousa will likely face more sanctions in the coming days as head coach Bill Self called the debacle an “embarrassment,” according to a CNN article. UPDATE: Kansas’ Silvio De Sousa got slapped with a 12-game suspension. KSU’s inactive player James Love, who figured in the brawl in street clothes, got suspended for 8 games, Wildcats’ Antonio Gordon received 3 and Jayhawks’ David McCormack had 2. KSU coach Bruce Weber apologized for the unnecessary brawl. “It should have been avoided,” he said in an interview with The Capital Sports Report. “It’s my guys, it’s my fault. They came here wanting to have a game, compete, and we didn’t compete the way we needed to, and probably a little frustration, especially the young guys.” – Rappler.com  "

Investigators wrapped up their investigation last week into the alleged sales by ""Haurus,"" the code name for the DGSI officer, now 33, who was arrested in September 2018. His partner and 4 of his clients, including a private detective, have also been charged in the inquiry. Investigators became suspicious after France's OCRIEST agency, charged with stopping illegal immigration, noticed offers of unusually detailed personal information and ""Gold"" quality copies of official documents on the so-called darknet, which offers users total anonymity. Haurus charged 100 to 300 euros ($110-$330) or more for fake identification cards, driver's licenses, or birth certificates, as well as bank documents, phone records or GPS coordinates for tracking specific individuals. ""You provide the identity/registration number to copy, or your own requests, and I'll find what you need,"" read one message from Haurus on the Blackhand v2 forum, according to details of the investigation seen by AFP. Haurus even touted a ""starter pack"" of a French driver's licence, an ID card and six blank cheques, for 500 euros instead of 680 euros. An anonymous tip alerted investigators of a request to Haurus that eventually identified him as a DGSI agent. An investigation found that 90% of the agent's internal information requests had nothing to do with his work, and that he and his partners were enjoying the high life, staying in ritzy hotels on numerous vacations. More alarming, the Parisien newspaper reported that a former thief imprisoned on drug charges bought tracking data from Haurus on 3 people -- two of whom were later murdered, while the third survived an attempt on his life. Haurus spent 5 months in prison before being released under judicial supervision. His lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, declined to comment when contacted by AFP. – Rappler.com "

Edwina Bilog, an evacuee from San Nicolas, Batangas, shares to lawmakers on January 22, 2020, how difficult life has been for her in the past days since Taal Volcano erupted. Photo by Rappler BATANGAS, Philippines – Evacuees barred from returning to their lakeside villages in Batangas could not stop their tears on Wednesday, January 22, as they urged lawmakers to help them go back to fishing in the lake around the restive Taal Volcano. Edwina Bilog, who hails from Barangay Alas-as in San Nicolas town, could barely finish her sentences as she told members of the House of Representatives that fishing is a way of life for people in her village. (WATCH: Fishermen risk lives for catch around restive Taal Volcano) ""Ako po'y taos-puso pong nalapit sa inyo na nawa kami po'y inyong tulungan.

(I am wholeheartedly appealing to you all to please help us. We won't be able to send our children to school if we wouldn't be able to fish there.) Ramon Gamo, captain of Barangay Pulang Bato, also made a similar plea. He hopes his people would once again be allowed to catch tilapia and tawilis in Taal Lake surrounding the volcano, over which Alert Level 4 is still raised. ""Sana po 'wag din 'nyo po 'yung alisin at doon po lang kami nabubuhay sa amin pong hanapbuhay na 'yun.

(I hope you'll no longer prohibit us from fishing there because that's our livelihood. And in case you let us fish again, that would allow our barangay to recover much faster.) The House invited several evacuees and local officials to attend its plenary session held at the Batangas City Convention Center on Wednesday to directly listen to their stories. (WATCH: LIVE: House holds session in Batangas amid eruption of the Taal Volcano) During the session, Daniel Reyes, mayor of Agoncillo, Batangas, shared that despite the lockdown imposed on his town and 10 others, many of his constituents still try to sneak in just so they could feed their pets and livestock. Reyes hopes the House would be able to allocate funds for animal rescue. ""If we leave them, they die, which will add more time to the rehabilitation process. I humbly suggest that funds be allocated to retrieve these animals for government purchase or some other equally doable solution. As for the domestic animals, they too must be rescued because they are also part of the family,"" the mayor said. Reyes also said evacuees need medical and psychological interventions to ""help us cope with the situation we are now in."" House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano then said he already gave instructions to House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez, House committee on disaster management chairperson Lucy Torres Gomez, and Deputy Speaker Loren Legarda to take the lead in crafting a comprehensive action plan so the lower chamber can help address the evacuees' needs. ""Malakas na tayo sa relief and response, pero mahina pa sa rehab....

(The relief and response efforts now are strong, but we're still weak in the area of rehabilitation.... You know that the changes are institutional in nature, but we'll guarantee that even if we're no longer in Congress, these changes will continue.) P30-billion supplemental budget sought During the session, the lawmakers adopted House Resolution (HR) No. 655 calling for the ""immediate release"" of funds to be used for the complete rehabilitation of the communities affected by the Taal Volcano eruption. The resolution was penned by the legislators representing the 6 districts in Batangas, who also filed a bill on Wednesday that seeks to allocate P30 billion from the National Treasury as supplemental budget for the Taal Volcano eruption. This is in line with the request of President Rodrigo Duterte. Lawmakers also adopted HR No. 662, which expresses the ""support and commitment"" of the House to work with all the concerned agencies to pass the proposed supplemental budget ""to expedite effective and responsive assistance"" to affected residents. Alert Level 4 for Taal Volcano means there could be a hazardous eruption ""within hours to days.” The volcano's level of sulfur dioxide emission has been lower for two days now, but state volcanologists said a longer trend or pattern must be observed first. Batangas and its neighboring province Cavite are still under a state of calamity.

Photo from TNC/Twitter MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Dota 2 team TNC found themselves in the lower bracket of the Leipzig Major playoffs  after a tumultous run in the group stages that saw them win only 1 of the 5 games they played. Having won the Chengdu Major late last year, TNC entered the tourney as a heavy favorite in their group, which featured Fnatic, Team Aster, and Nigma. The 3 currently rank 19th, 13th, and 12th while TNC ranks 2nd on the ESL world rankings. While world rankings are hardly the barometer for predicting match results, it's at least an indicator of how well teams have played recently. In the group stages held over the weekend, TNC won the first game against dark horse Nigma, with an Io-Faceless Void pairing that dictated the pace and demolished the opposing team. But that would be the last win for TNC in the preliminaries. Nigma turned the tables in the second game with Tiny, Ember Spirit, and Outworld Devourer that seemed nearly untouchable in the closing minutes, tying the series 1-1. The next game was a nightmare, which saw TNC score only one kill against the opponents' 25. In the next series, Team Aster – whom TNC had previously swept at their last meeting in December – paid TNC back with a 2-0 sweep of their own. With two series losses, TNC was knocked down to the lower bracket, where teams are one series loss away from being eliminated. In the upper bracket, teams have to lose two series before being eliminated. Many of TNC’s fans attributed their losses to their draft picks and bans, citing that the heroes the team picked did not synergize well with each other . Dexter Tan Guan Hao from Dot Esports, meanwhile, think that the game’s latest update remains to blame for TNC’s string of lackluster performances. The latest big update for the game – patch 7.23 or the Outlanders update – went live in late November, leading to December struggles that slightly marred an otherwise excellent 2019. “The current iteration of TNC has lived and died by their teamfights. Their disjointedness in the Outlanders update has been concerning for a team so reliant on coordination,” he explained. TNC, however, is not out of the competition yet. The team’s hopes of bagging the lion’s share of a $1 million prize pool stays alive after defeating Reality Rift in a do-or-die match, Wednesday, in the first round of the lower bracket playoffs. Though Reality Rift was a heavy underdog to TNC, the win is as close to a salve the team could get now – a quick breather. A real challenge comes next against the winner of the match between veterans Team Secret and Fnatic. TNC has a day to regroup.

""I wanted to wait till I finished China, to be honest with you. I always like to be very transparent. I wanted to wait till I finished China. I didn't want to go with China and Europe at the same time."" 'Arbitrarily putting taxes' Trumps comments followed a warning by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that Washington would deliver on long threatened auto tariffs if Europeans go through with a digital tax that mainly targets US firms. ""If people want to arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we will consider putting taxes arbitrarily on car companies,"" Mnuchin told a panel at the four-day talk-fest. EU-US trade relations deteriorated soon after Trump came to power three years ago and declared a war against the yawning trade deficit with Europe. The earliest transatlantic skirmish came when Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, notably from the EU, which responded by taxing iconic US products, including denim jeans and motorcycles. Trump then threatened duties on European cars, which is of particular concern to Germany, but has so far backed down under the pressure of US lawmakers. The US and EU agreed to pursue a trade deal in July 2017 as a tentative truce, but negotiations have stalled over farming. Trump's comments came a day after he said he held positive meeting with new EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on working towards reaching a US-EU trade pact. A French diplomatic source said over the weekend that French President Emmanauel Macron and Trump agreed in telephone talks to give negotiations a chance to avoid ""a trade war that will benefit no one"". Washington had also moved this month to ease tensions on other trade fronts. The US Senate this month voted to approve a new trade agreement linking the United States, Canada and Mexico.

If I were in Agoncillo and my favorite dog was there, I'd probably go in. You have to understand where they're coming from,"" Arcilla said in a mix of English and Filipino. Talisay Vice Mayor Charlie Natanauan earlier encouraged residents to return to their homes and start cleaning up even if the municipality is within the Taal Volcano's 14-kilometer danger zone.

A Phivolcs official said that while they respect Natanauan's ""feelings"" as he is ""under so much stress,"" they are also ""firm"" in their science.

""In the case of Taal, before Taal's alert warning escalated, the community there was already warned. In fact, when it came to warnings, the community there on the Taal Volcano island was prioritized.

As a proof, no one died in the escalation of the volcanic activity on the island,"" Timbal said in a mix of English and Filipino. Timbal noted that the Phivolcs also conducted regular information and education campaigns on volcanic hazards in the communities surrounding the volcano, which helped the local government units to evacuate the people ahead of the volcanic activity.

Despite Derrick Rose’s scoring surge, the Pistons can't catch a break. Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images/AFP MANILA, Philippines – While Derrick Rose’s resurgence campaign continues to run full steam ahead, the Detroit Pistons are still a lagging train wreck in the new NBA season. As the former league MVP continues to churn out efficient scoring bursts in his new sixth man role, the Pistons are still nowhere near contention in the weaker Eastern Conference with a mediocre 16-28 record. Because of this, a handful of contenders are looking to trade for the crafty veteran guard in the hope of boosting his and their chances at winning the NBA championship, including the Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers and the Philadelphia 76ers. Not only is Rose averaging a stellar 18.4 points and 5.8 assists on nearly 50% shooting, the 30-year-old combo guard also has a very moveable two-year, $15 million contract. If ever the Lakers land Rose to play with fellow former MVP LeBron James, the 34-9 Lakers will get even more formidable as they solve their bench scoring woes. However, they would probably have to create a package around streaky forward Kyle Kuzma for the Pistons to consider giving up their best point guard.    The Clippers, meanwhile, have no such problem regarding bench production at all, with Montrezl Harrell and reigning Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams lording over the second unit. Adding Rose will just push the Clippers to an unprecedented and enviable spot of having 3 bench players averaging at least 18 points a game. That’s not even counting star starters Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, who are averaging 27.1 and 23.5 markers, respectively. As for the Sixers, adding Rose will give them much-needed perimeter shooting to pair with the post-ups of their unorthodox point guard Ben Simmons. Sitting at just 5th place in the East with a 29-16 record, Philadelphia is certainly still a piece away from securing top dog status in the conference like last year. With the Pistons looking to hit the reset button in the aftermath of Blake Griffin’s season-ending knee injury, dealing Rose for future assets can certainly speed up that process. Meanwhile, Rose can restart his quest for that elusive first taste of an NBA title – a journey that he started in Chicago more than a decade ago. –Rappler.com "

The Malaysia-based Lawyers for Liberty alleged last week that Singapore prison officers had been instructed to manually break the necks of prisoners if the rope used to hang them broke during executions. This was done by kicking the back of the prisoner's neck, said the group, which based its report on information from an anonymous prison officer. The city-state imposes the death penalty for crimes such as drug trafficking and murder, and hanged 13 people in 2018, according to official data. Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday slammed the allegations as ""untrue, baseless and preposterous,"" noting the rope had never broken during a hanging. It said all executions ""are carried out in strict compliance with the law"", and the use of any unlawful method would have been investigated and dealt with. It accused the rights group of making the allegations to try and get reprieves for Malaysian drug traffickers. Using a new law against online falsehoods, the interior minister also ordered Yahoo Singapore, a local activist and a political website to carry correction notices alongside their reports on the issue. The minister asked Lawyers for Liberty do to the same, but the organization said it would not comply. ""Singapore has no business interfering with the freedom of speech of Malaysian citizens making statements within our own country,"" the group said in a statement. An opposition political party has for the first time challenged the law in court amid concerns it was being used to stifle criticism ahead of elections and a judge has reserved judgement on the case. The legislation gives authorities the power to order corrections placed next to posts they deem false. Since the law came into force in October, several opposition figures and activists have been ordered to place a banner next to online posts stating that they contain false information. – Rappler.com "

Wednesday's plenary session was held at the Batangas City Convention Center, about 3 kilometers away from the Batangas Sports Complex, the biggest evacuation center for families affected by the Taal Volcano eruption. Lawmakers drew flak for their out-of-town session, as it required local officials – who are busy with ongoing relief efforts – to squeeze in time to arrange logistical and security arrangements for their high-profile guests. Cayetano, however, argued that Batangueño legislators agreed when the House leadership asked them if they were okay with holding the session closer to the displaced residents. He added several House members even opted to ride one bus to go to Batangas City, located outside the danger zone, instead of taking their private vehicles. ""'Di ba logistically mas may problema kung 300 kami at different times pumunta dito? Kasi wala pa akong nakausap na kongresista na ayaw tumulong on their own.

Because I haven't spoken to a congressman who did not want to help. So by doing mass transportation – many came on the bus – we lessened the logistical issues.) During the session, several evacuees prohibited from returning to their lakeside villages urged lawmakers to help them go back to fishing in Taal Lake, which surrounds the volcano. Agoncillo, Batangas Mayor Daniel Reyes also said his people need psychological interventions to help them process their trauma from the eruption. Cayetano already instructed Majority Leader Martin Romualdez and other House leaders to take the lead in coming up with a comprehensive action plan so the lower chamber can help address the needs raised by the evacuees during the session. The House also adopted two resolutions that support the swift release of the funds needed to help Taal recover, including the P30-billion supplemental budget that Batangas lawmakers are pushing for. Alert Level 4 is still raised over Taal, which means there could be a hazardous eruption ""within hours to days.""

In the resolution, Pimentel cited several instances when Angkas tussled with the law. Angkas is considered illegal because of the 55-year-old Land Transportation and Traffic Code. Several lawmakers at the Senate and House of Representatives had filed bills seeking to amend it to allow the operations of motorcycle taxis.

File photo by Apu Gomes/Getty Images/AFP NEW YORK, USA – Tesla's market value hit $100 billion for the first time on Wednesday, January 22, triggering a payout plan that could be worth billions for Elon Musk, founder and chief of the electric carmaker. Shares in Tesla rose some 4.8% in opening trade to extend the gains in the value of the fast-growing maker of electric vehicles. Under a compensation plan approved by Tesla's board in 2018, Musk is to be paid in stock awards based on the value of the company, which could be worth as much as $50 billion if Tesla reaches $650 billion. Musk agreed to the plan, which would pay him nothing until Tesla's value reached $100 billion. The package, using shares which ""vest"" based on certain criteria, gives Musk stock worth around 1% of the company for each of 12 milestones over a 10-year period. For achieving the first milestone, Musk will get shares worth $346 million if Tesla shares hold above $100 billion over six months, based on the formula. In announcing the plan in March 2018, the company said Musk ""would receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind -- no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time"" without the rise in value. In 2019, Tesla sold some 367,000 vehicles, a rise of 50% from the prior year. That is a fraction of the 10 million sold by leading global automakers Toyota and Volkswagen, but investors have pushed up Tesla's value in the expectation that it is changing the industry. Tesla has begun manufacturing in China and has announced a new plant in Germany that could start production by 2021. The Tesla Model 3 electric car is designed to be more affordable than its earlier models – around half the cost of the $70,000 models –and is fueling expectations of stronger growth.

Philippine economic growth picks up in the 4th quarter of 2019, but it is still not enough to lift the overall average. Photo from Shutterstock MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Philippines' gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 6.4% in the 4th quarter of 2019, but it was not enough to propel the year's average within the government's target band. The government aimed for economic growth to hit somewhere between 6% and 6.5%, but the 2019 average settled at 5.9%, said the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) on Thursday, January 23. This is the slowest growth in 8 years. GDP growth needed to be at least 6.8% to cling on to the lower end of the target. For the 4th quarter, services recorded the fastest growth at 7.9%, followed by industry at 5.4% and agriculture at 1.4%. For the whole year of 2019, services posted growth of 7.1%, while industry and agriculture registered growth rates of 4.9% and 1.5%, respectively. Meanwhile, per capita GDP for 2019 stood at 4.6%. LOOK: All the numbers you need to know about GDP growth in 2019. @rapplerdotcom pic.twitter.com/AklrPd2saP  Growth was much slower than expected during the first half of the year due to the delayed passage of the 2019 budget over alleged pork barrel or illegal funds. The reenactment of the budget meant government underspending of over P1 billion per day for 4 months and stalled infrastructure projects. (READ: Budget delay kept 420,000 Filipinos poor – economic team) ""We have seen our economy facing several challenges right at the start of 2019 as the budget impasse led to delays in the implementation of government programs and projects. Adding to the problem was the election ban on certain, mainly infrastructure, projects,"" said Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia. ""Therefore, we are thankful that our colleagues in Congress and the Department of Budget and Management ensured the timely passage of the 2020 General Appropriations Act and also approved the validity extension of the 2019 fiscal program until the end of this year – both of which are critical to our efforts to spur economic growth. Going forward, there is a need to reconfigure budget and disbursement protocols that are more robust,"" he added. Pernia also cited the mild El Niño during the first half of 2019, the spread of African swine fever in Luzon, as well as the global slowdown due to the trade war between the United States and China as drags for growth. ""We must now identify specific products for which the country could be an alternative manufacturing base, bearing in mind the comparative advantage for domestic players. The entry of these [multinational companies] and international players could serve as a way to better integrate our domestic industries into the global value chain and bolster our manufacturing growth in the long run,"" he said. The impact of monetary tightening by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) in 2018 was also felt in the first months of 2019. ""The growth miss and recent volcanic eruption's damage could prod the BSP to cut policy rates sooner rather than later. We continue to pencil in a 25-basis-points rate cut at the February 6 meeting given the disappointing growth numbers,"" said Nicholas Mapa, senior economist of ING Bank Manila. The downward revision for the 3rd quarter from 6.2% to 6% also did not help lift the overall figure. The PSA noted slower growth in other services and construction.

""Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr Jeff Bezos' phone are absurd,"" the Saudi Arabian embassy said on its Twitter account. ""We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out."" The UN Special Rapporteurs said the circumstances and timing of the hacking also gave grounds for further investigation into ""allegations that the Crown Prince ordered, incited, or, at a minimum, was aware of planning for"" the operation to kill Khashoggi. Callamard last year led an independent probe that found ""credible evidence"" linking the crown prince to Khashoggi's killing -- a charge the kingdom vehemently denies. 'Unprecedented exfiltration' of data The two experts said they had become aware of a 2019 examination of Bezos's iPhone that found it may have been hacked on May 1, 2018 with an MP4 video file sent from an account used by the Saudi Crown Prince. The two had exchanged numbers a month before, they said. The analysis reportedly found that within hours of receiving the video file, there was an ""unprecedented exfiltration"" of 126 MB of data from Bezos's phone. This continued undetected over a period of ""some months"" with rates of as much as 4.6 GB higher than the baseline. The forensic analysis cited by the UN experts showed that the Crown Prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, sent WhatsApp messages to Bezos in November 2018 and February 2019 in which he revealed information about Bezos's personal life not available from public sources. The analysis also suggested that the hackers may have used a type of spyware used in other Saudi surveillance cases, such as the NSO Group's Pegasus-3 malware. $38 billion divorce Bezos's personal life was thrust into the spotlight with the announcement in January 2019 that he and his wife were divorcing after 25 years of marriage, and the revelation by the National Enquirer that he had been having an affair with a former news anchor, Lauren Sanchez. Bezos, the world's richest man, and his wife MacKenzie finalised their divorce in July 2019 to the tune of a $38-billion (34-billion-euro) settlement, according to Bloomberg News. Following the scandal, Bezos hired Gavin de Becker & Associates, a security firm, to find out how his intimate text messages and photos made their way into the hands of the National Enquirer. In March last year de Becker said he had concluded that Saudi Arabian authorities hacked the Amazon chief's phone to access his personal data. But de Becker did not specify which part of the Saudi government he was blaming for the hack, and gave few details about how he had concluded that the kingdom was responsible. – Rappler.com "
271,249980,"January 23, 2020",Tech Features,What makes tech 'evil?',Victor Barreiro Jr.,"There are now more avenues for technology to be used justifiably in 'evil' ways because technological innovation appears to have charged forward towards the growth of social injustice   I recently read through Slate’s “The Evil List,” which attempted to address and list down the 30 most concerning tech companies through ballots sent to journalists, scholars, and notable technology-centered critical thinkers. It’s a pretty spot-on list, with well-known American companies – Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple – high up on the rankings for a variety of reasons. Now, those companies aren't the point of this entire discussion today, but The Evil List did make me think about what would make technology or a tech company behind a particular innovation evil. Sadly, such a question isn’t always a palatable one to think about, because it can lead down a very anxiety-ridden rabbit hole of uncomfortable thoughts.   Technology as tool? I still believe technology is a tool – one in which the use of the tool can be good or evil depending on who is using it – but it gets more difficult by the day to reason out in this fashion. The discussion of tech as “simply amoral” has long been a part of scientific circles, such as when technological innovations like explosives and atomic energy were discovered. Yet, the discussion persists. This might be due to how we built up certain aspects of human society. To wit, there are now more avenues for technology to be used justifiably in “evil” ways because technological innovation appears to have charged forward towards the growth of social injustice. An ideal of social justice and examples of injustice The concept of social justice or injustice is quite the long-winded concept, but let’s center today’s discussion on one ideal of social justice. People should have equal (or perhaps the better term is equitable) access to resources to allow them to grow in society, whether that’s the need for adequate wealth, healthcare, societal privileges, or opportunities regardless of their current status in life and adjusting for whatever circumstances may hinder a person’s potential growth in society at present. Sadly, we  are already at a deficit when it comes to creating social justice because it’s really hard to see how the above statement occurs in reality. More importantly, technology, or the mindset behind current technological innovation – pivoting towards profits rather than social good – can make this worse.   Some simple examples include game developers creating games and systems within their games which may foster addictive behaviors and enhance spending to make money. Jim Sterling of The Jimquisition discusses these sorts of “surprise mechanics” more in the video above. There are also created biases in artificial intelligence that make life harder for minorities they’re used on. (READ: Western academia helps build China's automated racism) Let us not forget the ideas of disinformation and hacking campaigns used to stir up hatred, misinform the public, and control the narrative of discussion in a given nation or topic whether or not you even live in the country the disinformation is targeted in. (READ: Disinformation efforts now used in 70 countries – researchers) Society is broken, and the fix is hard In 2015, Practical Action Publishing released a short published work of around 30-something pages called Technology Justice: A Call to Action. One of the statements in that short write-up fit the discussion today, which I’d like to share. “Technological innovation is not driven by a focus on the most pressing social and environmental challenges we face. It is not targeted enough on improving the conditions of those living in poverty. And the gains and risks of innovation are distributed unevenly between public and private sources of investment.” This, simply put, leads a very difficult decision. Much like climate change, which in itself requires a drastic change in human society’s habits towards consumption, people in positions of power have to make hard choices and take careful stock of how accepting society as built towards the acquisition of profit or power is making things worse. When it comes to enabling security and safety for the citizens of a country, it’s certainly not by creating a surveillance state, as might be the case in Russia with its facial recognition network or China with… well, its overwhelming number of cameras for facial recognition and social credit system, and skewed artificial intelligence initiatives.  (READ: Confusion clouds China's social credit system) It also means we rebuild artificial intelligence to follow rules to avoid bias. It means we tax people with more to give back services that help people who have less, and invest in making sustainable technologies that allows us to do this better. Society is broken, and technology and our “innovative pushes” both reflect and make some of the worst aspects of society even worse. The fix isn't insurmountable, but much like addictive behavior pointed towards spending in games, society has a REALLY hard habit to break. – Rappler.com "

US President Donald Trump pauses while speaking at the Economic Club of New York at the New York Hilton Midtown November 12, 2019, in New York, New York. Photo by Brendan Smialowski/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – Democrats began laying out a detailed case on Wednesday, January 22 for the removal of President Donald Trump, accusing him at his historic Senate impeachment trial of seeking to cheat to ensure re-election in November. Adam Schiff, the head of the prosecution team from the House of Representatives, took the floor of the Senate for opening arguments after lawmakers were told by the sergeant-at-arms to remain silent ""on pain of imprisonment."" ""President Trump solicited foreign interference in our democratic elections, abusing the powers of his office to seek help from abroad to improve his re-election prospects at home,"" the California lawmaker told a hushed chamber. ""And when he was caught, he used the powers of that office to obstruct the investigation into his own misconduct,"" said Schiff, who headed the probe that led to Trump's December 18 impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House. Schiff shrugged off Republican arguments that American voters – and not the Senate – should decide whether Trump should remain in the White House. ""The president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box for we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won,"" Schiff said. ""The president has shown that he believes he is above the law."" Trump is accused of withholding military aid from Ukraine to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to announce an investigation into Democrat Joe Biden. ""It was a smear tactic against a political opponent President Trump apparently feared,"" Schiff said at the nationally televised Senate trial. ""President Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to a strategic partner at war with Russia to secure foreign help with his re-election,"" he said. ""In other words, to cheat. ""If this conduct is not impeachable, then nothing is."" Interspersing his remarks with videos and graphics and references to the Constitution, Schiff appealed to the members of the Senate to put aside partisanship in deciding Trump's fate. ""These are politically charged times,"" he acknowledged. ""Tempers can run high, particularly where this president is concerned."" But, Schiff said, ""the Constitution entrusts to you the responsibility of acting as impartial jurors."" 'Fairly quickly' Republicans, who hold a 53 to 47 edge in the Senate, have shown little inclination, however, to break ranks with a president who has a history of lashing out ferociously at his perceived enemies. A two-thirds majority – or 67 senators – is needed to remove Trump from office and a series of votes on the ground rules for the trial on Tuesday followed strict party lines. Republicans shot down repeated efforts by Democrats to introduce White House witnesses and documents at the start of just the third impeachment trial in US history. Trump, who was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos as the historic trial got underway on Tuesday, blasted the proceedings as a ""witchhunt"" and a ""hoax"" and said he expected the Senate to clear him ""fairly quickly."" The president defended the Republicans' rejection of Democratic efforts to force former national security advisor John Bolton and others to testify at his trial saying of Bolton, for example, that it would present a ""national security problem."" ""John, he knows some of my thoughts,"" Trump said. ""He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive?"" House impeachment managers have 24 hours over 3 days to make their case that Trump is guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. White House lawyers then have 24 hours to present their defense. Senators will then have an opportunity to ask written questions to be read out aloud by US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial. Roberts' role is mostly ceremonial but he did warn both sides during heated exchanges on Tuesday to watch their decorum. ""Those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,"" Roberts said. 'Quit obsessing' Trump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, said the White House will ""challenge aggressively the case that they're putting forward."" ""There's a lot of things to rebut and we'll do it in an orderly and systematic fashion,"" he told CNN. The next few days are likely to be an endurance test for members of the Senate, some of whom are in their 80s. Senators are barred from having their cellphones and computers at their desks and they have been spending their time chatting quietly or scribbling on notepads when not listening intently. The 4 Democratic senators seeking to challenge Trump for the White House have been forced to take time off from campaigning ahead of the first state caucuses to choose their party's nominee in Iowa on February 3. Reaction to the impeachment trial has been mixed among voters. ""The general consensus I feel I hear from people is 'Why don't they just freaking do their jobs and quit obsessing over this?'"" said Rick D'Agostino, the owner of the Sheffield Lanes bowling lanes in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. Flavio Quintela, a Washington businessman, said he thought the impeachment trial was ""more theatrical now than anything."" ""Because, you know, the Senate is most likely not approving it,"" Quintela said. ""It really looks like some electoral move, which I don't think is going to work."" – Rappler.com "
274,249983,"January 23, 2020",Europe,UK parliament ratifies Brexit divorce law,Agence France-Presse,"The only hurdle left to formal ratification now is royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II, paving the way for Britain to leave the EU on January 31  BOO BREXIT. An anti-Brexit activist holds a flag in the colors of both the EU and Union flags as they protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London on October 22, 2019. Photo by Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP) LONDON, United Kingdom – After years of acrimonious debate, British lawmakers on Wednesday, January 22 finally approved the terms of their country's historic departure from the European Union – due in just 9 days time. MPs in the lower House of Commons had already backed the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which ratifies the divorce deal that Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck with Brussels last year. But the unelected upper House of Lords made some changes this week, including on the rights of EU citizens and child refugees after Brexit. In a series of votes on Wednesday, the Commons – where Johnson's Conservatives have a large majority – rejected all 5 amendments and sent the bill back to the Lords, who then reluctantly agreed to back down. The only hurdle left to formal ratification now is royal assent by Queen Elizabeth II, which could come as soon as Thursday, paving the way for Britain to leave the EU on January 31. The European Parliament still has to back the deal in a vote next week but its approval in London is a historic moment, as Britain edges closer to becoming the first country to leave the 28-member EU. ""At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we've done it,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Now we can put the rancor and division of the past 3 years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future."" New dynamic It is a huge personal achievement for Johnson, who took office last year promising to end several years of political wrangling that had divided the country and paralyzed successive governments. His predecessor, Theresa May, negotiated a Brexit deal with Brussels in 2018 but the Commons rejected it 3 times, forcing her to resign. Johnson then agreed changes to the text with Brussels, only to be defeated again by MPs unable to agree on the timetable for turning his new deal into law. He accused them of trying to frustrate the result of the landmark 2016 referendum vote for Brexit and forced a snap election last month. The result, with Johnson returned to office on a thumping majority, fundamentally upended the dynamic and MPs swiftly backed the agreement. The Lords put up a minor fight this week. One amendment sought to alter the government's scheme to register around 3.6 million EU citizens living in Britain, to give them physical documents proving their right to stay. Another change would have required the government to negotiate the right of unaccompanied child refugees in the EU to join relatives in Britain. 'Tight timetable' The Brexit deal protects the rights of EU citizens, makes special trading arrangements for the British province of Northern Ireland, and settles the UK's EU debts. It also paves the way for transition phase until December 31, in which UK-EU ties will remain largely the same while both sides try to agree a new trading and security partnership. But the shape of that future relationship remains unresolved – and negotiating it could pose an even bigger challenge than agreeing the divorce. In a speech early next month, Johnson is expected to set out more detail of his hopes for a free trade agreement with Brussels along the lines of the EU's recent deal with Canada. ""I'm absolutely confident that we can do that,"" Johnson said on Wednesday while taking questions online from members of the public. He wants to both preserve free-flowing commerce between Britain and its largest trading partner across the Channel, and strike agreements with other countries – namely the United States. Brussels has warned that it is impossible to address all issues in that time, suggesting a more limited deal is now likely. But while UK finance minister Sajid Javid admitted on Wednesday that it was a ""tight timetable,"" he agreed with Johnson that it could be done. The premier's office denied a row with Washington over London's proposed tax on tech giants would affect trade negotiations after Brexit, saying: ""It's not part of the discussions."" – Rappler.com "

The respiratory virus has claimed 17 lives since emerging from a seafood and animal market in the central city of Wuhan, infected hundreds of other people and been detected as far away as the United States. (READ: South Korea confirms first case of SARS-like virus from China) Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan were eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the major city of 11 million people, where most of the cases have been identified. Trains and planes out of Wuhan were indefinitely suspended and tollways on roads out the city were closed, leading to fear and panic for those who were trapped. ""We are feeling as though it is the end of the world,"" said one Wuhan resident on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, voicing concerns about shortages of food and disinfectant. Another described being on the ""verge of tears"" when the de facto quarantine was announced, with the misery compounded by it coming on the eve of the Lunar New Year holiday. Hours later, authorities in neighbouring Huanggang announced public transport and train services would be suspended at midnight, while people were told to not leave the city of 7.5 million. All of Huanggang's cinemas, internet cafes, and the central market will close. A third city, 1.1 million-population Ezhou, announced the train station had been closed earlier in the day. And highways were closed in neighbouring Xiantao, while public transport will be suspended from midnight in nearby Chibi. The two cities have a combined population of around two million people. As efforts to contain the virus spread, Beijing cancelled massive gatherings that usually attract throngs at temples during the New Year holiday, while the historic Forbidden City will close from Saturday. (READ: Singapore confirms first case of Wuhan virus) Empty streets Wuhan's train station and airport, which should have been packed with people travelling for holiday family reunions, were almost empty except for workers on Thursday afternoon. The few people wandering in the streets of the city were wearing masks as mandated by police. More than 570 people have been infected with the virus across China – with most cases found in Wuhan, where a market that illegally sold wild animals has been identified as the epicentre. The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Like SARS, it can be passed among people through the respiratory tract. The first case of the new virus was confirmed on December 31, and it has since been detected in Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States, plus the first confirmed cases in Singapore and Vietnam on Thursday. The 17 people who died in China were aged from 48 to 89, and had pre-existing health conditions, Chinese health authorities said Thursday. The World Health Organization was to hold a meeting Thursday to decide whether to declare a global health emergency – a rare instrument used only for the worst outbreaks. 'Sealed off' With hundreds of millions of people travelling across China this week for the Lunar New Year holiday, the National Health Commission announced on Wednesday measures to curb the disease nationwide -- including sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains. Wuhan's special anti-virus command center said the quarantine measures were meant to ""effectively cut off the virus spread, resolutely curb the outbreak and guarantee the people's health and safety"", according to state media. While departures were banned, trains and planes were still allowed into the city. The city's tourism and culture department cancelled all group tours until February 8, according to state media, as well as all large public events for the Lunar New Year holiday. Tom Solomon, a professor at the University of Liverpool, warned that imposing a lockdown could be ""counter-productive."" ""It can increase the level of panic, and just cause people to flee by other means,"" he said. Unknowns Animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak, with Chinese health officials saying the virus originated from the animal market. Studies published this week suggest that the virus may have originated in bats or snakes. The WHO has confirmed that the virus can be passed between people, at least those in close contact. Chinese health officials warned it could mutate and spread further. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) Chinese authorities on Thursday reported dozens of new infections, bringing the confirmed total to 571.

Countries have intensified efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen – known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Demonstrator vapes during a rally outside of the White House to protest the proposed vaping flavor ban in Washington DC on November 9, 2019. Photo by Jose Luis Magana/AFP GENEVA, Switzerland – Electronic cigarettes are harmful both to users and bystanders exposed to the fumes, the World Health Organization says in a report, warning they can damage growing fetuses and impact teenagers' brains. So-called electronic nicotine delivery systems, or ENDS, have been pushed by producers as well as some governments as a safer alternative to smoking, and as a path to kicking the habit. But in a strongly-worded series of questions and answers about such e-cigarettes, the UN health agency said there was not enough evidence to say they help smokers quit, but that there was clear evidence they are dangerous. ""There is no doubt that they are harmful to health and are not safe,"" WHO said in one answer, stressing though that ""it is too early to provide a clear answer on the long-term impact of using them or being exposed to them."" The battery-powered devices that enable users to inhale addictive nicotine liquids and exhale vapor ""are particularly risky when used by adolescents,"" WHO said, strengthening initial warnings it made in 2019. ""Nicotine is highly addictive and young people’s brains develop up to their mid-twenties,"" it said in a document published Tuesday, January 21, stressing that ""exposure to nicotine can have long-lasting, damaging effects."" This is of high concern amid skyrocketing popularity of vaping among young people in many countries. At the same time, there is little indication that using e-cigarettes is keeping teens away from more harmful products, with the WHO pointing out that those using ENDS are more likely to smoke conventional cigarettes. 'Significant risks' And it said that ""for pregnant women, ENDS pose significant risks as they can damage the growing fetus."" Amid growing fears over serious health consequences linked to e-cigarette use, WHO warned that so-called vaping increases the risk of heart disease and lung disorders. The United States especially has seen a major health crisis tied to vaping: an acute lung illness epidemic that has killed more than 50 people and sickened more than 2,500 in the United States. The illness was later linked to a substance called vitamin E acetate, which is used as a thickening agent for vaping products containing the main psychoactive substance of cannabis – THC – that are often sold on the black market. At least 5 other countries have initiated investigations to identify cases of lung injuries related to e-cigarette use, WHO said. The UN health agency also said second-hand exposure to e-cigarette fumes was harmful, pointing out that the aerosols ""typically contain toxic substances, including glycol which is used to make antifreeze."" ""ENDS pose risks to users and non-users,"" it said, demanding tight regulation of the products, including bans on marketing to young people and on use in indoor workplaces and public spaces. The WHO document drew ire from some experts, with Peter Hajek, the head of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London, accusing it of ""anti-vaping activism."" In a comment re-tweeted by Philip Morris, he charged that the document was filled with errors and that the authors ""should take responsibility for using blatant misinformation to prevent smokers from switching to a much less risky alternative."" – Rappler.com "

Photo by Ralph Gatti/AFP LONDON, United Kingdom – Monty Python star Terry Jones has died at the age of 77 after a long battle with a rare form of dementia, sparking an outpouring of tributes on Wednesday, January 22. ""We have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humor has given pleasure to countless millions across 6 decades,"" his family said in a statement. They said the Welsh-born writer, actor, comedian and director died late on Tuesday, January 21 at his home in north London with his wife at his side. Jones directed some of the comedy troupe's most-loved works, including the 1979 movie Life Of Brian, about a man mistaken for the Son of God, which sparked criticism from the Church. Playing Brian's mother, Mandy Cohen, he memorably delivered the line: ""Now, you listen here! He's not the Messiah. He's a very naughty boy!"" Fellow Python Michael Palin, with whom Jones also collaborated on the cult series Ripping Yarns, said his friend was generous, supportive, and passionate and believed in living life to the full. ""He was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation,"" said Palin. Jones appeared as a variety of characters in the BBC television series Monty Python's Flying Circus, often portraying middle-aged ladies, and also its famous naked organist. His second wife Anna and children Bill, Sally and Siri said he had fought an ""extremely brave but always good-humoured battle"" with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which impaired his ability to speak. They called him a ""true polymath"", adding: ""We lived in the presence of an extraordinarily talented, playful and happy man living a truly authentic life, in his words, 'lovingly frosted with glucose'."" Spam and Chaucer Born in North Wales on February 1, 1942, his family moved to Surrey, southwest of London, when he was 4 years old. He developed an interest in mediaeval history while studying at Oxford University, where he joined forces with Palin. Jones wrote books and presented medieval television programs throughout his career, and was an expert on the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, the English poet and author of The Canterbury Tales. His college, St Edmund Hall, said it was ""deeply saddened"" at his death. ""He studied English here, was an honorary fellow and donated over 700 books to the library. He will be sorely missed."" After Oxford, he starred in television shows like Do Not Adjust Your Set and wrote for David Frost before a meeting in a curry house in 1969 gave birth to Monty Python. Jones and Palin teamed up with Cambridge graduates Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, and US animator Terry Gilliam to discuss working together on a new BBC comedy. Monty Python's Flying Circus ran for 45 episodes over 4 series between 1969 and 1974 and the surreal sketch show broke the boundaries of TV comedy. Jones's much-loved characters included Arthur ""Two Sheds"" Jackson, Cardinal Biggles of the Spanish Inquisitio,n and Mr Creosote, a monstrously obese restaurant patron. Another of his best-known lines was ""Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam"", playing a waitress running through a menu made up entirely of the canned pork meat product. Jones co-directed Monty Python And The Holy Grail in 1975 with Gilliam, and was sole director on Life Of Brian and 1983's The Meaning Of Life. He also wrote the screenplay for the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, starring David Bowie. 'Dear beloved brother' Jones is the second Python to pass away after Chapman died of cancer in 1989. The remaining members took part in a reunion in 2014 which rapidly sold out 10 nights at London's vast O2 Arena.

On December 31, 2019 a firefighter hoses down trees and flying embers in an effort to secure nearby houses from bushfires near the town of Nowra in the Australian state of New South Wales. Photo by Saeed Khan/AFP SYDNEY, Australia – Australian firefighters are on high alert for the possibility that scorching temperatures and strong winds could whip up new bushfires on Thursday, January 23, coming after rain brought welcome respite to fire-ravaged areas. Unprecedented bushfires fuelled by climate change have killed at least 29 people and devastated vast swathes of the country since September. Those blazes have been followed by extreme weather – including intense storms that have battered parts of Australia with giant hail, floods and landslides – that has hampered clean-up operations in some areas. (READ: #ReliefPH: Help communities affected by Australia’s raging bushfires) Heavy rainfall has helped to contain and, in some cases, extinguish long-running blazes but an expected return to searing heat and gusting winds Thursday was flagged as a cause for concern as dozens of fires continued to burn. Temperatures will tip above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country – including in Australia's biggest city, Sydney – while wind gusts of up to 90 kilometers per hour (55 miles per hour) are forecast in some areas. New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said firefighters were on ""heightened levels of alert,"" with bans on lighting fires in place across much of the state amid predictions of ""severe"" fire danger. ""There's every potential for flare-ups and new ignitions to come out of some of these fire grounds, remembering we've got thousands of kilometers of fire perimeter,"" he told reporters. ""A lot of it has been extinguished, a lot of it is under control – but there are still pockets that are burning and smoldering and we don't know how many additional roots, tree stumps, or branches are likely to flare up under those conditions."" Cooler weather was forecast to return on Friday, January 24, again easing the immediate threat from fires, but the bushfire season still has weeks left to run. The months-long crisis has sparked renewed calls for Australia's conservative government to take immediate action on climate change, with street protests urging Prime Minister Scott Morrison to reduce the country's reliance on coal. A major coal conference in Wollongong – situated in a coal-producing region south of Sydney that has been hit by massive blazes – was cancelled this week in response to what local climate activists said was ""planned mass protest."" And a January poll released this week found the environment has soared to the top of Australians' concerns, with 41% of people polled by market research firm Ipsos ranking it as the most important national issue for the first time. While Morrison has now reluctantly acknowledged the link between the bushfire disaster and a warming planet, he has stopped short of announcing any sweeping new measures to address to cut emissions. Instead, the prime minister has signalled that his government would focus on climate adaption and building resilience. – Rappler.com "

A supporter of the US president wears a t-shirt reading ""pro God, pro gun, pro life, pro Trump"" as he attends a ""Keep America Great"" rally at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas on October 17, 2019. Photo by Nicholas Kamm/AFP) WASHINGTON, USA – Donald Trump said Wednesday, January 22 he plans to attend the March for Life rally this week and become the first president ever to address in-person America's biggest gathering of anti-abortion activists. ""See you on Friday... Big Crowd!"" Trump, who is seeking re-election in November, tweeted about the procession in Washington. Abortion rights activists have accused Trump of an anti-abortion agenda, and they have expressed anxiety that the 1973 Roe v Wade Supreme Court decision that effectively legalized abortion is under threat. Last year Vice President Mike Pence attended the March for Life rally, which is now in its 47th year and designed to protest legalized abortion. That time, Trump addressed the estimated 100,000-strong gathering with a video message. The White House confirmed Wednesday that Trump will become the first president ever to attend the rally. The march is usually held around the anniversary of Roe v Wade. Jeanne Mancini, president of the group that organizes the march, hailed the news and said Trump has been loyal to the anti-abortion movement. ""From the appointment of pro-life judges and federal workers, to cutting taxpayer funding for abortions here and abroad, to calling for an end to late-term abortions, President Trump and his administration have been consistent champions for life and their support for the March for Life has been unwavering,"" Mancini said. Although the Supreme Court legalized abortion, opposition to it remains strong in parts of American society, particularly in the so-called Bible Belt states of the South and mid-section of the country. Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to appoint only opponents of abortion to the Supreme Court, has so far named two of the court's 9 justices. Their arrival galvanized abortion opponents who are counting on the new justices to overturn the Roe v Wade decision, or at least allow states to restrict access to the procedure. The first big test will occur in March, when the court examines a Louisiana law whose restrictions on abortion are similar to those of a Texas law that the court struck down nearly 4 years ago. – Rappler.com "

It was not clear, however, who footed the bill. A dozen men and women on Monday, January 20, at the start of the hearing considering whether or not to hand over Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou to US authorities to face fraud charges, held up red and white hand-written signs that read ""Free Meng"" and ""Trump stop bullying us."" They declined to speak to an AFP journalist at the scene. But later a handful were tracked down and spoke to Canadian media, saying they were paid Can$100 ($76) to Can$150 for two hours' work that they had understood to be as extras in a movie shoot. The offer, they said, came through Facebook or acquaintances. ""A CBS reporter approached me and my friend and she started interviewing us.

""I'm honestly pretty ashamed and embarrassed,"" she said, explaining that she had not known about Meng or her legal saga. Meng is wanted by US authorities for alleged fraud related to sanctions against Iran. The US alleges she lied to HSBC about Huawei's relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran. Meng has denied the allegations.

In a statement, HRW Asia Advocacy Director John Sifton warned that the visa cancellation could just be the beginning of a series of consequences for those involved in President Rodrigo Duterte’s violent anti-illegal drugs campaign. “Dela Rosa may still have a date with justice,” he said. “[He] may soon enough face far bigger problems than trouble with his visa to the United States.” Dela Rosa on Tuesday, January 22, confirmed the cancellation of his visa, following a December 2019 report by Politiko amid intensified crackdown on human rights violators by the US government. According to HRW’s Sifton, the US State Department’s move sends a message that its country “won’t do business with government officials implicated in atrocities.” ""In revoking Senator Ronald dela Rosa’s visa, the US State Department has exercised its authority to deny visas to persons implicated in gross human rights abuses,"" he said.

Police present to the media tsome of the suspects in the killing of former Batangas congressman Edgar Mendoza and his 2 aides. Screenshot from PNP video MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Two inmates at the New Bilibid Prison – both clients of former Batangas 2nd District congressman Edgar Mendoza – conspired to kill the lawyer, the Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP CIDG) announced on Thursday, January 23. CIDG chief Brigadier General Jose Napoleon Coronel identified the principal suspect as murder convict Sherwin Sanchez, who allegedly conspired with fellow inmate Arthur Fajardo to have Mendoza killed. Mendoza and his aides, Ruel Ruiz and Nicanor Mendoza, were found burnt to the bone in the former lawmaker’s vehicle in Tiaong, Quezon, on January 9. “Based on the information we have gathered and statements of witnesses, the victim was ordered killed upon the instructions of principal suspect Sherwin Sanchez who is presently detained at the New Bilibid Prison, in conspiracy with another detainee at the New Bilibid Prison, Mr Arthur Fajardo, who is a member of the Fajardo kidnap-for-ransom group who has been detained since 2005,” Coronel said in a news briefing in Camp Crame. The police identified the 5 suspects involved in the killing as Jael Fajardo, Arthur’s wife; Jael’s household worker Madonna Palomar and her errand runner Kristine Fernandez; Carlo Acuña; and Ericsson Balbastro, who Coronel said was “involved in the killing, burning, and transporting of remains” of the 3 victims. The 5 suspects were arrested on Wednesday, January 22. Coronel said another suspect, Rodel Mercado, remained at large and was the subject of manhunt operations. There were also two other suspects – a man and a woman – who were not identified at the moment. Coronel said the police used interviews with witnesses, CCTV footage, and forensic evidence from the cellphone of the victims’ relatives and the victims’ cellphone transmissions to trace the itinerary of Mendoza and his aides, which later helped them identify the suspects. Motive Asked for the motive of the principal suspect, Coronel said Sanchez was a client of Mendoza, who was a lawyer. The cases of Sanchez, who was convicted of murder in 2015, were on transactions involving sums of money and real property. ""Apparently on the day he disappeared, and later on found dead, he was supposed to collect a sum of money from representatives of the principal suspect in Calamba,"" Coronel said. He said based on the testimonies of the witnesses and the confession of some of the suspects, Sanchez and Mendoza had disagreements on the amount to be collected by the lawyer, but later agreed on a sum ""amounting to millions of pesos."" Sanchez, however, had no intention to pay him from the start. ""Instead of paying the amount, amounting to millions of pesos, they just contacted a hired gun, contracted killers for the killing of Mr Mendoza for the sum of P100,000,"" Coronel said. The CIDG chief said Sanchez tapped fellow inmate Fajardo, also a client of Mendoza, to set up the slay. Fajardo contacted his wife, Jael, to hire the killers. Jael turned out to be the ""client"" whom Mendoza was to meet on the day he was last seen alive. (READ: Mendoza family urges 'client' of slain ex-Batangas congressman to hep cops) Coronel said that when Mendoza and his aides went to the home of Jael supposedly to collect the money owed to the lawyer, they were served coffee laced with sleeping pills. They were later stabbed and struck with a hard object by the hired killers. He said the 3 were also brought to San Juan, Batangas, before they were brought to Tiaong in Quezon, where the suspects burnt down Mendoza's car with the victims. Coronel said Balbastro was seen in CCTV footage driving the car of Mendoza, with the other suspect, Mercado in a motorcycle, behind him. The CIDG chief said the victims were already dead when they were burnt in the vehicle and were presumed to have died on the afternoon of January 8. Responding to questions, Coronel said  that while authorities were tracking down the suspects, Jael voluntarily surrendered through the mediation of a Police Regional Office 4 officer that she knew. He also said that the 3 hired killers – Acuña, Balbastro, and Mercado – received a P10,000 downpayment for the job but were not paid the balance. The 3 also had previous cases and were detained in Batangas, but were later released. PNP chief Lieutenant General Archie Gamboa said the CIDG has filed information for 3 counts or murder against the suspects before the Calamba City Prosecutor’s Office. Mendoza died just days before his 70th birthday. – Rappler.com  "

People are detained by police during a clearance operation after a demonstration against parallel trading in Sheung Shui in Hong Kong on January 5, 2020. Photo by Isaac Lawrence/AFP HONG KONG, China – A sharp dip in the frequency and ferocity of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests has raised questions over the future of the leaderless movement, rattled by a spike in arrests and increasingly aggressive police tactics. At a recent rally in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district, 36-year-old clerk Freesia held mixed emotions. Like so many Hong Kongers, he has spent much of the last 7 months risking injury and prosecution by attending protests pushing for greater democracy and police accountability. (READ: [ANALYSIS] Hong Kong’s hangover for 2020) But after 7,000 arrests and little sign of Beijing making any concessions, he wondered whether it was time for a change in tactics. ""We have to think of another way to fight for democracy instead of purely relying on street protests,"" he told AFP, waving a flag with the slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"". ""If we continue our fight against the police on the streets, Hong Kong people beating Hong Kong people, this will pose no threat to Beijing."" (READ: Hong Kong teachers living in fear over protest support) Similar debates are now raging on online forums, in cafes, bars and across dinner tables – how does Hong Kong's democracy movement stay alive? The last 7 months have radically changed the global business hub. The city is more ideologically divided than ever, its government and police force are loathed by swathes of the population, and the economy is in recession. 'A little break' After years of peaceful protests failing to achieve much, a new generation of young Hong Kongers have reasoned that violence is the only way to get results. Had the city's legislature not been besieged last summer, the plan to allow extraditions to mainland China that sparked the initial protests would have been passed. Then in November, the pro-democracy camp pulled off a landslide win with a record turnout in district-level elections. But on the movement's main demands – an independent inquiry into police conduct, an amnesty for protesters and the right to freely elect Hong Kong's leader – there has been less success. And with no recognized leader there is little consensus or direction for the future. Tony, a 35-year-old member of a group that waves American flags at rallies, said he was worried the movement had lost steam, especially since the local election win. ""Some might feel we have already achieved something and think it's time to take a little break,"" he told AFP. ""But for those of us who have been fighting at the front lines, we feel we have not achieved anything."" Protests are still commonplace. In early December and on New Year's Day, hundreds of thousands took to the streets for peaceful marches. And clashes still also occur. On the weekend police fired tear gas at tens of thousands gathered in a park after masked protesters assaulted a group of plainclothes officers. But there are now far fewer pitched battles compared with October and November. 'Political solution' Observers say the arrests of 3,000 protesters over those two months dealt a heavy blow to the movement – especially after police trapped hundreds in a university campus siege. ""We've lost many braves,"" a 14-year-old demonstrator surnamed Ng told AFP, using a term to describe frontliners. ""Many of my friends were arrested, I feel really frustrated."" The arrival of a new police chief in November has heralded more robust tactics. Officers have carried out widespread frisking ahead of rallies, repeatedly shutting down sanctioned protests as soon as anyone steps out of line. During one recent rally, police inside an HSBC branch pounced when radicals started vandalizing the building. ""Tactically, the more preventative approach has worked,"" an officer who asked for anonymity told AFP. ""But any closure will ultimately require a political solution."" Analyst Dixon Sing said the movement's more radical wing ""has learned some big lessons... that their militant acts may generate little in terms of extracting actual concessions"". But he added that these protests had still achieved major successes with the scrapping of the extradition bill and launch of a popular revolt that will last years. ""Both Hong Kong and the international community have been awakened to the reality that Beijing is a very repressive regime that refuses to budge on some very reasonable demands,"" Sing said. Recent consumer boycotts of businesses deemed to be pro-Beijing – and a push for people to join unions – could snowball this year, he added. Peter, a 24-year-old fresh graduate, said Hong Kong's leaders should not mistake the current lull as a victory. ""Police tactics have been successful in terms of arrests, but not on the political front,"" he warned. ""One day, people will fight back, when our anger next peaks."" – Rappler.com "

PNP Chief Lieutenant General Archie Gamboa says he would implement his policies with an 'iron fist if necessary.' PNP Photo MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – New top cop Lieutenant General Archie Francisco Gamboa has sacked 3 senior Central Visayas police officers for playing golf on weekdays. “I have ordered last night the relief of 3 senior officers in Central Visayas for violating my policy on not playing golf during weekdays,” Gamboa said in a news briefing in Camp Crame on Thursday, January 23. They are Colonel Dennis Artil, Police Regional Office-7 comptroller; Police Lieutenant Colonel Richard Bad-Ang, PRO-7 finance services chief; and Police Lieutenant Colonel Glenn Mayam, PRO-7 Drug Enforcement Group chief. “I have ordered their reassignment to the personnel holding and accounting unit at the national headquarters while undergoing investigation for flagrant violation of a specific directive, an act that constitutes grave misconduct,” Gamboa said. He said the incidents reflected on PRO-7 chief Brigadier General Valeriano de Leon. “Strike 1 na si (for) Regional Director PRO-7,” Gamboa said. He reiterated his warning to cops who would choose to play golf during weekdays despite his rule. ""As I have said just 3 days ago, now that I am PNP chief, I am vested withe the greater authority to implement the program of internal cleansing and organizational reform – even with iron fists if it will be necessary,” he said. Gamboa imposed the rule against playing golf on weekdays in October 2019, when he was still PNP OIC. He signed the order on October 15, 2019 – a day after the resignation of PNP chief General Oscar Albayalde. The move was seen as part of Gamboa's bid to win back public confidence in the police, following the drug-related controversy that prompted Albayalde to resign, and cast doubt on the credibility of the PNP. Asked whether the Central Visayas cops were sacked only after violating the rule once, Gamboa noted that the 3 ""were playing Tuesdays and Thursdays and if they got bored, they also played on Wednesday."" He reiterated that cops can play golf on weekdays or holidays, and that he sometimes allowed them to go the driving range after office hours. – Rappler.com "

Rafael Nadal may be favored to advance, but he's not immune to Grand Slam shocks. Photo by Glyn Kirk/AFP  MELBOURNE, Australia – Rafael Nadal will step up his bid for a record-equaling 20th Grand Slam title when he faces Argentina's Federico Delbonis at the Australian Open on Thursday, January 23. The Spaniard can only count one Melbourne title among his 19 Majors but he will be confident of reaching the third round at least after winning all 3 previous meetings with Delbonis. Swiss great Roger Federer, winner of 20 Grand Slam tournaments, and eight-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic are already through after straightforward wins. Nadal has dropped only 10 games to 76th-ranked Delbonis in their previous meetings but he's not immune to Grand Slam shocks, losing 4 times to players ranked 100 or lower. Victory in Melbourne would make Nadal the first man in the Open era – and only the third in history – to win all 4 Major titles twice, after Roy Emerson and Rod Laver. Fired-up Federer Ruthless Swiss master Federer said, though, he had ""plenty left in the tank"" as he kept intact his 20-year record of reaching at least the third round of the Australian Open after crushing Serb Filip Krajinovic on Wednesday. The six-time champion first played at Melbourne Park in 2000 and has gone on to make the semifinals or better on 14 occasions, with no exits before round 3. The 38-year-old 3rd seed dominated the 41st-ranked Krajinovic 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 on Rod Laver Arena, stretching his record over him to 4-0. Federer, who is bidding for a seventh title to match Djokovic's record, and his first since 2018, came into the tournament without playing a warm-up event but has nevertheless looked ominous. ""Very happy, been a great start to the season,"" he said as he moved a step closer to a 21st Grand Slam title. ""I feel really relaxed on court. I've trained hard and you always hope it pays off."" Asked if he felt sorry for Krajinovic, he replied: ""I do feel a bit sorry, but you've got to take advantage of it."" Over his two matches so far Federer has dropped just 13 games, and admitted he preferred easy early encounters rather than tough battles to preserve energy. ""I prefer this much more than overcooked. As easy as it looks, there's always the effort, trying to extend the lead,"" he said. ""Of course, it's not quite the same stress level if you're down a set or a break or two sets, whatever it may be. I prefer it this way because you have always extra left in the tank if you need it."" He faces a tougher assignment next against Australian John Millman, who beat him in 4 tough sets at the 2018 US Open. ""He's fit like a fiddle.

Photo by Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP PARIS, France – Jean-Paul Gaultier has bowed out of fashion with all the cheek and showmanship with which he has lit it up over the last half century. The legendary French provocateur bid farewell Wednesday, January 22 with an hour-long feelgood musical spectacular with an orchestra and a cast of hundreds to celebrate the friends and the often outrageous looks that helped make him a star. With what seemed like the entire fashion world gathered to pay tribute, the mammoth production began with a black coffin with two conical breasts sticking out of it being carried down a set worthy of Cecil B DeMille. It was Gaultier's knowing joke that the conical bra he famously put on Madonna will probably end up on his tombstone. British singer Boy George closed the show, with fashionistas on their feet as the designer emerged in the same blue work overalls as his studio staff when the curtain lifted to reveal the backstage. Raised onto the shoulders of some of the 220 models who had sashayed down the runway, he threw kisses as the audience chanted his name to the strains of the Culture Club hit ""Church of the Poison Mind"". The ode to freaks and outsiders echoed the way the maverick designer pioneered body positive thinking and gender fluidity long before they became fashionable. American singer Beth Ditto and the bearded Austrian drag queen Conchita Wurst were among the atypical models he managed to charm onto the catwalk. While Madonna herself did not make it to the show, the ""French Madonna"" Mylene Farmer did, along with a galaxy of Gallic stars including Betty Blue actress Beatrice Dalle. In a touching message before the curtain lifted, Gaultier gave the world a lesson in sustainability and making do. ""There are too many clothes and too many that are never worn. Don't throw them away, recycle them,"" he said, declaring his final collection was his first ""upcycled haute couture"" one. ""When I was a child my mother told me how she would turn my father's old worn trousers into skirts. That marked me. You can love a garment again by transforming it,"" Gaultier said. ""I have been doing that since... In my first show and in this my last there are creations made with the jeans I've worn,"" he said. ""It's the most beautiful of materials. Like a lot of humans, it becomes even more beautiful as it gets older."" The flamboyant creator stunned fans on Friday by announcing that the haute couture show in the French capital would be his last. 'Laughing and crying' Many believe the 67-year-old showman may now throw himself into showbiz. His Fashion Freak Show, a cheeky cabaret revue based on his life has been a popular and critical hit. With its catchphrase ""Tout le monde est beau!"" (""Everybody looks so good!""), it was a feel-good smash when he premiered it at the Folies Bergere in Paris in 2018. It is now touring Russia after an acclaimed London run. Gaultier's perfume range and high-end haute couture business, Gaultier Paris, will live on, the brand told AFP. ""For years now Jean Paul-Gaultier has been saying, 'I am going to have to make a decision (about the future)',""  said fashion historian Olivier Saillard. ""I think the success of the show has shown him a way,"" he added. ""It has been wonderful for him to see the public laughing and crying with him,"" the historian told AFP. ""It is so much more joyful than a fashion show, which lasts 11 minutes and where people are always on their phones taking photos."" The impish creator had previously carved out a cult following as a presenter of the late-night 1990s television show ""Eurotrash"". Gaultier stopped designing ready-to-wear clothes in 2015 to concentrate on haute couture – extravagant handmade clothes which only the world's richest women can afford.  Body-positive pioneer Never less than flamboyant, Gaultier was a fashion prodigy. From the start he challenged gender stereotypes and conventional ideas of beauty, once placing an advert for ""atypical"" models. ""The facially disfigured should not refrain from applying,"" he added. Saillard said the couturier was ""like a father"" to many top designers he had mentored over the years, but ""he feels fashion has changed terribly"". Nor was it a secret that Gaultier was unhappy with the Catalan luxury conglomerate Puig, who bought his brand in 2011. ""He will be back, but in a different way,"" said Saillard. – Rappler.com  "

In a statement, Agusan del Norte 1st District Representative Lawrence Fortun called on ABS-CBN “to immediately air an appropriate disclaimer, review and reconsider the content and story elements of the teleserye in order not to further besmirch the reputation of our historic city.” Fortun represents several towns and cities in the province, including Butuan City. The show’s pilot on Monday, January 20, involves an apparent bombing of a fictionalized Butuan City market. Following the explosion, top officers from the Army’s 4th Infantry Division express worry over how an attack slipped through in Butuan City, the regional center of Caraga. Fortun added: “Better still, as partial recompense for the damage this imprudence may have caused Butuan and its people, we implore upon them to do depict the real Butuan and feature stories about it in their news and public affairs programs."" He noted that the “lessons” from Bagani – an ABS-CBN show which also got backlash over cultural insensitivities – should have “taught them to be more circumspect and sensitive.” Fortun said in his statement that he is co-author of a measure in support of ABS-CBN’s franchise renewal. Responding to Fortun, ABS-CBN said: ""ABS-CBN would like to apologize to Agusan Del Norte Rep. Lawrence Fortun and the people of Butuan City if the scenes in the TV series A Soldier’s Heart have offended them.

However, with a little over two months left before the network's franchise expires, House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano said on January 22 there’s still ""enough time"" for Congress to tackle franchise renewals. In 2017, Duterte accused ABS-CBN of ""swindling"" after the network allegedly did not air his campaign advertisements during the 2016 presidential elections. This was the first time Duterte told Congress there's ""no need to renew"" ABS-CBN's franchise, which came just a few days after he renewed the franchise of rival network GMA Network for another 25 years. In December 2019, Duterte again told ABS-CBN that he ""will see to it that you're out,"" and that the media giant would be better off if it ""just sells"" the network instead.

The theories are based on examination of the genome sequence of the virus released by authorities in the wake of the outbreak, with two studies pointing to the likely role of bats in the outbreak. One study, published Tuesday, January 21 in the journal Science China Life Sciences, which is sponsored by Beijing's Chinese Academy of Sciences, looked at the relations between the new strain and other viruses. It found the coronavirus that emerged from China's Wuhan was closely related to a strain that exists in bats. ""Bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV (coronavirus) would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans,"" the researchers from several institutions in China wrote in the paper. That study did not speculate about which animal could have been an ""intermediate host,"" but a second study published Wednesday in the Journal of Medical Virology identifies snakes as the possible culprit. ""To search for (a) potential virus reservoir, we have carried out a comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison. Results from our analysis suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir,"" the paper says. The researchers caution that their conclusions require ""further validation by experimental studies in animal models."" Neither study explained how the virus may have been transmitted from animals to humans. But they could offer clues to Chinese authorities as they hunt for the source of the outbreak that has sickened hundreds of people in the country and has been confirmed as far afield as the United States. The food market where the deadly virus surfaced offered a range of exotic wildlife for sale, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game. Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from ""wild animals at the seafood market"" though the exact source remains undetermined. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat.

Photo by William West/AFP SYDNEY, Australia (UPDATED) – A waterbombing plane was missing and feared to have crashed in Australia's southeast on Thursday, January 23, as firefighters battled a new outbreak of bushfires whipped up by scorching temperatures and strong winds. At least 7 blazes were declared emergencies, including one in the Snowy Monaro region, where authorities lost contact with the firefighting aircraft. ""Local ground crews indicate the aircraft may have crashed,"" the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said in a statement. ""A number of helicopters are in the area carrying out a search."" Bushfires also forced the closure of Canberra Airport, with all flights in and out of the country's capital suspended due to approaching flames. Passenger flights were halted around midday (0100 GMT) as two out-of-control blazes burning immediately to the south and west of the airport merged and the combined fire bore down on 3 nearby suburbs. Temperatures soared to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Sydney, where a bushfire also broke out in a northwestern suburb of Australia's biggest city. Wind gusts had been forecast to reach 90 kilometers per hour (55 miles per hour) in some areas, but New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said the winds were stronger than expected, especially in the fire-ravaged southeast of the state. ""One of the big challenges we've got with the increased intensity of these winds is that it is proving very difficult to fly any aircraft to provide any aerial support to the firefighting effort on the ground,"" he said. ""We are trying to get some of the large air tankers and some of the very large helicopters involved, but it's proving very difficult. It's too dangerous to fly these things."" Fitzsimmons warned of a ""long, difficult afternoon"" ahead for firefighters and residents. 'A long way to go' Unprecedented bushfires fuelled by climate change have killed at least 29 people and devastated vast swathes of the country since September. The blazes have been followed by extreme weather that has hampered clean-up operations in some areas, including intense storms that have battered parts of Australia with giant hail, floods, and landslides. Heavy rainfall has helped to contain and, in some cases, extinguish long-running blazes but an expected return to searing heat and gusting winds Thursday was flagged as a cause for concern as dozens of fires continued to burn. Cooler weather was forecast to return on Friday, but the bushfire season still has weeks left to run. ""The fire season doesn't traditionally stop here in New South Wales until right up to the end of March,"" Fitzsimmons said. ""So we’ve got a long way to go this season and whilst the rainfall has been certainly welcome and the conditions have eased, we’re certainly not out of the fire season yet."" The months-long crisis has sparked renewed calls for Australia's conservative government to take immediate action on climate change, with street protests urging Prime Minister Scott Morrison to reduce the country's reliance on coal. A major coal conference in Wollongong – situated in a coal-producing region south of Sydney that has been hit by massive blazes – was cancelled this week in response to what local climate activists said was a ""planned mass protest."" And a January poll released this week found the environment has soared to the top of Australians' concerns, with 41% of people polled by market research firm Ipsos ranking it as the most important national issue for the first time. While Morrison has now reluctantly acknowledged the link between the bushfire disaster and a warming planet, he has stopped short of announcing any sweeping new measures to cut emissions. Instead, the prime minister has signalled that his government would focus on climate adaption and building resilience. – Rappler.com "

""Actually, nung isang araw, 50-50 na nga eh. Nagbabago 'yan (Actually, the other day, it was already 50-50. The figure changes),"" Solidum said, cautioning against getting ""trapped"" in focusing on the percentage. Amid the volatility, Alert Level 4 remains in effect and areas within a 14-kilometer radius from Taal are still extremely vulnerable. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far) How does Phivolcs calculate probabilities? ""We look at the monitoring parameters that we have and binibigyan namin ng weight ito.... We have experts that provide their own opinion on what the data would be showing to us. Meron din tayong reference sa mga historical data that we have.... So kino-combine namin 'yan, at tinitignan namin maliban doon sa posibleng pagsabog, meron din kaming tinitignan [kung] ano 'yung mga distansiya na puwedeng abutin depende doon sa lakas ng pagsabog,"" Solidum said in a press briefing on Thursday morning. (We look at the monitoring parameters that we have and we give them corresponding weight. We have experts that provide their own opinion on what the data would be showing to us. We also use historical data that we have as reference. So we combine all of those, and aside from the possible hazardous eruption, we also look at the likely distance that the hazards may reach, depending on how strong it is.) ""Mataas 'yung 30% para doon sa nasa loob ng danger zone.... Delikado sila sa base surge (30% is high for those within the danger zone. They're vulnerable to a base surge),"" Solidum added. A base surge, one of the potential hazards during an eruption, is a ring-shaped, superheated cloud of ash, rock, and gases which could travel horizontally at high speed. It would destroy or kill whatever is in its path. (WATCH: Anxious villagers plead against lockdown of areas near Taal Volcano) So, what's the situation now? Solidum pointed out that ever since the first few days of the eruption, magma has been moving, as indicated by the volcanic earthquakes and ground deformation such as fissures or cracks. ""Remember, nandiyan na 'yung magma sa ilalim, and so ang tanong diyan, tutuloy pa ba siya o titigil muna siya?... Puwede siyang tumuloy, magkaro'n ng pagsabog na malakas, delikado sa mga tao. Puwede rin siyang tumigil na, at sana gano'n na.... At kung may panibago uli [na magma], kailangan naming bantayan.... Very complex ang mga volcano,"" he said. (Remember, magma is already there beneath the surface, and so the question is, will it proceed or will it stop rising? It can move up further, and there could be a hazardous eruption that would be dangerous for the people. It could also stop, and hopefully that's what will happen. And if there's fresh magma, we also have to monitor that. Volcanoes are very complex.) Maria Antonia Bornas, chief of the Phivolcs Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division, said they had thought last week that magma would already completely rise to the surface, hence the danger was higher. ""But now, nando'n lang siya sa ilalim ng bulkan at maraming puwedeng mangyari.... So ngayon babantayan natin 'yung kung ano'ng gagawin nung nakaipon na magma doon,"" Bornas said. (But now, it's still beneath the surface and many things could happen. So now we have to monitor what will happen to the accumulated magma there.) Phivolcs has been emphasizing that trends or patterns need to be established before the alert level can be downgraded. ""When we look at things, we have to look at what will happen in the next several days.... 'Pag nag-a-analyze po ng volcano...kailangan mong tignan 'yung overall, kung ano'ng proseso nangyayari sa loob ng bulkan (When you analyze a volcano, you have to look at the overall picture, at the processes happening inside the volcano),"" Solidum said. What were monitored in the past 24 hours? Phivolcs said it observed ""weak to moderate emission of white steam-laden plumes 50 to 500 meters high"" from the main crater. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission, meanwhile, was measured at an average of 141 tons per day, generally decreasing for 3 days now. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. Despite the decrease in SO2 emission, however, Phivolcs remains cautious since it is possible that the volcano's vents are just blocked, preventing the gas from being released. Like SO2, the number of volcanic earthquakes has begun to go down, but Solidum explained that the energy of these earthquakes is another factor to consider, checked through what is called ""real-time seismic amplitude measurement."" Phivolcs is using two networks to monitor the number of volcanic earthquakes – the Philippine Seismic Network which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former. The Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 731 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12, when the Taal unrest began. Of these, 176 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. From 5 am on Wednesday, January 22, until 5 am on Thursday, there were 6 volcanic earthquakes plotted at magnitudes 1.5 to 3.4, with no felt event. The Taal Volcano Network, meanwhile, recorded 467 volcanic earthquakes – including 8 low-frequency earthquakes – just in the past 24 hours. According to the United States Geological Survey, low-frequency earthquakes ""are caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface."" If a hazardous eruption occurs, Alert Level 5 – the highest – would be raised. This may or may not happen, leading to an agonizing wait for tens of thousands of families whose homes and livelihood are hanging in the balance.

But as the new footage shows, things are not all rosy Covinsky-land – Lara Jean is uneasy because of all the girls who are after her boyfriend, and, in seemingly perfect timing, she gets a letter from another one of all the boys she's loved before: John Ambrose McClaren (Jordan Fisher). John, who received the old love letter Lara Jean wrote him when she was younger, turns up in her life and they end up volunteering together. And because John is every bit as adorable as Peter K, Lara Jean is torn between a potential new romance, and her current love.

Despite the sudden departure of 7-foot-2 NBA prospect Kai Sotto mere days before the tournament kicked off, the Charles Tiu-coached squad is still filled to the brim with talent – rising stars and grizzled veterans alike. Beefing up Mighty’s frontlines are former NBA veterans Andray Blatche and Renaldo Balkman, PBA bruiser Beau Belga, high-flying Fil-Am Jamie Malonzo, PBA Rookie Draft 1st overall pick Isaac Go and developing sharpshooter Javi Gomez de Liaño. The rest of the squad seemingly has no holes either as young stars such as Thirdy Ravena, Dave Ildefonso, Mikey Williams, Juan Gomez de Liaño and import Jelan Kendrick lead the wing and guard spots. Veterans Gab Banal and Joseph Yeo are also there to provide valuable leadership in the second unit, which includes Jarrell Lim and Joaqui Manuel to round out the squad. Game time is 7 pm in Dubai (11 pm, Philippine time). The Philippine bets' level of talent should be able to match up very well against a feisty UAE national team, the 121st-ranked team in the world. Not to mention that Mighty will have the full force of excited OFW fans on their side, essentially turning UAE's home court advantage against them. Coach Tiu and lead assistant Ty Tang will have their hands full figuring out how their stockpiled talent will play as one cohesive unit against a UAE side already familiar with one another for years. Will Mighty’s talent be too much for UAE or will the tournament hosts give the Philippine team a rude welcome? Follow Rappler's live updates here. New Collection - Curated tweets by rapplerdotcom  "

Following the eruption of the Taal Volcano that began on January 12, donations came pouring in for evacuees. (READ: #ReliefPH: Help communities affected by Taal Volcano eruption) But this also triggered another problem, as used plastic bottles and bags may start building up in evacuation centers. (READ: Why we can’t let our guard down on Taal Volcano) The Environmental Management Bureau of Calabarzon warned that donating a lot of bottled water may lead to a garbage disposal problem in the near future, especially if the eruption of the Taal Volcano and the consequent rehabilitation will take several months or years. Seeing the need to do their part to help those affected, many organizations championing the zero waste lifestyle started helping Taal eruption survivors by leading eco-friendly donation drives. Stans for a cause Among the organizations leading these eco-friendly donation drives is Hola, Roha – a group of stans dedicated to K-pop group Astro. Acknowledging that plastic usage should be minimized, they wrapped donated items in scratch paper bags and eco bags for the survivors of the Taal eruption. “Waste production has played a huge part in climate change,” Hola, Roha told Rappler. “We believe that taking care of the environment should start in our own ways.” Hola, Roha accomplished its first donation on January 21, giving away ready-to-eat food, blankets, medicines, and personal hygiene goods to the families affected.

Plastic pollution contributes to climate change, a disaster happens, more plastic is sent for relief,” said Beach Born president Sarah Tirona. “We were just troubled with the amount of single-use plastic going to relief centers which is why we decided to donate our shampoo bars,” she added. The business wasn’t alone in this endeavor. Beach Born supporters answered the company's call for donations, gathering both funds and relief goods for those affected. On January 15, Beach Born announced that 50% of its web sales and other monetary donations will be used to purchase feeds and other items needed by PAWS Philippines and Philippine Pet Birth Control Center Foundation (PPBCC) as they lead relief and rescue operations for affected animals. Beach Born  donated different goods, ranging from their own hygiene products like shampoo bars, to food and practical items such as beddings and masks.

By January 21, they were able to refill and reuse over 1,000 bottles and supported 4 relief operations for affected communities. “Bayanihan, malasakit, at pakikipagkapwa tao (Community cooperation, compassion, and charity) – all while being mindful of our impact to the environment. What we all did became part of an even bigger act of humanity by fellow Filipinos,” Casa de Lorenzo Organic Products said. Service to the environment is one of Casa de Lorenzo’s commitments. “Being socially responsible, especially to the environment, is among the prime considerations of our work because we source our livelihood from nature,” said founder Russell Lorenzo. “The bottom line here is we want to set an example to everybody to tirelessly keep on thinking of ways to be friendlier to our planet....

DILG Calabarzon OIC Elias Fernandez Jr relayed the order through an urgent memorandum addressed to DILG Batangas OIC Abigail Andres, and DILG Cavite director Lionel Dalope dated Wednesday, January 22. The DILG officials were instructed to relay the following instructions to concerned officials: Fernandez said business establishments located in the high-risk areas ""shall totally cease operations"" but added that mayors of local goverments ""outside the danger zone but within the 14-kilometer radius have the discretion to allow business operations without compromising public safety and interest.” The DILG earlier warned that it would issue show cause orders against mayors who would fail to implement the ""no window hour"" rule within the 14-kilometer danger zone from Taal Volcano. This was after some mayors allowed window hours and let residents retrieve valuables from their abandoned homes even after 11 Batangas towns were placed on total lockdown. In a briefing at Camp Vicente Lim in Laguna on Monday, Calabarzon police chief Brigadier General Vicente Danao Jr said the Philippine National Police together with the Armed Forces of the Philippines have proposed an exit plan for the remaining residents, including the relocation of security forces to the risk control points beyond the 14-km radius within 48 hours. Danao also instructed the Reactionary Standby Support Force (RSSF) to replace the over 1,500 search and rescue personnel initially deployed in the area so that they too can rest, while those directly affected may leave their base and extricate security equipment and mobilization. Alert Level 4 remains raised, which means a hazardous eruption could still occur ""within hours to days."" (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far) – Rappler.com "

Former Recording Academy President Neil Portnow denies accusations by Deborah Dugan, who was suspended after accusing the Recording Academy of putting her on leave for raising concerns about sexual harassment, voting irregularities and other misconduct. File photo by Robyn Beck / AFP Neil Portnow's denial comes one day after Deborah Dugan filed an explosive discrimination complaint against the Academy, which included the rape allegation, days after she was put on leave – and just before Sunday's Grammy awards. Dugan's bombshell 44-page filing with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in Los Angeles claims she was suspended after raising concerns of sexual harassment, voting irregularities and other misconduct within one of music's most powerful organizations. Portnow – who stepped down as CEO after 17 years at the helm, amid outrage over his controversial comments that women artists should ""step up"" to gain more recognition for their work – said Dugan's filing ""is filled with inaccurate, false and outrageous and terribly hurtful claims against me."" ""The allegations of rape are ludicrous, and untrue. The suggestion that there was [a rape] is disseminating a lie,"" read Portnow's statement, published in full on Rolling Stone's website. He also denied demanding a $750,000 consulting fee to stay on as a consultant, which Dugan alleges was a proposal up before the Academy's board. Dugan's filing dealt a major blow to the Recording Academy less than a week before the Grammys – music's biggest night of the year. Major nominees this time out include Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X. Dugan's assumption of her position in mid-2019 was meant to usher in a new era for the Academy, long dogged by allegations of promoting a music culture that was overwhelmingly white and male. But Dugan, the first woman to lead the Academy, says she was sexually harassed by prominent entertainment lawyer Joel Katz, a general counsel to the organization. She told the EEOC she sent an email on December 22 to the institution's human resources department detailing that accusation as well as ""egregious conflicts of interest, improper self-dealing by Board members and voting irregularities with respect to nominations for Grammy Awards, all made possible by the 'boys club' mentality and approach to governance at the Academy.""

Aala, Jr.","'There should be a seat reserved for the academe in our legislative house. No, not a party list, and not a consultancy, but an actual seat reserved for experts.'    Laws, and by extension lawmaking, requires information. Only when pertinent information is integrated with public needs can there be a proper law. Unwittingly, a vast majority of the laws in the Philippines either lack pertinent information due to external and internal communication barriers or does not extend fully to address public needs. As a researcher myself, our daily activities center towards the term optimization. Was the desired end product achieved? Were there steps that needed improving? As the information gatherers of our society, it is our role to provide the public a clear picture of what it is that we have elucidated. If we tell people that a man was the probable father of a child because we used 23 different short tandem repeats in our DNA to identify putative matches, the general public would not understand the importance of our work. But if we show them visual bands that match between father and child, then the story becomes easier to follow. Lawmakers are not scientists. The greater proportion of our leaders are not even familiar with Taq polymerase and why it has become so commonplace in science. Due to this, lawmakers have to accept that it is their task to gather information from those who have an entire lifetime’s worth of information regarding certain fields of science – our experts. Failure to do this will only lead to social pandemonium, as shown during the Supreme Court’s ban of Bt eggplant and GM products in 2015, which was then repealed in 2016. (READ: The SC kills Bt talong, and takes down Philippine science as well) Information sources – i.e. researchers, scientists, academicians – should not only be given plaques or national scientist titles, but must be heard and given a privileged position during lawmaking. Titles are not what drives our most passionate of scientists; it is dedication to our country. It is to my opinion that there should be a seat reserved for the academe in our legislative house. No, not a party list, and not a consultancy, but an actual seat reserved for experts. When we hear Filipino leaders mock the scientific community for asking for a bigger budget, they unwittingly cut off one of the critical factors in lawmaking, which is better quality information. Project NOAH, PHILVOCS, DA, DOH Dengvaxia – the signs are all there. The societal stigma resulting from this confusion has not aided the general public in being better informed. Instead it has become a Manichean system of being pro or against a political regime. (READ: 5 things to make PH a better place for scientists) The political system in the Philippines, and in the entire world for that matter, is always in constant flux because of differing political will between leaders. However, the scientific system has always been steadfast – it is self-correcting, it is peer-reviewed, and it is empirical in nature. Science does not favor one political regime over the other. It does, however, equip any political regime with the capacity to target each societal problem objectively. – Rappler.com Mr. Wilson F.

Jacques Francioly, 70, was found emaciated in a ravine in Sitio Sikling, Barangay Latang, and was rushed to the Barlig District Hospital. He will be transferred to the Luis Hora Memorial Hospital Thursday, January 23. On January 21, Edelwina Manonggit, manager of the Halfway Inn and Restaurant in Barlig, reported to police that Francioly had been missing since January 14. The French tourist checked in at the inn on January 13 and told a worker that he would go around sight-seeing the place. He didn't return. When Manonggit peeped into the window, she saw Francioly’s equipment still plugged in and some of his clothes still around. The police said Francioly was approached by some of the tour guides if he needed their services, but the French man told them he would be going to Natonin town instead. Upon the report of Manonggit, the police conducted a search and rescue operation on January 22 with the Barlig local government unit headed by Mayor Clark Ngaya, Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office, Bureau of Fire Protection, barangay officials of Latang, Barlig Municipal Police Station, Barlig Environmental Tour Guides Organization, and civilian volunteers.

Photo by Jeff Vinnick/Getty Images/AFP VANCOUVER, Canada – Protestors outside a Canadian courtroom pressing for the release of a senior Chinese telecommunications executive fighting extradition to the US were paid actors, they told local media. It was not clear, however, who footed the bill. A dozen men and women on Monday, at the start of the hearing considering whether or not to hand over Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou to US authorities to face fraud charges, held up red and white hand-written signs that read ""Free Meng"" and ""Trump stop bullying us."" They declined to speak to an AFP journalist at the scene. But later a handful were tracked down and spoke to Canadian media, saying they were paid Can$100 ($76) to Can$150 for two hours work that they had understood to be as extras in a movie shoot. The offer, they said, came through Facebook or acquaintances. ""A CBS reporter approached me and my friend and she started interviewing us. And it was in those moments and questions where I started realizing, OK, if this was background work, they wouldn't need detail on background people,"" Julia Hackstaff told public broadcaster CBC. After more journalists approached seeking comments, she said she realized that the movie she thought she was appearing in was in fact a very real event. ""I started realizing, wait, no one called 'action,'"" Hackstaff said. Another protestor, Ken Bonson, gave an identical account to the Toronto Star, saying she ""had no idea what I was going into."" ""I'm honestly pretty ashamed and embarrassed,"" she said, explaining that she had not known about Meng or her legal saga. Meng is wanted by US authorities for alleged fraud related to sanctions against Iran. The US alleges she lied to HSBC about Huawei's relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating US sanctions against Tehran. Meng has denied the allegations. Her extradition hearing is scheduled to last until Friday, then adjourn until a second phase scheduled for June.

The Ayala group faces another possible legal battle after Malacañang says it will review its lease contract from the UP-Ayala Land Technohub site. Photo from WikiCommons MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered a review of the lease contract for the UP-Ayala Land Technohub in Quezon City, following the recommendation of Chief Presidential Counsel Salvador Panelo. Panelo, who is also presidential spokesperson, made the announcement in a Palace news brieging on Thursday, January 23. He said Duterte agreed with his recommended review of the contract between Ayala Land and the University of the Philippines (UP) to check the document for possible ""onerous"" provisions. ""I told the President about this and 'yung reaction ng Presidente ay tingnan natin kung totoo 'yung alegasyon ng article na 'yun (and the President's reaction was let's see if the allegations of that article are true),"" Panelo told reporters in a press conference at Malacañang. Panelo was referring to an online article alleging that the Ayalas are renting the 37-hectare or 370,000-square-meter (sqm) land at only only P22 per sqm a month. Ayala Land has since said that it is paying P171 per sqm monthly. (READ: Malacañang’s rants send Ayala Land shares falling by 7%) ""We will investigate. We will review para malaman namin kung totoo o hindi (so that we know if this is true or not). In other words we do know exactly what,"" he said.

[I told him] the night before (Wednesday). Sabi niya kailangan talaga pag-aralan yan (He said we really need to study that),"" Panelo said. What will happen next? Panelo said it remained to be seen what recommendations would be made if indeed, questionable provisions would be found in the contract. Panelo said either the Department of Justice or the Office of the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel, which he heads, would review the contract. After this, it would seek the comment of the Department of Finance and the Office of the Solicitor General. ""Tingnan natin kung ano 'yung recommendation ng Department of Finance kasi involved ang pera (Let's see what the recommendation of the Department of Finance will be because it involves money).

Legal battles: The review of the UP-Ayala Land technohub lease contract is the latest in a series of deals being reviewed by the executive branch involving the Ayala group. The DOJ is already reviewing the alleged onerous concession agreement of Manila Water, which has sparked Duterte's outrage. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives is set to probe the deal of Ayala Corporation and Manny Pangilinan's Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC) for the Light Rail Transit Line 1. Renewed threats against government contracts with private entities are seen to spook businesses and investors, with experts emphasizing that the government's respect for the validity of contracts it enters into is an important factor in building investor confidence. Panelo belied their concerns, saying business had ""nothing to fear"" if there was ""nothing wrong"" with their contracts. ""The President will certainly respect the sanctity of contracts except only when from the very provisions it appears to be contrary to law, public interest, and public policy,"" he claimed.

314,250024,"January 24, 2020",IMHO,[OPINION] Dreaming of water: Thoughts on Metro Manila's water crisis,Maria Pia F. Luque,"'I can live without a man, but I cannot live without water'    Manang’s face was turning bright red, a shade that perfectly matched the full pail of water I was heaving with me in the market. Tired and famished, I had not bothered to ask about prices when I ate at her carinderia, and now she was demanding an unreasonable 200 pesos for a small plate of fish and rice. I refused to capitulate. Soon we would come to blows. As onlookers crowded around us, I knew I could not run off without spilling the precious water in my pail. To escape, should I leave the pail behind or throw the water out? Before I could decide, the sound of running water woke me. It was 3 in the morning; turns out it was just a bad dream. Half asleep, I got up, trudged to the bathroom and turned off the faucet as water pooled on the floor. My anxiety subsided, and happiness washed over me (water pun intended). It will be Valentine’s Day soon and almost a year since rotational water service interruptions began in Metro Manila. It is hard to feel love when life has not been the same since March, when water vanished from our apartment building. I quickly learned to eat different meals from the same unwashed plate, cram my refrigerator with dirty pots and utensils, wash my hands over an unflushed toilet, and bathe with 3 dips of a tabo. It is a blessing I live alone, without anyone to complain about my utter lack of propriety. At night, I go to bed grimy after skipping my typical evening shower. I leave the faucets turned slightly, with hope and a prayer that water would finally come. My fellow tenants and I, once strangers but now bonded over a common misery, would share great news by texting “May tubiggg naaa!” (punctuated by happy emoticons), or advice not to come home just yet, because “#$@&% Wala pa rin tubig!” If there was merely a trickle, we still deemed it good, despite the hours it took to fill a pail. If water flowed from the outdoor faucet installed by our kind landlord, we would lug basins, pails, and jugs to our third-floor studios. Filipinos take pride in being among the most resilient people on earth. We surmount natural disasters on a regular basis, yet it is difficult to be strong when we cannot even enjoy basic services. Most of us will never own homes or fancy cars, but we will certainly lead long, happy, and productive lives as long as we have sufficient water. With the water shortage causing relentless stress, images of water soon invaded my dreams. Once, I was transported back to a beach I had not visited since childhood, helpless and upset as swirling water formed a sea devoid of waves and of life. Even memories of past loves lacked that power to intrude my subconscious, though somehow this crisis feels a bit like falling in love. I do not just dream of water. I think about it all the time. Its unexpected arrival brings me joy and its sudden departure fills me with constant dread. Alone or with company, I am restless. I worry about whether I would be/have enough – water crucial for cooking, eating, drinking, surviving. At restaurants, I ask for take-home water in my 1-liter tumbler. It embarrasses a friend, but my desperation knows no shame. I can live without a man, but I cannot live without water. Indeed, water is both a resource and a necessity. This echoes a quote repeatedly shared online: “Once you carry your own water, you will learn the value of every drop.” In a time of uncertainty, while we rush to wash clothes at ungodly hours and keep saving grey water from baths and laundry, we unite in resilience and cling to a pipe dream that all will be well soon. With the shortage affecting all sectors of society, water has turned out to be the great leveler. If this is a test of patience and creativity, we all deserve top scores. Plus, our throats may be parched but the ground remains fertile for rich Filipino humor, a manifestation of our much vaunted resilience. “Paasa much,” a younger colleague jokes about a water concessionaire’s distribution schedules, which end up as broken promises. “It’s not you, it’s them! It’s complicated,” I counter with a laugh. – Rappler.com Maria Pia F. Luque teaches English at a private school.

The HRET upholds the victory of Northern Samar 1st District Rep Paul Daza in the 2019 elections. Photo courtesy of congres.gov.ph MANILA, Philippines – Paul Daza stays as the representative of Northern Samar’s 1st District in the 18th Congress. In a resolution dated December 12, 2019, but released to reporters over a month later on Wednesday, January 22, the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) upheld Daza’s victory over his opponent Harlin Abayon, whom Daza beat by 59,685 votes in the 2019 elections. Daza ran under the once-ruling Liberal Party, while Abayon was a Nacionalista Party candidate. The 9-member tribunal dismissed Abayon’s electoral protest “for being insufficient in form and substance.” Abayon had accused Daza, who was Northern Samar governor before running for Congress, of buying votes. Abayon then asked the HRET to annul the results in 5 out of the 14 municipalities in Northern Samar’s 1st District. The HRET argued, however, that even if the election results in the 5 municipalities were voided, Daza would still maintain a 22,810-vote advantage over Abayon. “[Assuming] the Tribunal annuls the election results in the foregoing 5 municipalities, after deducting the protestee’s margin of 36,875 votes from his total over-all margin of 59,685 votes, protestee will still emerge as winner by a margin of 22,810 votes,” the HRET said. The HRET also said Abayon identified only two witnesses for his vote-buying claim against Daza. THE HRET is composed by the following: It was not Abayon's first failed bid to return as Northern Samar 1st District congressman. In the 2013 elections, Abayon had beaten Raul Daza, Paul’s father, in the congressional race. But the elder Daza filed an election case with the HRET against Abayon for alleged electoral fraud in some clustered precincts. The HRET favored Daza at the time, forcing Abayon to bring the case before the SC. The High Court then reversed the HRET ruling and recognized Abayon as the duly-elected congressman in the 2013 elections. But the House of Representatives, then led by Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr, did not allow Abayon to take his oath, claiming the lower chamber did not receive a copy of the SC ruling. – Rappler.com "

A woman holds a child wearing a face mask as they queue at the West Kowloon rail station in Hong Kong on January 23, 2020. Photo by Philip Fong/AFP HONG KONG, China – Hong Kong will turn two holiday camps, including a former military barracks, into quarantine zones for people who may have come into contact with carriers of the Wuhan virus, officials announced Thursday, January 23. The international financial hub has been on high alert for the virus, which has killed 17 people since the outbreak started in central China. The same sites were used as quarantine facilities during the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak 17 years ago. Nearly 300 people in Hong Kong were killed by SARS, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. So far two people in the city have tested positive for the new coronavirus – which is similar to the SARS pathogen. Both had visited Wuhan in recent days. They are being treated on isolation wards in hospital. The gambling hub of Macau, which is hugely popular with mainland tourists, also confirmed two cases this week. On Thursday, Macau's tourism bureau announced it was cancelling all official Lunar New Year celebrations in response. In Hong Kong, officials announced they would convert two holiday parks to isolate any potential cases while they await test results. ""We will have a full team of staff to operate the quarantine camps,"" Wong Ka-hing, the director of the Centre for Health Protection, told reporters. Wong said 3 people who had come into close contact with the two confirmed cases would be taken to a camp in rural Sai Kung district later Thursday. Another holiday camp, a former British military barracks on Hong Kong island, was being prepared to serve as a quarantine facility. Scarred by the past The 3 people are the wife of one of the confirmed cases and two medical staff, health officials said. Those who test positive for the Wuhan virus will then be treated in isolation wards at the city's hospitals, but the holiday camp quarantine zones will lower the risk of the virus spreading while people await results. The same system was used during the SARS outbreak, which dramatically transformed Hong Kong into a place where the population is now far more conscious of contagion and hygiene standards. Door handles, elevator buttons and escalator handles in the city's myriad skyscrapers and metro stations are routinely sterilized multiple times a day, while an unguarded sneeze on the crowded subway can cause neighboring commuters to scramble for distance. Surgical face masks are ubiquitous, not just in the winter flu season, with many shops selling out in recent days. Hong Kong's difficulties in battling SARS were compounded by the veil of secrecy that surrounded the outbreak on the authoritarian mainland. But officials insist they are more prepared than 2003 and say Chinese authorities are being much more transparent with data. Nonetheless, suspicion of the mainland remains high in Hong Kong, especially as it convulses with anti-government protests sparked by fears Beijing is eroding the city's unique freedoms. On Thursday, health officials were questioned by reporters as to why they weren't advising all arrivals at the city's high-speed train link with the mainland to fill out health declaration forms. ""We are now actively considering to extend the compulsory health declaration to cover the high-speed rail link,"" Wong said. He added that any decision to cancel Lunar New Year celebrations like Macau has would need to be taken by the government. Officials have also been criticized by opposition lawmakers for allowing relatives of the first confirmed case to travel on to Manila. Hong Kong's train operator MTR Corporation said it was no longer selling tickets to and from Wuhan. Local media reported long queues at the high-speed terminus on Thursday as passengers sought refunds. – Rappler.com  "

Chinese nationals arriving from Guangzhou, China are seen wearing face mask at the arrival area of Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 in Pasay City. Photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) assured the public that systems are in place in case the new coronavirus that has spread in China reaches the Philippines. DOH Undersecretary Eric Domingo told reporters on Thursday, January 23, that the health department is “fully prepared” and that protocols are in place if ever cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV are reported in the country. “It’s just a matter of activating the infrastructure we have ready,” Domingo said. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The health department is currently probing the case of a 5-year-old Chinese boy in Cebu City who tested positive for what the DOH called “non-specific pancoronavirus.” This means that he tested negative for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but may have been infected by any of the 4 mild coronaviruses known to infect humans or the new coronavirus that emerged in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019. The DOH is waiting for test results from an Australian laboratory to determine whether the boy indeed has 2019-nCoV. If he tests negative, he may be discharged from the hospital in Cebu, where he has been under observation since January 12. “The World Health Organization’s (WHO) position right now is that the virus is really going to spread. In fact, it has already gone to several countries; the international spread is no longer theoretical. ” Domingo said. If a case is confirmed and if the WHO declares the new virus an international public health emergency, Domingo said the DOH will proceed with guidelines it followed during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreaks in 2003 and 2014, respectively, but “with modifications” attentive to the new virus. This means other government agencies, including the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Bureau of Immigration, the Department of National Defense, among others, will be involved. More resources will also be directed to guarding airports and seaports and other points of entry into the country. Currently, the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) is on high alert, screening passengers of flights from China for symptoms like coughs, colds, sneezing, and difficulty breathing. South China Morning Post reported that 4 family members of a 39-year-old man found to be “preliminarily positive” with the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV traveled from Hong Kong to Manila Wednesday, January 23, via a Cebu Pacific flight. According to the airline, all passengers were screened by the BOQ upon arrival and none was held for further observation, which means no passenger exhibited symptoms of respiratory illness. Domingo reminded the public that persons would only be put under observation if they have a history of travel to Wuhan or of working at a hospital there, if they’ve had contact with anyone suspected of the virus, and if they show symptoms of respiratory illness. Health cards are also being issued to travelers from China. Domingo said they also plan to distribute flyers so travelers may know how to contact the DOH in case they start manifesting symptoms. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said that there were still “many blindspots” concerning the new virus, allaying fears that 2019-nCoV, which has caused 17 deaths in Wuhan, is certainly as threatening as the viruses that caused SARS and MERS epidemics years ago. Scientists have yet to identify the source of the 2019-nCoV, but there are reasonable suspicions that it may have come from a public seafood market in Wuhan that has been found to be selling wild animals. Health officials in China have also said the virus may be transmitted from person-to-person. As of Wednesday, January 22, there have been 555 cases reported in Asia and North America, with 444 of the cases all in Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease. Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, has been on lockdown as authorities scramble to control the spread of the disease. Flights from Wuhan have also been canceled since Thursday as ports of entry around the world ramped up their response to the threat. WHO is set to convene a council meeting on Thursday that would determine whether the current situation is an international public health emergency and would outline the steps for preparedness and response against the disease. – Rappler.com "
320,250030,"January 23, 2020",Tech News,Investigation points to Saudi prince role in Bezos phone hack,Agence France-Presse,"A video sent to the Amazon CEO by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman delivered the malware, according to a report by technical experts hired by Bezos  BEZOS. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman during the former's 2016 visit to Riyadh. Photo by Bandar Al-Jaloud/Saudi Royal Palace/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – Amazon chief Jeff Bezos's phone was likely infected by spyware hidden in a message from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, according to an analysis released Wednesday, January 22, prompting calls for an official investigation. A forensic analysis by technical experts retained by Bezos after a leak of his personal information in early 2019 suggested that the Bezos iPhone was compromised by ""tools"" procured by a close associate of the Saudi de facto ruler. The suggestion of the Saudi prince's role in the hacking prompted calls for further investigation by UN human rights officials looking into the October 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and contributor to The Washington Post, which is owned by Bezos. ""The alleged hacking of Mr Bezos's phone, and those of others, demands immediate investigation by US and other relevant authorities,"" UN Special Rapporteurs Agnes Callamard and David Kaye said in a statement in Geneva. Any investigation should also look at the ""continuous, multi-year, direct and personal involvement of the Crown Prince in efforts to target perceived opponents,"" they added. Callamard, the UN expert on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and Kaye, the expert on freedom of expression, said the latest revelation ""suggests the possible involvement of the Crown Prince in surveillance of Mr. Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, The Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia."" The technical experts hired by Bezos concluded ""with medium to high confidence that Bezos' iPhone was compromised via malware sent from a WhatsApp account used by Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman,"" said the report by FTI Consulting, first reported by the online news site Vice. Saudis call allegation 'absurd' Saudi authorities rejected the latest allegations. ""Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr Jeff Bezos' phone are absurd,"" the Saudi Arabian embassy said on its Twitter account. But FTI, which was retained by the security consultant hired by Bezos, Gavin de Becker, said its forensic analysis pointed to former Saudi court media adviser Saud al-Qahtani, part of Prince Mohammed's inner circle. Qahtani, who was sacked as a result of the internal Saudi investigation into the Khashoggi case, is widely believed to have played a role in the killing of the journalist and to have directed ""a massive online campaign"" against Bezos and his newspaper. The FTI report said Bezos and the Saudi royal exchanged phone numbers and communicated via WhatsApp after meeting at a Los Angeles dinner in April 2018. It said that a message to Bezos on May 1, 2018 contained a video attachment which the two men had not discussed, but which delivered the malware that allowed ""unauthorized exfiltration"" of data from the Amazon CEO's iPhone X. The outflow of data increased by 29,000% after that incident, according to the report. A failed blackmail effort Bezos, the world's richest man, announced in early 2019 he was the target of a blackmail campaign by the National Enquirer tabloid which threatened to publish lurid pictures of him and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez as he was moving toward divorcing his wife. In March last year, de Becker said he concluded that the hack and leak of the Bezos pictures were led by Saudi Arabia but did not specify which part of the Saudi government he was blaming for the hack. According to a message to Bezos in February 2019 cited in the FTI report, the Crown Prince denied any involvement in the hack. ""Jeff all of what you hear or told.. it's not true,"" the message said. ""You know the truth, there is nothing against you or amazon from me or Saudi Arabia."" The analysis also suggested that the hackers may have used a type of spyware used in other Saudi surveillance cases, such as Pegasus-3 malware developed by the Israeli security firm NSO Group. The Israeli firm said in a statement it was ""shocked and appalled"" by the reports linking its software to the Bezos phone hacking. ""If this story is true, then it deserves a full investigation by all bodies providing such services to assure that their systems have not been used in this abuse,"" the company said. ""Just as we stated when these stories first surfaced months ago, we can say unequivocally that our technology was not used in this instance."" – Rappler.com "

Williamson, who was the number one overall draft pick in June, offered a tantalizing glimpse of what's to come in his career when he exploded for 17 points in little more than 3 minutes in the 4th quarter before finishing with 22. The 19-year-old sensation had been sidelined since arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on the eve of the Pelicans' season-opener in October. He made a tentative start, scoring just 5 points with 4 rebounds, 1 assist, 4 turnovers in less than 12 minutes on the floor over the first 3 quarters. With 8:52 remaining and the Spurs up 99-91, Williamson connected with a three-pointer from the top of the key that ignited the crowd of 18,365. He followed up with an alley-oop layup, fed by Lonzo Ball, drained a trey and put back his own miss with a spinning layup before adding two more three-pointers. The crowd was chanting ""M-V-P!"" as he capped the burst with a free throw, but he was soon subbed out of the game as Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry stuck to the plan of playing Williamson only in short bursts.

""I think there's a really, really high ceiling that he can reach, and he can reach it soon,"" added Gentry, who nevertheless was impervious to the cries of ""We want Zion"" from fans late in the 4th quarter. ""It was very hard,"" Williamson admitted of coming out of the game just as he had found his rhythm. ""I'm 19. Honestly, in that moment I'm not thinking about longevity I'm thinking about winning that game. ""So it was very tough,"" added Williamson, who finished with 22 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists. The Spurs, who led by as many as 15 and by 12 to start the 4th quarter, were up 109-108 when Williamson departed and quickly pulled away again. LaMarcus Aldridge led the Spurs with 32 points and DeMar DeRozan added 20 for a San Antonio team holding down the 8th and final playoff spot in the West. Williamson, who admitted on Tuesday he wasn't sure just how much sleep he'd get on the eve of his debut, said that as the pre-game introductions were made he just told himself to ""be calm."" 'Great stuff' He said it wasn't just Gentry who urged him at halftime to defer less but also teammates including Jrue Holiday. ""I think he did well,"" Holiday said, commending the teenager's poise.

Joining him as guests of honor and speakers were presidential adviser on the peace process Secretary Carlito Galvez, newly installed Philippine National Police (PNP) Direcor General Archie Francisco Gamboa, and Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) Director Charito Plaza. Sermonia explained that JIPCO is a community relations program of the PNP in partnership with PEZA that is “generally the first line of defense from radical labor infiltration of the labor force and the industrial zones in support of ELCAC (End Local Communist Armed Conflict).” “With its slogan 'Together, we drive the force of our country’s global competitiveness and foreign preference as an investment destination', JIPCO was created for purposes of protecting both labor welfare, labor rights, and productive industry gains, without sacrificing industrial peace.

Photo by Alexey Nikolsky/Sputnik/AFP JERUSALEM, Undefined – Israel hosts dozens of world leaders Thursday, January 23,  to mark 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, the World War II death camp where the Nazis killed more than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews. The presidents of Russia, France and Germany, US Vice President Mike Pence and Britain's Prince Charles were set to address the somber event at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem in the presence of Auschwitz survivors. Guarded by more than 10,000 police, one third of the national force, the meeting of more than 40 presidents, premiers and monarchs is the biggest international diplomatic gathering ever held in Israel. Alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the leaders will warn against a resurgence of anti-Semitism in speeches at the memorial center for the 6 million Jews that Nazi Germany killed in gas chambers, ghettos and forced labor camps. ""This is a historic gathering, not only for Israel and the Jewish people, but for all humanity,"" Israeli President Reuven Rivlin told a dinner on the eve of the commemoration. ""As we remember the victims of the Holocaust, and World War II, we also mark the victory of freedom and human dignity,"" he said, calling for a global push to ""stand united in the fight against racism, anti-Semitism and extremism"". The ceremonies move on next Monday to the site in Poland of the Auschwitz camp, liberated by the Soviet Red Army on January 27, 1945. While the focus in Jerusalem will be on the Holocaust and its haunting legacy, modern politics have impacted the event, held at a time of soaring US-Iranian tensions and ahead of Israel's March general election. Netanyahu this week drew a direct link between the Nazis' ""Final Solution"" to exterminate Europe's Jews and the threat that Israel says it faces from its arch-foe Iran. While in the Nazi death camps, ""a third of the Jewish people went up in flames"", today ""Iran openly declares every day that it wants to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,"" he said. ""I think the lesson of Auschwitz is: one, stop bad things when they're small. And Iran is a very bad thing, it's not that small, but it could get a lot bigger with nuclear weapons."" Tehran strongly denies all accusations of anti-Semitism, insisting that while it opposes the Jewish state and supports the Palestinian cause, it has no problem with Jewish people, including its own Jewish minority. 'Memory of victims' Netanyahu enjoys strong backing from US President Donald Trump, who in 2018 pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and has heaped sanctions and ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran and ordered the targeted killing of a top Iranian general on January 3. In his talks with Pence, who arrived early Thursday, Netanyahu was expected to seek reaffirmation of Washington's support for Israeli settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian territories and on other contentious issues. One of the most powerful players in Jerusalem will be Putin, a key actor in the Middle East since his forces, along with Iranian fighters, started backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015. The commemorations were organized by Moshe Kantor, a billionaire close to the Kremlin who is also a prominent figure in Russia's Jewish community and the president of the European Jewish Congress. Putin, who is travelling with his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, will give a key speech, but Poland's President Andrzej Duda is staying away after being denied the right to address the event. Relations between Moscow and Warsaw, its Cold War-era satellite, have been strained since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014, and have deteriorated further in disagreements over history. Last month, Putin provoked an outcry after he made the false claim that Poland had colluded with Adolf Hitler and contributed to the outbreak of World War II. Poland, which sees Moscow as rewriting history and ignoring its own 1939 non-aggression pact with Hitler, has urged Putin ""not to use the memory of the victims of the Holocaust for political games"". While in Jerusalem, Putin will inaugurate a monument to honor victims of the Nazis' siege of Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg, that left hundreds of thousands of people dead, including an estimated 70,000 Jewish soldiers. For Israel, the commemoration comes at a time of political paralysis, when voters face a third general election in less than 12 months on March 2. Polls indicate Netanyahu, the caretaker premier, and his centrist rival Benny Gantz are still neck-and-neck – potentially leaving both unable, again, to form a majority government. – Rappler.com  "

The DSWD Listahanan is used for its 4Ps program to provide educational opportunities and health services through cash incentives. Photo by Leanne Jazul/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – In the last quarter of 2019, 54% of families considered themselves poor, according to the latest Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey. That result of the survey conducted in December was 12 percentage points above the previous mark of 42% in September 2019. The SWS said that 54% translated to around 13.1 million self-rated poor families in December 2019. In September that year, it was at 10.3 million. The latest figure leaped to its highest in over 5 years, when the self-rated poverty rate climbed to 55%  in September 2014. The December 2019 figure was a jump of 3.6 million more families who considered themselves poor from the ""record low"" first quarter survey conducted just at the beginning of previous year.. However, despite that leap in the last quarter, the annual average of self-rated poverty in 2019 declined at 45%, compared to the 48% in 2018. The self-rated poverty rates among families in the last quarter of 2019 are:  67% in Visayas, 64% in Mindanao, 47% in Balance Luzon, and 41% in Metro Manila. How much they would need The self-rated poverty threshold (SRPT) – the minimum monthly budget poor families need for home expenses not to be poor – had a median value at P12,000 in 2019. The families were also asked how much they lacked (“Magkano pa po ba ang kulang ninyo sa ngayon?”) compared to their SRPT. The result would refer to the self-rated poverty gap (SRPG). The median SPRG was P5,000 in December. In the past, the median SRPG was normally half of the median SRPT. Since the median SRPG is at P5,000 compared to the P12,000, this means that the poorer half of the poor lack half of what they need for survival. 'Newly' poor families Out of the 54% self-rated poor families, 7% considered themselves ""newly poor"" (non-poor 1-4 years ago), which translated to 1.6 million families. Another 7% felt they were ""usually poor"" (used to be non-poor 5 or more years ago), which is 1.8 million families. The remaining 40% always considered themselves poor, which translated to 9.7 million families. The survey also looked at self-rated non-poor families. In that category, 6.3 million families believed they used to be poor, while 5 million families say they never experienced poverty. Food poverty The December survey found an estimated 8.6 million families who described themselves food-poor, this increased by 1.5 million families since September. However, the self-rated food poverty rate declined in its annual average at 31% in 2019 and 33% in 2018. The self-rated food poverty threshold (SRFPT) – the minimum monthly food budget poor families need in order for their food to not be poor – had a national median at P5,000 in December.  By area, the median SRFPT in Visayas was P6,000, followed by P5,500 in Balance Luzon, and P5,000 in Mindanao.  – Rappler.com "

More than 400 nursing mothers join the 'Breast Milk Ko, Alay Ko' event in Taguig City on January 23, 2020, for the benefit of evacuees affected by Taal Volcano. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Over 400 nursing mothers donated their breast milk for babies affected by the Taal Volcano eruption during an event in Taguig City on Thursday, January 23. This comes amid calls for donations for the over 140,000 people still in evacuation centers after Taal Volcano, located in the province of Batangas, started erupting on January 12. The Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Science and Technology reminded the public that only breast milk – not formula milk – may be donated to evacuees. This is to avoid diarrhea, as formula milk would require clean water which may not be readily accessible in evacuation centers. As part of post-disaster efforts, the DOH has deployed support groups that consist of counselors who talk to distressed mothers and gradually convince them to breastfeed their children. This is because mothers with post-traumatic stress may find it difficult to breastfeed like they usually do. Based on DOH standards, infant formula milk should be considered the last resort in post-crisis and disaster situations, meaning they should only be given when there is absolutely no breast milk or wet nurses available. Infant formula milk, if used, must also be centrally prepared by health and nutrition workers. The DOH has administrative orders (AOs) detailing guidelines for milk donation in disaster-hit areas. DOH AO 2005-0014 says that ""donations of breast milk substitutes, feeding bottles, teats, and commercial baby foods should be limited, if not refused."" Bottles and teats should also not be donated or distributed, as cup feeding is the preferred method. Meanwhile, DOH AO 2016-0004 states: ""Infant formula, breast milk substitutes, feeding bottles, artificial nipples, and teats shall not be items for donation. No acceptance of donation shall be issued for any of the enumerated items."" – Rappler.com To know more about how you can donate to Taal evacuees, read #ReliefPH: Help communities affected by Taal Volcano eruption.

Isa Molde and the UP spikers hope to get past the UAAP eliminations in their final year. Photo by Michael Gatpandan/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The veterans of the University of the Philippines women’s volleyball team are set to return for the upcoming UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournament, a source in UP management confirmed to Rappler on Thursday, January 23. Isa Molde, Tots Carlos, Jessma Ramos, Justine Dorog, Rem Cailing, and Maristela Layug will see action in their final year as UP aims for a return to the Final Four, the source said. After UP's disappointing run last year, Molde and several veterans had said they're unsure if they'd suit up in their final year of eligibility. UP finished Season 81 with a 6-8 record and missed the semifinals for the third straight season. Despite signing on to play for their respective teams in the Premier Volleyball League (PVL) and the Philippine Superliga (PSL) after the end of their last UAAP campaign, the veteran players agreed to return for another go in the collegiate level following a turbulent offseason which saw UP lose its biggest sponsor, United Auctioneers. Currently, Nowhere To Go But UP – the same foundation that flipped the fortunes of the UP men’s basketball team – is providing strategic management and oversight of the volleyball program, along with help from donations provided by Isko alumni. Professor Schedar Jocson of UP’s Filipino department has been named as the new team manager. New name One of the guidelines that the UP administration has set is that the team manager is required to be part of the UP system, in order to promote accountability for the program. “We don’t want to raise expectations, but we’ll be there fighting even with our limited resources,” said the source, who called UP’s upcoming campaign a “rebuild” for the program. As for potential new sponsors, “talks have been ongoing"" but ""there’s no agreement yet.” Furthermore, the UPWVT will no longer be called the Lady Maroons, and will now also be referred to as the Fighting Maroons. Molde, Carlos, and company committed to return as early as November last year, after one of the team’s senior advisors requested they do so in order to rally the UP community around the volleyball team in these trying times. “’We would like to have a good campaign this coming season, and we would like you to be part of it,’” was the text message sent to each of the veteran players. Not long after, a meeting was held wherein they agreed to come back. “They will be doing this for UP,” said the source, who added that will be the rallying cry of the team this UAAP season. “[They had] no qualms about it. They want to play again for the community.” With head coach Godfrey Okumu calling the shots, the Fighting Maroons are currently going through their preseason training camp in Osaka, Japan, where a pool of 22 players are present. Another factor which led to the return of the veteran standouts was the desire of management for them to pass on their knowledge to the younger recruits in the program. The management also hopes the Fighting Maroons can establish dedicated fan support similar to the type of encouragement the men’s basketball team has received in recent years. The UP spikers are set to return to the country next week, and then will begin final preparations for UAAP Season 82 that kicks off on Saturday, February 15. – Rappler.com  "

""I just received an invitation to go to the United States together with the ASEAN leaders. I haven't been to the States. I was invited by [former US President Barack] Obama, but I did not [go],"" Duterte said. Asked if he would attend the special summit between the US and ASEAN, Duterte then answered, ""No, no."" Back to Obama: In refusing to attend the special summit in March, Duterte harked back to his tumultuous relationship with Obama, who was critical of Duterte's war on drugs. Duterte said while he wanted to make friends, he would not forget the former US leader's remarks against him. ""One time, when I was being criticized by Obama in a press conference, he should have realized I was also a head of sovereign state. He should have criticized me in the proper venue,"" Duterte said. The Philippine President was referring to a September 2016 press conference, where Obama urged Duterte to conduct his drug war ""the right way,"" as thousands were being killed through extrajudicial means in relation to his drug war. The criticism, along with Washington officials' concerns involving the Philippine President, prompted Duterte to curse Obama. It came to a head with Obama cancelling a meeting with Duterte at an international summit in Laos in early September 2016. ""He should have brought the case to the United Nations rather than castigate a president of another country in a press conference. So I got mad. So I said a lot of cuss – I said you son of a -----, I said you're a son of a -----,"" Duterte recalled to RT News.

The US visa of Senator Ronald Dela Rosa, who was the architect of Duterte's bloody drug war during his stint as former chief of the Philippine National Police, has been cancelled.

(READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far) “May makapal na usok po. Maitim sabi ko may nasusunog ata. Hindi pumutok daw ang bulkan. Tapos mga alas kwatro na may ashfall.

But others said Taal Volcano erupted. There was an ashfall past 4 pm. They advised us to evacuate, but why should we leave when it was only ash?) Balina and her family lived in a small nipa hut in Talisay which is within the 14-kilometer danger zone. Balina said that when Taal Volcano started spewing ash that Sunday afternoon, she immediately thought of her ailing father, a survivor of 3 strokes, and her 14-year-old deaf-mute daughter Rosalyn Lamano. “First time kong na experience ito at hindi ko alam ang gagawin. Naramdaman namin ang lakas ng lindol. Hindi ko alam kung paano ko maililikas ang may sakit kong tatay dahil hindi na nga siya makalakad,” said the 39-year-old Balina. (This was the first time I experienced this and I really didn’t know what to do. We felt the strength of the earthquake. We didn’t know how to evacuate my ailing father because he could barely walk.) Balina said she asked her partner, Eric Lamano, 37, to stay by her side when a series of earthquakes shook the ground. That was the time they decided to evacuate. But the problem didn’t end there. Because of Rosalyn's disability, Balina had a hard time explaining to her daughter that they needed to move fast and evacuate their home. “Kinalabit ko siya, sabi ko, takbo! Tapos naka nganga lang  siya. Sabi ko naulan, tapos titingin lang siya. Tinuturo ko sa kanya ‘yung balikat niya. Sabi niya, bok bok. Ibig-sabihin alikabok. Sabi ko magtakip ng bunganga, nagtakip siya. Tapos nakatunganga lang ulit siya,” recounted Balina. (I tapped her, and said, run! She just opened her mouth. I told her it was raining, she would just stare at me. I pointed at her shoulder, and she responded ‘bok bok.’ It means ash. I told her to cover her mouth, she followed. Then she was just staring again.) They were rescued by their neighbors who helped them lift the ailing father to a safe place, while the couple took charge of carrying Rosalyn. None left for them After surviving the catastrophe, the couple now worry over how can they get their lives back. Their main source of living was fishing. But now the waters surrounding the Taal Volcano continue to dry up. “Nawala ang lahat. Wala na kaming babalikan. Na washed out na ang kabuhayan namin,” Lamano said. (Everything was gone. Our livelihood was washed out.) Lamano appealed to the government to help them bounce back. “Ang hiling po lang sana namin ay matulungan nila kami na makapagsimula muli. Dalawang linggo na kami rito sa evacuation centers at nag aalala na kami kung anong magiging buhay namin pagkatapos nito,” Lamano said. (Our wish is for them to help us rebuild our lives. We have staying here at the evacuation center for two weeks, and we worry what our life would be after this.) As of Thursday, January 23, Alert Level 4 is still  raised over Taal Volcano. State volcanologists say that a major explosion may come within hours, days, or even months. Many residents living within the 14-kilometer danger zone surrounding the restive volcano are uncertain as to what the future holds for them.

File photo by Miguel Riopa/AFP) LUANDA, Angola (UPDATED) – Isabel dos Santos, the tycoon daughter of Angola's former president, has been charged with money laundering and mismanagement, Angolan prosecutors said, as they launched a bid on Thursday, January 23, to have the billionairess and other suspects return home for questioning. One of five named suspects, a Portuguese banker identified at the weekend in a worldwide media exclusive dubbed the ""Luanda Leaks,"" has been found dead in Lisbon, police there said. The eldest child of ex-president Jose Eduardo dos Santos is the target of an anti-graft campaign led by her father's successor, Joao Lourenco. ""Isabel dos Santos is accused of mismanagement and embezzlement of funds during her tenure at Sonangol,"" prosecutor general Helder Pitta Gros told a news conference late Wednesday, referring to Angola's state-owned oil giant. ""(She) is thus charged in the first instance with crimes of money laundering, influence peddling, harmful management ... forgery of documents, among other economic crimes."" Gros said dos Santos was among 5 suspects, all of whom were currently residing abroad. ""At the moment, the concern is to notify and get them to voluntarily come to face justice,"" said Gros. Gros travelled to Lisbon after his announcement and was expected to meet his Portuguese counterpart later Thursday. Dos Santos is accused of using her father's influence to steal millions of dollars from the oil- and diamond-rich but poor southern African country and stashing it abroad. Investigations into her 18-month tenure as Sonangol head began after her successor Carlos Saturnino raised the alarm about ""irregular money transfers"" and other suspect procedures. The so-called ""Luanda Leaks"" trove of more than 715,000 files, published on Sunday by some of the world's top media outlets, suggest the alleged looting was systemic. The mounting scandal has stoked scrutiny of Portugal and some of its major corporations, especially the bank Eurobic. Eurobic banker Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, who was named in the ""Luanda Leaks"", was found dead in Lisbon, police said Thursday. ""All indications point to suicide,"" a police spokesman told AFP. Just hours earlier, Eurobic said in a statement that Dos Santos – who owns 42.5% of the bank – had taken the decision to ""withdraw"" as a shareholder. Dos Santos denial Dos Santos has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and denounced the investigations as politically motivated. The 46-year-old businesswoman has been furiously defending her empire, claiming her fortune was built on nothing but hard work and fruitful investments. ""This is what I do!,"" she tweeted on Monday. ""I build companies and enterprises, I invest and create jobs."" Angola's ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) said it respected the prosecutor's decision. ""The MPLA supports and encourages the continuing fight against corruption and impunity, which is a national imperative,"" spokesman Albino Carlos told AFP. Dos Santos has been dubbed ""the princess"" by many Angolans and Africa's richest woman by Forbes, which estimates her assets at $2.1 billion (1.89 billion euros). She stopped living in Angola after her father stepped down in 2017 for his anointed successor Lourenco. Most of the ex-president's family have moved abroad since he stepped down, and are believed to jet-set between London, Dubai and Portugal. Angola is still reeling from dos Santos's 38-year rule during which key positions were awarded to his cronies and wealth amassed  by a select few. Lourenco has vowed to crack down on corruption and launched a large-scale purge of the dos Santos administration. He removed Isabel dos Santos from her top job at Sonangol shortly after he came to power. Prosecutors last month froze bank accounts and assets owned by Isabel dos Santos and her Congolose husband Sindika Dokolo as part of the probe. Anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness alleged hundreds of companies, many based in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands, helped her ""to become Africa's richest woman while millions of Angolans live in extreme poverty"". – Rappler.com "

With just one tap, commuters who use the Light Rail Transit line in Manila will be able to donate funds for the survivors of the Taal Volcano eruption in Batangas.

As of Wednesday evening, January 22, the group had collected P15,000 from over 2,000 donors, with some tapping more than once. Raz said they were planning to deploy volunteers to other stations to amplify the campaign. “We want to eventually have all other schools in the South Manila consortium conduct their own donation drives in LRT stations nearest their school.

President of the International Court of Justice, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf (C) speaks during the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, on January 23, 2020 in the lawsuit filed by The Gambia against Myanmar in which Myanmar is accused of genocide against Rohingya Muslims. Photo by Robin Van Lonkhuijsen/ANP/AFP THE HAGUE, Netherlands (UPDATED) – The UN's highest court ordered Myanmar on Thursday, January 23, to do everything in its power to prevent the alleged genocide of Rohingya Muslims, as international justice stepped into the crisis for the first time. The International Court of Justice rejected arguments made by Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in The Hague in December and set out urgent steps for the majority Buddhist nation to end the violence. The mainly Muslim African state of The Gambia had asked the court to impose emergency measures following a 2017 military crackdown by Myanmar that sent around 740,000 Rohingya fleeing into neighbouring Bangladesh. Presiding judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf said that ""the court was of the opinion that the Rohingya in Myanmar remain extremely vulnerable"" and needed to be protected from further bloodshed. Thousands are suspected to have been killed in the crackdown and refugees brought widespread reports of rape and arson by Myanmar's military and local Buddhist militias. The court ordered Myanmar to ""take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts"" described by the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, under which Gambia brought the case. These acts included ""killing members of the group"" and ""deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part."" The court ordered Myanmar to report back within 4 months, and then every 6 months after that. It also told Myanmar to prevent the destruction of any evidence of crimes against the Rohingya. 'Historic day' The Gambia asked the court – set up after World War II as the UN's top judicial organ to rule in disputes between nations – for the measures pending a full case that could take years. Gambian justice minister Abubacarr Tambadou hailed the court's decision to uphold his country's case, which was supported by the 57-nation Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, Canada and the Netherlands. ""This is a historic day today, not just for international law, for the international community, but especially for the Rohingya,"" he told reporters outside the court. Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi – who was widely criticised for her defence of the same military that once locked her up for years – said on Thursday that some Rohingya refugees may have ""exaggerated"" the extent of the abuses. ""The international justice system may not yet be equipped to filter out misleading information before shadows of incrimination are cast over entire nations and governments,"" she wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial Times published ahead of the ruling. Suu Kyi also said Myanmar should have time to act on the results of an internal investigation by the country, which this week admitted war crimes may have been committed but ruled out genocide. The military dodged questions in the capital Naypyidaw on Thursday morning, with a spokesman telling reporters it would simply ""follow the instructions of the government"". 'First taste of justice' The result was also hailed in the Bangladeshi camps where some 600,000 people still remain. ""It's a great day for us,"" Mayyu Ali, a Rohingya author and poet, told AFP by telephone from Cox's Bazaar. ""When the international court made its ruling today, I felt the gate of justice had been opened. I have the first taste of justice."" Rights groups also hailed the ICJ ruling while calling on the international community to put pressure on Suu Kyi and Myanmar. Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, who was dressed in traditional Rohingya clothing, said outside court: ""The international community has to push to comply Burma with these provisional measures, otherwise (the) Rohingya will be much more destroyed."" ""Today’s decision sends a message to Myanmar’s senior officials: the world will not tolerate their atrocities,"" Amnesty International’s Regional Director Nicholas Bequelin said. The ICJ's orders are binding but it has no power to enforce them. However the ""significance... shouldn't be written off,"" said Cecily Rose, assistant professor in international law at Leiden University in the Netherlands. ""The court's orders and judgments tend to carry relatively great authority or legitimacy. Even though the situation in Myanmar is highly political and fragile, international law still plays a role by informing decision-making among international actors,"" she told AFP. – Rappler.com "

I'm giving the American government one month from now, President Rodrigo Duterte says  OUTRAGED. President Rodrigo Duterte escalates his tirades against the United States after it cancels Senator Ronald Dela Rosa's visa. Malacañang photo MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Following the United States' decision to cancel the visa of Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa, President Rodrigo Duterte renewed his threats to ""terminate"" the Philippines' Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the US. ""I'm warning you, this is the first time: 'pag hindi ninyo ginawa ang correction diyan, I will terminate the basis of Visiting Forces Agreement. Tapusin ko'ng putang inang 'yan,"" Duterte said on Thursday, January 23, during a speech in Leyte, where he distributed aid to former rebels. (I'm giving you this first warning: if you don't correct [what you've done], I will terminate the basis of the Visiting Forces Agreement. I'll end that son of a bitch.) His declaration was prompted by his anger over the cancellation of the visa of Dela Rosa, who was his first Philippine National Police chief and is known as the architect behind his bloody anti-illegal drug campaign. Dela Rosa had confirmed news his US visa was cancelled, saying Washington officials informed him he could apply for another visa if he wished. ""I'm giving notice. I'm giving the American government one month from now,"" Duterte said. Sought for comment, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters, ""I have to study the matter first before talking to him."" Can Duterte 'terminate' the VFA? The VFA, which took effect in 1999, outlined guidelines for the conduct of American troops visiting the Philippines. The agreement is the foundation for military exercises between the Philippines and the US. Duterte had threatened to scrap the VFA before. He did so in December 2016 after the US did not renew an aid package for the Philippines. ""They have to start to talk to us because they have to go. Bastos eh (They're insulting),"" Duterte said on Thursday. Senators said on Friday, January 24, there was no need for Senate concurrence to terminate the VFA. While Senate rarification was needed to make the VFA valid  – which the Senate did during the Estrada presidency – lawmakers said Senate action is not needed now to terminate the agreeement. The Department of Justice has been ""tasked to study the proper procedure to terminate the VFA,"" Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told reporters on Friday. ""We are doing it now,"" he added. Duterte retaliates: Duterte also threatened to deny entry to US senators who voted for a Senate resolution that seeks sanctions against Philippine officials involved in extrajudicial killings in relation to the Duterte administration's drug war and the detention of Senator Leila De Lima. ""Second, itong mga senador na nagboto sa resolution (these Senatros who voted for the resoltuion), I will not allow them to enter to the Philippines in addition to Senator [Dick] Durbin and 'yung lecheng – (and that despicable),"" Duterte said, referring to US Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, whose named he made fun of. US Senate Resolution 142 invoked the Global Magnitsky Act, which is the US' law that gives its executive branch the power to impose visa and travel restrictions and financial sanctions on human rights violators anywhere in the world. If sanctions are imposed, affected Philipine officials may be denied US visas and may have their bank accounts and assets in America frozen. US senators unanimously adopted the measure.

The latest death was that of a man whose body was found in a flooded river near Jorba, some 70 kilometres (45 miles) northwest of Barcelona, the emergency services said. Rescuers in Catalonia had been searching for a missing person in the same area but said it was too early to confirm if it was him. Catalan rescuers had late on Wednesday found another body of a man who died after falling into the water in Palamos, a port town about 100 kilometres up the coast from Barcelona. They are also searching for a man who went missing from a merchant ship in the same area, as well as a person in Cadaques near the French border. Earlier on Thursday, regional officials confirmed the death of a 75-year-old woman whose house collapsed because of heavy rain in Alcoi, a town in the eastern Alicante region. Storm Gloria hit the region on Sunday, bringing strong winds, torrential rains and heavy snow, battering Spain's southern and eastern flanks before moving north.

He had been busy distributing relief goods to their fellow evacuees, even as he looked after his own family's welfare.  GRIEVING. Jocelyn Salvia was grieving the death of her eldest child when her husband, Elmer, suffered a stroke and died more than a week since they fled the wrath of restive Taal Volcano. Screenshot from Rappler video BATANGAS, Philippines – All Jocelyn Salvia hoped for was to go home with her family to Talisay, Batangas, once Taal Volcano calms down. Their house is still there but Elmer, her husband, is gone. He had just returned to their evacuation home in Sto Tomas City, Batangas, at around noon on Tuesday, January 21, when he complained of a headache. He came from their house in Talisay – a town on lockdown because of the volcano – to clear it of ash. Elmer was about to take a nap when his phone rang. He was needed at the nearby gymnasium to sort out some relief goods. Elmer was his village's chief tanod or patrol, and even as evacuees, he saw to it that his neighbors had everything they needed. And so he got up and got the job done. When he got home afterwards, he asked Jocelyn for a drink of water. Moments later, he rushed to the sink and vomited. Jocelyn suspected it was a bout of hypertension, and she rushed to the store down the street to get her husband a can of pineapple juice. When she got back, she saw Elmer splayed on their beddings on the floor. Suppressing panic, she rushed to get help. She summoned their neighbors and the police at a nearby evacuation center to take Elmer to the nearest hospital. Doctors at St Frances Cabrini Medical Center were forthright about Elmer's condition. He had fallen into a coma. A vein had ruptured in his brain, and the blood had spread. If he survived, he would have been a vegetable. Jocelyn and her brother-in-law Elwin Salvia insisted on fighting for Elmer's life. Because there was no room at the hospital's intensive care unit, Elmer had to be taken to another hospital in Batangas City, about 48 kilometers away. It took hours before an ambulance became available, and it was close to midnight when they finally arrived with Elmer at the United Doctors of St Camillus de Lellis Hospital. He died in the wee hours of Wednesday, January 22. At least 3 other evacuees have died in the days following Taal Volcano's first massive emission of ash, though it is unclear whether their deaths were directly related to the phenomenon. ""Noon po 'yung lumipat po kami, siguro po ang asawa ko ay sa sobra na pong stressed, nag-aalala kung kailan kami ulit magsisimula pagbalik namin sa Talisay, siguro napagod din po siya nu'n sa panghihingi ng relief goods, 'yung paroo't parini,"" Jocelyn said as she told Rappler the story. (When we moved, perhaps my husband got too stressed, worrying about when we'd return and start over in Talisay, maybe he got exhausted then from asking around for relief goods, the coming and going.) The Salvias have been renting a single room in Sto Tomas City at a rate of P6,000 each month. Because Elmer's and Elwin's mother is frail, having survived a stroke 4 times, they could not risk living in evacuation centers. With no telling when Taal Volcano would let them return to their lakeside hometowns, the family has little choice but to put up with all their hardship. With Elmer gone, their future seems even bleaker. And then there are the bills incurred from Elmer's sudden sickness and death. The family still owes the Cabrini Hospital P47,000. For the coffin and funeral services, they owe Funeraria Velma P140,000. Rappler spoke with the management of Cabrini Hospital, a private institution. Medical Director Malen Gellido said that although they cannot waive the fee, they won't not force the bereaved to pay if they really could not afford to. However, it's their job to keep reminding the family of the balance. Funeraria Velma, on the other hand, agreed to give the Salvias a discount. The owner's wife, Gloria Luna Mangahis, explained that because Elmer was very tall, the only available coffin he could fit in was a premium one. Nevertheless, the family will only have to pay what they can, Mangahis said, which they can discuss after Elmer's burial. They're neighbors in Talisay after all, Mangahis added. It's the least they could do for Jocelyn and her family, who were still grieving the death of their eldest daughter in 2018 – and then Elmer passed away. Jocelyn still has a son to send to college, and two grandchildren from her daughter who died of lupus. How is she ever going to rebuild their lives in their home in Talisay? In the first place, can they ever go back? Taal Volcano still threatens to blow any minute, possibly unleashing a bigger catastrophe than what anyone has seen so far. But hopefully, there will be a reprieve for the Salvias. – Rappler.com Those who wish to give assistance to the Salvias may contact Jocelyn at +639303753230. "

Photo by Michael Gatpandan/Rappler  MANILA, Philippines – Alab Pilipinas ended its ASEAN Basketball League road trip on a high note with a nail-biting 77-76 win over Hong Kong Eastern at Southorn Stadium on Thursday, January 23. Fil-Am guard Jeremiah Gray once again showed his defensive wares as he blocked Jon Siu’s game-winning triple as time expired after Alab import Nick King blew an inbound pass in the last possession. It was a much-needed stop on Siu, as well, after the local swingman drained back-to-back triples in the final 4:35 of regulation to give Hong Kong its first lead at 72-71. Both teams then struggled to buy a bucket before King gave the lead back to the Philippine team with a layup in the final 67 ticks for the 77-76 lead. “I thought we missed some shots in the second half,” said head coach Jimmy Alapag after the game. “I thought they turned up the pressure defensively and they got rolling offensively and became a battle of the second half. It’s never easy to win a game on the road in the ABL.” It was a completely different story for Alab in the first half, however, as they erected an 18-point lead, 37-19, en route to a 45-30 gap by intermission. Hong Kong then erupted with a 23-7 run to start the 3rd as it inched within 3, 53-56, at the 2:54 mark. Brandon Costner then drained two triples to beat the 3rd quarter buzzer and to tie the game up, 63-all, at the start of the final frame. With the crucial win in the bag, Alab Pilipinas heads back home for a game against top-seeded Mono Vampire at the Caloocan Sports Complex on Sunday, January 26. The bounce-back victory moves the 6-3 (67%) Alab past the 9-5 (64%) Fubon Braves for 2nd place behind the 8-3 Thai-based Mono squad. King led the way for Alab despite the late blunder with 24 points and 7 rebounds on a 9-of-18 shooting while new import Prince Williams added 14 markers on a 3-of-4 shooting from downtown. Fil-Am playmaker Jason Brickman only mustered 2 points on a cold 1-of-9 clip but dished out a season-high 16 assists while the heroic Gray chipped in 11 markers, 5 boards, 5 dimes and 3 big blocks.

The COA Commission Proper, in a decision released January 6, affirmed a September 14, 2014, notice of disallowance and a June 14, 2016, ruling of the agency's National Government Sector-Cluster 2 that held the following SEC officials liable for the illegal expenditure: The COA in its ruling denied the SEC's petition for review, which sought the reversal of the 2016 ruling and the lifting of the disallowance. But COA exempted, based on good faith, other SEC executives and employees for being passive recipients of the increases. ""Public officials who are directly responsible for or participated in making the illegal expenditures shall be solidarily liable for their reimbursement,"" the COA said. State auditors had disallowed the increases in February 2013, citing the lack of approval from the Office of the President. It also questioned the way SEC used its retention income for the wage adjustment when, according to rules, the funds should be used to augment SEC's maintenance and other operating expenses as well its capital outlay. In response, the SEC claimed that it had assurances from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) that favorable recommendations were made to the Office of the President for the approval of the increases. The COA still issued a notice of suspension in September 2013, pending submission of the Office of the President's approval and a written authority from the DBM to use the retention income for the salary increases. The SEC was granted a 90-day extension in January 2014, but the COA later issued a notice of disallowance after the approval from the Office of the President was never submitted despite the extension. The COA also referred the case to the Office of the Ombudsman. ""In view of the apparent violation of laws, this case should be referred to the Office of the Ombudsman for investigation and filing of appropriate charges for technical malversation and/or other offenses, if warranted, against the officials responsible,"" the COA said. – Rappler.com "

He quit former prime minister Theresa May's government in 2018 in protest at what he viewed as her pro-European separation terms. Johnson returned as May's successor in July last year and has since managed to negotiate his own deal with Brussels and regain the government's control of parliament in a risky early election last month. The rest was a formality. Lawmakers barely debated the withdrawal agreement before passing it – even though critics called it worse for Britain than the one reached by May. Johnson will celebrate his victory by issuing commemorative coins and chairing a special cabinet meeting in England's pro-Brexit north on January 31. 'Absolute priority' Johnson will now be responsible for defining the terms on which Britain trades and shares everything from data to fishing waters with the remaining 27 EU member states. The formal talks are not expected to begin until March but the war of words is already intense. Johnson insists that he will not extend the end-of-year negotiation deadline, while Brussels says a comprehensive deal will take much more time. The UK government is also demanding the post-Brexit right to set its own rules on politically sensitive issues such as environmental standards and workers' rights. EU officials say that could give Britain an unfair advantage and are threatening to retaliate with tariffs and quotas that could do particular damage to the UK auto and pharmaceutical industries. But some analysts believe this is the price Johnson is prepared to pay for delivering on voters' wishes to ""get Brexit done"". He argues that this flexibility will help him reach a quick post-Brexit agreement with the United States and other nations that are growing much faster than the EU bloc. US officials say they are eager to strike a deal with Johnson. A deal ""is an absolute priority for President (Donald) Trump and we expect to complete that with them this year,"" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said ahead of his arrival in London this weekend. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross added that Johnson would have an easier time with Washington than Brussels because ""there are far fewer issues between the UK and US."" Johnson is expected to lay out his vision for the post-Brexit agreement with Brussels in a big policy address early next month. ""We'll be free to start having discussions with countries around the world, including the US"" at the same time as the Brussels talks, Downing Street said Wednesday. – Rappler.com "

Johnriel Casimero looks to avenge the loss of  Nonito “Filipino Flash” Donaire to Naoya Inoue. Photo by Alvin S. Go MANILA, Philippines – Expect a brutal slugfest when the unification title duel between Naoya “Monster” Inoue and Johnriel “Quadro Alas” Casimero happens on April 25 in Las Vegas. With negotiations between the two camps a “done deal,” ring pundits and fans are already drooling for what could be another Fight of the Year candidate. Inoue survived a tough challenge from Nonito “Filipino Flash” Donaire in Saitama, Japan last November, keeping the World Boxing Association bantamweight crown by unanimous decision in what was later chosen as 2019 Fight of the Year. While he remained unscathed after 19 bouts with 16 knockouts, the Japanese sustained an orbital fracture and got exposed as vulnerable to a power puncher with good defensive ability like Donaire. Casimero can also bring Inoue lots of trouble being a pressure fighter and relentless banger. The pride of Ormoc City showed he’s an elite fighter after disposing off South African Zolani Tete in 3 rounds in Birmingham, England to clinch the World Boxing Organization 118-pound title. According to reports, the camps of Inoue, who’ll be appearing in his first fight under the Top Rank banner, and Casimero, who’s representing MP (Manny Pacquiao) Promotions headed by international matchmaker Sean Gibbons, have “agreed to terms.” All that’s needed is for Top Rank honcho Bob Arum and Akihiko Honda of Teiken Promotions to sign the deal. The 30-year-old Casimero holds a 29-4 record with 20 knockouts, his last defeat occurring in 2017 against countryman Jonas Sultan. Since then, the southpaw has stopped his last 5 opponents. Right after his victory over Tete, Casimero called out Inoue, who hinted then he’s willing to fight Casimero next. Gibbons then went to Japan to hold talks with Arum and Honda. Now, Casimero-Inoue is in the offing, with the winner likely to figure in another unification against the victor between World Boxing Council champion Nordine Oubaali (17-0, 12 KOs) and Donaire (40-6, 26 KOs), who was designated mandatory challenger due to his strong performance against Inoue. – Rappler.com "

With a score of 34, the Philippines also ranked lower, falling 14 notches and placing 113th out of 180 countries. It was the country's lowest ranking since 2012. The country got the same score as El Salvador, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), and Zambia. In 2018, the country scored 36, and placed 99th among 180 countries.  HISTORICAL RANKING. Here's how the Philippines has ranked in the Corruption Perceptions Index since 2012. Each bar is normalized, taking into account the different number of countries in the CPI per year. Worldwide, Transparency International noted in its 2019 report that many nations ""are showing little to no improvement in tackling corruption."" The group then took note of the different protests around the world – from Chile to Czech Republic to Lebanon – where citizens marched ""to voice their frustrations in the streets."" They added that citizens are ""fed up with corrupt leaders and institutions."" ""The current state of corruption speaks to a need for greater political integrity in many countries. To have any chance of curbing corruption, governments must strengthen checks and balances, limit the influence of big money in politics and ensure broad input in political decision-making,"" the group recommended. Zooming in on the Asia-Pacific region, Transparency International noted that many countries ""see economic openness as a way forward,"" but many governments across the region ""continue to restrict participation in public affairs, silence dissenting voices and keep decision-making out of public scrutiny."" ""Given these issues, it comes as no surprise that vibrant economic powers like China (41), Indonesia (40), Vietnam (37), the Philippines (34) and others continue to struggle to tackle corruption,"" the group said. World rankings Denmark remained in the top spot, but it was joined by New Zealand in the 2019 index. Both countries obtained a score of 87. In the 2018 index, Denmark received 88 points while New Zealand got the same score of 87. Finland was in 3rd place in 2019 with a score of 86, followed by Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland, each with a score of 85 and tied in 4th place. At the other end of the spectrum, Somalia was deemed the most corrupt with a score of only 9, followed by South Sudan (12), Syria (13), and Yemen (15). Somalia, South Sudan, and Syria were also the 3 worst performers in 2018. The global average is 43, the same as in 2017 and 2018. Western Europe and the European Union remained the region with the best average score with 66, while Sub-Saharan Africa had the worst at 32. Their average regional scores were the same as in 2017 and 2018. The Asia -Pacific region had an average score of 45, followed by the Americas with 43, the Middle East and North Africa with 39, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia with 35. In its annual Corruption Perceptions Index, Transparency International scores countries and territories by their perceived levels of corruption in the public sector, aggregating data from various sources that provide perceptions by businesspeople and country experts. The CPI uses a scale where the higher the score, the least corrupt a country is: 100 is very clean, while zero is highly corrupt. – Rappler.com "

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin attends a session at the Congres center during the World Economic Forum in Davos, on January 21, 2020. Photo by Fabrice Coffrini/AFP DAVOS, Switzerland – The United States' financial chief on Thursday, January 23, told Swedish teen Greta Thunberg to go study before calling for a fossil fuel halt, prompting the climate campaigner to reply it doesn't ""take a degree"" to understand the science. The spat between US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Thunberg again highlighted the tensions over climate change at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, where governments have come under pressure to act on global warming as well as talk about the issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday also said in a keynote address that governments were obliged to act on the younger generation's concerns over climate change. Mnuchin had earlier advised Thunberg, who has been bitterly critical of US policy during her stay at Davos, to study economics before giving out lessons. Asked about the 17-year-old's demand for an immediate halt to investment in fossil fuels, he told reporters: ""After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us."" But in a  thread of tweets, Thunberg dismissed Mnuchin's comments in a typically withering response. ""My gap year ends in August, but it doesn't take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1.5 degrees carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don't add up,"" she wrote. ""So either you tell us how to achieve this mitigation or explain to future generations and those already affected by the climate emergency why we should abandon our climate commitments,"" she added. In her speech to the forum, Merkel said that older politicians had to use the ""positive manner and constructive impatience of young people"", who she said ""have a completely different horizon"" in terms of time. She did not however in her speech mention Thunberg, who other than Britain's Prince Charles has met relatively few top leaders at the forum. 'We want this done now' In a speech on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump had castigated the ""prophets of doom"" and those that predicted a climate ""apocalypse"", in comments widely seen as an attack on Thunberg who sat in the audience. (READ: Trump rejects climate 'prophets of doom' as Thunberg warns Davos) But either by accident or design, there was no meeting between Trump and Thunberg before the US leader left the Swiss ski resort on Wednesday declaring he would have ""loved"" to have met the climate activist, Time magazine's Person of the Year. Thunberg at the forum had repeated her climate warnings in sometimes withering terms, hammering home in a speech that it was time to ""panic"" because ""the house is burning"". Notably she had called for an immediate halt to investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction and an end to fossil fuel subsidies ""We don’t want these things done by 2050, 2030 or even 2021, we want this done now,"" she said. Thunberg is to hold a ""school strike"" demonstration in Davos on Friday. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, told AFP during the forum that governments were still failing to act on climate change. Attending the summit was like being at a ""crime scene where all of the criminals are right there in front of you,"" she said. ""But these are the targets.

Medical personnel wearing protective suits interact with two patients (R on bed and standing) tested positive to the coronavirus in an isolation room at Cho Ray hospital in Ho Chi Minh City on January 23, 2020. File photo by STR/Vietnam News Agency/AFP WUHAN, China – (UPDATED) China locked down some 20 million people at the epicenter of a deadly virus outbreak on Thursday, January 23, but the World Health Organization said the disease did not yet constitute a global health emergency. The respiratory virus has claimed 18 lives since emerging from a seafood and animal market in the central city of Wuhan, infected hundreds of other people and been detected as far away as the United States. The new virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. But after two days of talks to determine the level of global concern, the World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a so-called a public health emergency of international concern – declaration used for the gravest epidemics. ""This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. WHO had postponed its decision by a day, after Chinese authorities announced unprecedented measures to rein in the spread of the virus. China has effectively quarantined nearly 20 million people across Wuhan and other cities, and announced measures to curb the disease nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Lunar New Year holiday. 'End of the world' Beijing cancelled massive gatherings that usually attract throngs at temples during the New Year holiday, while the historic Forbidden City will close from Saturday. Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan were eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the major city of 11 million people, where most of the cases have been identified. Trains and planes out of Wuhan were indefinitely suspended and tollways on roads out the city were closed, leading to fear and panic for those who were trapped. ""We are feeling as though it is the end of the world,"" said one Wuhan resident on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, voicing concerns about shortages of food and disinfectant. Authorities in neighbouring Huanggang City also announced public transport and train services would be suspended at midnight, while people were told to not leave the city of 7.5 million. Ezhou, a city in Hubei province with a population of 1.1 million, announced the train station had been closed earlier in the day, while 3 other cities in the province announced restrictions on their public transport or roads. 'Effective and short' Tedros hailed China for taking ""measures it believes appropriate to contain the spread of coronavirus in Wuhan and other cities."" He stressed though that ""we hope that they will be both effective and short in their duration."" WHO emergency committee chairman Didier Houssin meanwhile told reporters that after receiving ""precise information"" from Chinese authorities, the health experts had determined that the travel restrictions were ""not directly related to a specific evolution of the epidemiology in the city."" More than 580 people have been infected with the virus across China – with most cases found in Wuhan, where a seafood market that illegally sold wild animals has been identified as the epicenter of the outbreak. China meanwhile confirmed Thursday the first death from the virus outside the epicenter, bringing the total number of deaths to 18. The health commission in northern Hebei province – which borders Beijing – said an 80-year-old man diagnosed with the new virus had died. The other 17 fatalities have all been people aged 48 to 89 and had pre-existing health conditions, Chinese health authorities said Thursday. The first case of the new virus was confirmed on December 31, and it has since been detected in Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. Singapore and Vietnam confirmed their first cases on Thursday. Spreading between people Animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak, with studies published this week suggesting the virus may have originated in bats or snakes. The WHO has confirmed that the new virus can be passed between people, at least those in close contact. Chinese health officials warned it could mutate and spread further. But Tedros stressed Thursday there was so far ""no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China."" If WHO had declared a global emergency, it would prompt countries to intensify their cooperation towards reining in the virus, including possibly on trade and travel restrictions – something the organization is not recommending for the time being. Countries have already increased efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen – known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – with thermal screening of all passengers arriving from China at airports in a number of countries. Several companies have also begun exploring developing a vaccine for the virus, with hopes that initial clinical trials could be carried out within months. Tedros meanwhile hailed China for quickly spotting the new virus and for its ""cooperation and transparency"" in sharing vital information about it with the international community. But a senior US State Department official said Washington was ""still concerned"" about transparency in the Chinese government. During the SARS epidemic, the Chinese government took months to report the disease and initially denied WHO experts any access. WHO's emergency committee stressed the need for international vigilance and information sharing, and recommended a new meeting in ""a matter of days to examine the situation further."" – Rappler.com "

The payment was given in 2016 to a private contractor using fake documents from the Commission on Audit (COA). The two other officials implicated are MMDA assistant general manager for finance and administration Edenison Fainsan, and chief accountant Ruth Diaz. Also held liable is trader William L. Tan, president of William L. Tan Construction (WLTC). Budget Division head Geraldine de Chavez was cleared of liability as the COA said she had no direct participation in assuring the payment complied with the law. In March 24, 2004, WLTC won the bid for a P199.8 million contract to design and build 15 steel pedestrian bridges. Based on its claimed work accomplishment, WLTC billed the MMDA P196.29 million. The MMDA paid P181.38 million, and withheld the remaining P9.05 million as retention money. They also deducated P5.86 million as liquidated damages for delayed completion of some structures. Upon post-audit, a Notice of Suspension was issued against the payments after COA noted inadequate support documents for the liquidations. A Notice of Disallowance was then issued. Appeals filed by the MMDA, plus the subsequent submission of the missing documents, resulted in the reduction of the disallowed amount to just P37.25 million – P18.15 million as liquidated damages and P19.1 million as contract variance. Further deducting the earlier retention money and the liquidated damage in the total amount of P14.91 million, the COA said only P22.34 million was left for those held liable to refund to the government. On April 28, 2016, Fainsan received in the mail a COA order dated February 10, 2016 that supposedly reversed the earlier affirmation of the disallowance and directed the release of P45.39 million to “William L. Tan Construction and Development Corporation.” The document was allegedly signed by the COA chair’s chief executive staff, and certified by a COA director. Diaz, however, held the processing of the payment pending submission of other supporting documents, which she then received on May 18, 2016 from Faisen with “Certified True Copy” stamps. A check worth P6,989,248.92 was then released to WLTC on June 1, 2016. In a memorandum dated June 23, 2016, however, the COA notified its supervising auditor that no such order was issued from the office of the chairman, followed by the issuance of a notice of disallowance for the check. An internal investigation was also launched to find the source of the fake document. Carlos and Diaz invoked diligence in the performance of their duties and claimed good faith regarding the validity of the document, but the COA dismissed these appeals. Carlos, according to the COA, should know that a decision is reversed or modified only by another decision or resolution and not by an ordinary order. “Clearly, his failure to exercise due diligence in the performance of his duty makes him liable for the disallowance,” the Commission Proper said. Diaz was in turn faulted for negligence in certifying the forged documents. “While she may not be expected to distinguish a genuine document from a spurious one, she should have required the submission of a copy of the ‘COA En Banc Decision’ being referred to in the order,” the COA pointed out. – Rappler.com "

The Doomsday Clock reads 100 seconds to midnight, a decision made by The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, during an announcement at the National Press Club in Washington, DC on January 23, 2020. Photo by Eva Hambach/AFP) WASHINGTON, USA – The Doomsday Clock on Thursday, January 23 ticked down to 100 seconds to midnight, symbolizing the greatest level of peril to humanity since its creation in 1947 as the threat posed by climate change and a growing nuclear race loomed large. The danger level was compounded by information warfare and disruptive technologies ranging from deepfake video and audio to the militarization of space and the development of hypersonic weapons. ""We are now expressing how close the world is to catastrophe in seconds – not hours, or even minutes,"" said Rachel Bronson, president of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, in announcing the change. The decision on the clock is taken by panels of experts, including 13 Nobel laureates. It was originally set at 7 minutes to midnight, and the previous worst – two minutes to midnight – held from 2018 to 2019 as well as 1953. The furthest it has ever been is 17 minutes, following the end of the Cold War in 1991. Scrapped treaty On the nuclear front, the arms control boundaries that helped prevent catastrophe over the last half century are being dismantled and may be gone by next year, said subject expert Sharon Squassoni. This includes the demise in 2019 of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, with the US and Russia entering a new competition to deploy once-banned weapons. The US has suggested it won't extend New START, an arms reduction treaty signed in 2010. ""This year could see not just the complete collapse of the Iran nuclear deal,"" added Squassoni, with Tehran boosting its enrichment efforts. And despite initial hopes US President Donald Trump's unorthodox approach to North Korea may produce results, no real progress ensued, said Squassoni, with Pyongyang instead vowing to press ahead with a new strategic weapon. Climate hope? On climate, two major UN summits fell dismally short of the action required to limit long-term warming to the goals laid out by the Paris Agreement that scientists say is necessary to prevent catastrophe. The effects were already apparent in the record-breaking heat waves and floods India faced in 2019, and the wildfires that raged from the Arctic to Australia. ""If humankind pushes the climate into the opposite of an ice age,"" said Sivan Kartha, a scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute, ""we have no reason to be confident that such a world will remain hospitable to human civilization."" Yet the experts took heart in mounting climate activism spearheaded by a youth movement that is spurring some governments to action. Misinformation campaigns and fake news catalyzed by deepfake videos are potent threats to social cohesion, while the rise of AI weapons like drones that attack targets without human supervision create new uncertainty. Russia meanwhile has announced a new hypersonic glide missile and the US is testing its own weapons that severely limit response times of targeted nations. Space, long an arena for international cooperation, is also becoming increasingly militarized with multiple countries testing projectile and laser anti-satellite weapons and the US creating a new military branch, the Space Force.

Its release has been delayed repeatedly. The economic part of the plan was shared in June and calls for $50 billion in international investment in the Palestinian territories and neighboring Arab countries over 10 years. The Palestinians, who refuse to talk to the Trump administration since he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, reject the peace plan because it seems to bury the two-state solution that for decades has been the cornerstone of international diplomacy aimed at the two. On the plane Trump said he was pleased that both Netanyahu and his main electoral rival Benny Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White party, would come to the White House in the middle of the campaign for Israeli elections on March 2. ""We have both candidates coming — unheard of,"" Trump said. Asked if he had contacted the Palestinians, Trump said: ""We've spoken to them briefly. But we will speak to them in a period of time."" ""And they have a lot of incentive to do it. I'm sure they maybe will react negatively at first but it's actually very positive for them,"" Trump said. But the Palestinian Authority reiterated its rejection of the White House peace plan. ""This step only reaffirms our absolute rejection of what the US administration has done so far, particularly the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital,"" Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas' spokesman said in a statement. Trump, whose team has long been working on the outlines of a secretive peace plan, has repeatedly boasted that he is the most pro-Israeli US president in history. Abbas cut off all ties with the United States in December 2017 after Trump broke with decades of international consensus and recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Palestinians see the eastern part of the city as the capital of their future state and world powers have long agreed that Jerusalem's fate should be settled via negotiations. Trump's 'ultimate deal' Trump came to power in 2017 promising to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace, which he labelled the ""ultimate deal."" But he has since taken a series of decisions that outraged the Palestinians, including cutting hundreds of millions in aid and declaring that the United States no longer considered Israel's West Bank settlements illegal. His plan for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is believed to revolve around encouraging massive economic investment. After many postponements, the peace initiative was expected several months ago. But it was delayed after September elections in Israel proved inconclusive, and it was not expected to be released until after the March 2 elections. Israeli media discussed what it said were leaked outlines of the deal Thursday, saying the United States had acquiesced to many key Israeli demands. The Washington meeting will come little more than a month before new Israeli elections, with polls showing Netanyahu's right-wing Likud and Gantz's centrist Blue and White party neck-and-neck. The meeting on Tuesday coincides with an expected session in the Israeli parliament to discuss Netanyahu's potential immunity from prosecution over a series of corruption charges. Israeli media speculated that Trump had chosen to announce the event in support of Netanyahu's election bid – the third in a year. Husam Zomlot, former head of the Palestinian mission in the United States, told AFP that Trump hosting two Israeli leaders and no Palestinians showed the meeting was about influencing domestic Israeli politics, rather than a genuine attempt at peace.

The Spanish world No. 1 was in the throes of wrapping up his second-round clash on Thursday, January 23 at Rod Laver Arena against Argentine Federico Delbonis when the unfortunate girl found herself in his firing line. Nadal went over to check how she was and gave her a quick peck on the cheek for good measure, leaving the youngster blushing. ""For her it was not a good moment, I was so scared for her, the ball was quick and straight on her,"" Nadal said after the match, giving her his headband as a momento. ""She's a super brave girl.

The victory set up a third-round clash with countryman Pablo Carreno Busta, his doubles partner at this month's ATP Cup. ""It was a tough match. I lost a lot of opportunities on break point but found a way to finally win the 2nd set,"" he said. ""In the 3rd I was more relaxed, more aggressive and found better play in that set."" Nadal had dropped only 10 games in 3 previous emphatic wins over 76th-ranked Delbonis and defeat was never on the cards at Melbourne Park. But the Argentine, whose best Grand Slam result was the third round in Melbourne in 2016, made life hard for Nadal, fending off 17 of his break point chances. ""I think I can do lot of things better. But is not because of Delbonis. I can do things better because of myself. I need to play better,"" said Nadal. ""Especially I need to convert the break points. But that's just something that happened today. We don't need to put a lot of attention on this. ""Just was something that is hopefully history of just one day."" Nadal looked on track for another straightforward victory after racing through the opening set, sealing it with a trademark crosscourt forehand. But he found it tougher going in the 2nd, which went with serve up to the tiebreaker. Nadal, though, came through and Delbonis never recovered as the Spaniard asserted his authority to race home, but not before hitting a ballgirl on the head with a fearsome shot. – Rappler.com  "

In announcing the move, which takes effect Friday, January 24, the White House said foreigners were using the visas ""to secure automatic and permanent American citizenship for their children by giving birth on American soil."" (READ: U.S. says will deny citizenship to immigrants who use public benefits) ""The integrity of American citizenship must be protected,"" White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement. Temporary B-1 and B-2 visitor visas would no longer be issued to ""aliens seeking to enter the United States for 'birth tourism,'"" the White House said. Calling the practice ""a glaring immigration loophole,"" it argued that the crackdown on ""birth tourism"" was for public safety and national security as well as to maintain the ""integrity of our immigration system."" ""The birth tourism industry threatens to overburden valuable hospital resources and is rife with criminal activity, as reflected in federal prosecutions,"" it said. ""Closing this glaring immigration loophole will combat these endemic abuses and ultimately protect the United States from the national security risks created by this practice,"" the White House said. ""It will also defend American taxpayers from having their hard-earned dollars siphoned away to finance the direct and downstream costs associated with birth tourism,"" it said. The US Constitution guarantees automatic American citizenship to anyone born on US soil. Trump has made restricting illegal immigration a top priority of his administration, and has threatened in the past to abolish birthright citizenship. No pregnancy test Under the new rule, a US consular officer ""shall deny a B nonimmigrant visa to an alien who he or she has reason to believe intends to travel"" to the United States for the purpose of giving birth in the country. Enforcing the new rule may prove problematic. A State Department official told reporters that ""consular officers have been directed not to ask all female applicants if they are pregnant or intend to become pregnant."" ""Officers will not be allowed to require any sort of pregnancy test,"" the official added. The official said it was estimated that thousands of children were born in the United States each year to women who arrived in the country using B visas and the number was rising. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, there were 33,000 babies born from ""birth tourism"" between mid-2016 and mid-2017.

A man goes to Taal Volcano Island, which is supposed to be off-limits as the volcano is under Alert Level 4. Screenshot from viral video MANILA, Philippines – In reaction to a viral video, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) reiterated that going to Taal Volcano Island in Batangas could be deadly while the volcano remains under Alert Level 4. The video, which was posted on YouTube as early as Tuesday, January 21, shows a man on a ""short trip to Taal Volcano"" and trying to describe the situation. He walks around and is followed by someone taking the footage. The video has since been reposted and shared on various Facebook pages. ""Nakita po namin 'yan. Of course, nag-aalala po kami na baka po mahikayat ang maraming tao na pumunta ng Taal Volcano Island, so napakamapanganib po nito. Kung mapapansin 'nyo po, 'yung atin pong kababayan ay naka-tsinelas pa.... Medyo mainit po 'yung lupa diyan,"" said Maria Antonia Bornas, chief of the Phivolcs Volcano Monitoring and Eruption Prediction Division, in a press briefing on Friday morning, January 24. (We saw that video. Of course, we're worried that many people might be encouraged to go to Taal Volcano, so that's very dangerous. If you notice, the man was wearing slippers. The ground there is hot.) Bornas said the man was along the Daang Kastila Trail, not at Taal's main crater itself. ""'Yung dinaanan niya po ay ang Daang Kastila, ito po ngayon ay binabaybay ng isang malaking fissure.... Meron pong nabuo o nahulma na explosion pit diyan, at dito po sa explosion pit, maaari po tayong magkaroon ng biglang pagputok,"" she said.

""Kasama na rin po dito ang posibilidad na magkaroon po ng biglang pagputok ng bulkan na maaari pong ikamatay at hindi matakbuhan,"" she added. (And there's also the possibility that the volcano would have a hazardous eruption which could be deadly, one that a person would not be able to run from.) Aside from these, Bornas warned that Taal is emitting sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is toxic and extremely dangerous, especially if inhaled in high concentrations. Carbon dioxide from the volcano may also cause asphyxiation or suffocation, she added. Alert Level 4 means a hazardous eruption is ""imminent"" or may occur ""within hours to days."" ([PODCAST] Taal Volcano 2020 eruption: Ano ang worst-case scenario?) Since Alert Level 4 was raised on the evening of January 12 – the day the Taal Unrest began – Phivolcs has recommended ""total evacuation"" of Taal Volcano Island as well as high-risk areas within a 14-kilometer radius from the main crater. It was ultimately up to local government units to decide on and subsequently implement evacuation orders. At least 11 towns have enforced total lockdowns. (WATCH: Anxious villagers plead against lockdown of areas near Taal Volcano) Latest observations In its 8 am bulletin on Friday, Phivolcs said it observed ""weak to moderate emission of white steam-laden plumes 50 to 500 meters high from the main crater."" SO2 emission was also measured at an average of 224 tons per day. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far) ""Nung mga nakaraang araw, napansin po natin naibsan po 'yung steam – maaari pong dahil sa nabarahan ang daanan, maaari din naman na naubusan ng sulfur dioxide 'yung ibabaw ng magma.... Ngayon po ay mas masigabo na ang steam dahil baka nawala na 'yung bara o 'yung pagtigas ng ibabaw ng magma,"" Bornas said. (In the past days, we noticed easing of steam coming from the volcano – possibly because the vents were blocked, or sulfur dioxide had already been degassed from the top part of the magma.... Now the steam is more pronounced possibly because the blockages are gone or the top part of the magma is no longer solid.) Phivolcs again advised residents to be on alert against ""the effects of heavy and prolonged ashfall,"" especially children, the elderly, and those with respiratory illnesses. Volcanic earthquakes also persist. Phivolcs is using two networks to monitor these – the Philippine Seismic Network which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former. The Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 738 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12. Of these, 176 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. From 5 am on Thursday, January 23, until 5 am on Friday, there were 7 volcanic earthquakes plotted at magnitudes 1.2 to 2.7, with no felt event. Meanwhile, the Taal Volcano Network recorded 486 volcanic earthquakes – including 4 low-frequency earthquakes – just in the past 24 hours. According to the United States Geological Survey, low-frequency earthquakes ""are caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface."" ""Mayroong kaunting pagsipa sa bilang at lakas ng mga lindol nitong nakaraang 24 oras,"" Bornas said. (There was a slight increase in the number and energy of volcanic earthquakes in the past 24 hours.)

""I can understand why PRRD [President Rodrigo Roa Duterte] is peeved by the cancellation of [Senator] Bato’s visa because of alleged extrajudicial killings in connection with the drug war.

Locsin only replied, ""I wish."" After earlier sanctions seeking to deny entry to Philippine officials involved in the detention of Senator Leila de Lima was included in the US State Department's 2020 budget, Locsin said it was the US' prerogative to deny entry to individuals as it wished, since doing so was part of ""an aspect of sovereignty."" Duterte's threats: Locsin and Lorenzana issued the remarks in response to Duterte's warning he would scrap the VFA if the US government did not ""correct"" the cancellation of the visa of Dela Rosa, his first Philippine National Police chief and is known as the architect of his bloody anti-illegal drug campaign. ""I'm warning you, this is the first time: 'Pag hindi ninyo ginawa ang correction diyan, I will terminate the basis of Visiting Forces Agreement.

The VFA, which took effect in 1999, outlined guidelines for the conduct of American troops visiting the Philippines. The agreement is the foundation for military exercises between the Philippines and its oldesy military ally, the US. While the Senate ratified the VFA, senators said on Friday that it can be terminated without the concurrence of the Senate. Retaliating against sanctions: Apart from this, Duterte also threatened to deny entry to more US senators who voted for a Senate resolution that seeks sanctions against Philippine officials involved in the detention of De Lima as well as the extrajudicial killings in relation to the Duterte administration's drug war. US Senate Resolution 142, which invoked the Global Magnitsky Act, was unanimously adopted in the US Senate last January 9.

The upcoming film will be set in the present day Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's a big time jump forward from the 90s-era setting of the first film, which followed Carol Danvers, a woman who gained superhuman abilities after surviving an explosion, and is now on a mission to save the world from alien warfare. The film – the first from Marvel that is centered on a female superhero – became the 7th highest-grossing movie in the Philippines ever, and made over $11.7 million within less than a month of its opening. Marvel has yet to make any announcements on the sequel. – Rappler.com "

Police officers and security guards stand outside the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market where the coronavirus was detected in Wuhan on January 24, 2020. Photo by Hector Retamal/AFP WUHAN, China (3rd UPDATE) – Chinese authorities rapidly expanded a mammoth quarantine effort aimed at containing a deadly contagion on Friday, January 24, to 13 cities and a staggering 41 million people, as nervous residents were checked for fevers and the death toll climbed to 26. While the World Health Organization (WHO) held off on declaring a global emergency despite confirmed cases in half a dozen other countries, China expanded its lockdown to cover an area with a total population greater than Canada's. A range of Lunar New Year festivities have been cancelled, while temporary closures of Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai's Disneyland and a section of the Great Wall were announced to prevent the disease from spreading further. The previously unknown virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. (READ: Last flight from Wuhan: 'Everyone was wearing masks') The WHO said China faced a national emergency but stopped short of making a declaration that would have prompted greater global cooperation. The outbreak emerged in late December in Wuhan, an industrial and transport hub of 11 million people in China's center, spreading to several other countries including the United States. China is in the midst of its Lunar New Year holiday, a typically joyous time of family gatherings and public festivities. But on Friday Wuhan was a ghost town, its streets deserted and stores shuttered. Worried patients Hospitals visited by Agence France-Presse (AFP) journalists bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits. (READ: What is coronavirus? New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears) At a temperature-check station, a medical staffer in bodysuit, face mask and goggles took a thermometer from a middle-aged woman, pausing to examine the reading before quickly turning back to the patient. ""Have you registered? Then go and see the doctor,"" the staffer said. One 35-year-old man surnamed Li voiced the fears of many. ""I have a fever and cough, so I'm worried that I'm infected,"" he said. ""I don't know the results yet."" With hundreds of millions of people on the move across China for the holiday, the government has halted all travel out of Wuhan, shut down its public transport and told residents to stay home. Deepening the isolation, there were few flights available to the city. ""This year we have a very scary Chinese New Year. People are not going outside because of the virus,"" a taxi driver in the city, who asked not to be named, told AFP. But he said a prolonged shutdown should not pose food-shortage problems because many Chinese had stocked up for the holiday. Besides Wuhan, 12 other smaller cities nearby have battened down the hatches, with most of them going public on Friday with various measures ranging from closing public venues and restricting large gatherings to halting public transportation and asking citizens not to leave their cities. Several of the cities have populations numbering several million, led by Huanggang, which has 7.5 million. The pathogen – 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) – has caused many outlets in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities to sell out their stocks of face masks. As reports surfaced of bed shortages in Wuhan hospitals, state media said authorities were rushing to build a new facility devoted to the outbreak in a mind-blowing 10 days. The Wuhan hospital is targeted to be ready by February 3. Dozens of excavators and trucks were filmed working on the site by state television. State broadcaster CCTV also reported that 40 medical doctors from the military were being brought in to help with intensive care. In addition, 405 medical workers were being sent to Wuhan from Shanghai, said state news agency Xinhua, with the first set of 135 flying in Friday night. On Friday, staff in full body protective suits were seen checking the temperatures of people entering a subway station in Beijing. Thermal cameras scanned passengers arriving at Beijing's West Railway Station. 'Work as one' Chinese authorities said the number of cases leapt overnight to more than 800, with 177 in serious condition. There were another 1,072 suspected cases. Officials also said that a virus patient died in Heilongjiang province in China's far northeast, the second death outside the Wuhan epicenter. Beijing has been praised for its response in contrast to SARS, when it took months to report the disease and initially denied WHO experts any access. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, asked China's people to forego New Year gatherings this year and confine themselves at home until the all-clear. ""If we all work as one, we can contain the virus in Wuhan and add no more cases exported from Wuhan, so as to stem the virus nationwide,"" Gao told state TV. Beijing has cancelled popular New Year public events at temples in the capital, the historic Forbidden City will close from Saturday, January 25, and Shanghai Disneyland said it also will shut down for an indefinite period from Saturday to protect visitors and staff. A number of tourist spots were closed and events cancelled in central Hunan province, which borders Hubei province. The crisis was given a prominent spot on the celebrated gala show on state TV Friday evening, the traditional Lunar New Year's Eve extravaganza broadcast by CCTV watched by hundreds of millions of Chinese.

The actress leaves the courtroom in Manhattan Criminal Court, on January 23 in New York City. Photo by Johannes Eisele / AFP NEW YORK, USA – The Sopranos actress Annabella Sciorra fought back tears as she told a court Thursday, January 23 that being raped by Harvey Weinstein left her feeling like she was having ""a seizure"" and caused her to self-harm. In emotional testimony at Weinstein's trial, Sciorra described him barging into her New York apartment late at night in the early 1990s and attacking her while she was wearing a nightgown. ""It was just so disgusting that my body started to shake in a way that was very unusual. I didn't really even know what was happening,"" the 59-year-old said. Sciorra faced the jury as she held her hands above her head and clasped her wrists to demonstrate how Weinstein, then 3 times her weight, held her down on her bed and sexually assaulted her. ""He got on top of me and he raped me,"" she said, under questioning by lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon. ""He put his penis inside of my vagina and he raped me,"" repeated Sciorra, the first of Weinstein's accusers to testify in proceedings symbolic to the #MeToo movement. Weinstein, 67, avoided eye contact as Sciorra told the New York state court that the former film producer then performed oral sex on her. ""I didn't have very much fight left inside me at this point. My body just shut down,"" said Sciorra. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping actress Jessica Mann. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex. Sciorra, best known for her role as Gloria Trillo in American mob drama The Sopranos, gave evidence to support the prosecution's case that Weinstein was a career sexual predator. Her allegation is too old to be included on the charge sheet, but the charge of predatory sexual assault, which carries possible life imprisonment, requires prosecutors to prove he sexually assaulted at least two people. Self-harm Sciorra said the alleged attack occurred in the plush Manhattan neighborhood of Gramercy Park in the winter of 1993 to '94 after Weinstein dropped her off at home following a business dinner at a restaurant. It left her traumatized and withdrawn and she started drinking heavily and began cutting herself afterwards, Sciorra testified. ""I would have blood on my fingers and my hands,"" she recounted. Sciorra said she did not go public with the allegations until The New Yorker magazine published her account in October 2017 because she was ""afraid for her life."" She told Weinstein's trial she never contacted police because she was confused that the alleged incident had been perpetrated by someone she knew. ""I would say I felt at the time that rape was something that happened in a back alleyway in a dark place by somebody you didn't know,"" she said. Sciorra added that when she later confronted Weinstein about the incident he became angry and threatening. She tried to avoid him out of fear but he would track her down, including to a hotel room at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival, she testified. ""When I opened the door, the defendant was in his underwear with a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a videotape in the other,"" Sciorra said. During cross-examination, lead defense attorney Donna Rotunno challenged Sciorra on the ""vague"" timeline of the alleged attack. She also questioned Sciorra as to why she did not tell friends or her building's doorman about it afterwards. ""At the time, I didn't understand that that was rape,"" said Sciorra. Rotunno also accused Sciorra of providing inconsistent information about the exact location of the apartment. The attorney played a clip from a 1997 interview in which Sciorra told host David Letterman she admitted to sometimes lying to journalists to protect her private life. ""You're a professional actress, correct?"" Rotunno asked. ""As part of that job Ms. Sciorra, you pretend to be someone you're not. Is that fair to say?"" Sciorra replied: ""No."" Over 80 women, including Angelina Jolie, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct but the trial, scheduled to run into March, relates to just two. On Friday, January 24, prosecutors are expected to call forensic psychiatrist Barbara Ziv, who testified in comedian Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial. – Rappler.com "

Section 21, Article VII of the Constitution says: “No treaty or international agreement shall be valid and effective unless concurred in by at least two-thirds of all the Members of the Senate.” The provision, however, discusses only the entry into a treaty, but is silent on withdrawal.

378,250091,"January 24, 2020",iSpeak,[OPINION] A disaster in a disaster: When too many orgs help out in emergencies,Rachelle Anne L. Miranda,"Chaos is not only limited to the impacts of disasters. More often than not, the large number of organizations with different goals and protocols can result in operational problems.    In complex emergencies and disaster response, sometimes good intentions are not enough. These situations require integrated response from various actors: government agencies, non-government organizations, civil society organizations, people’s organizations, and humanitarian organizations from the local and international community. Imagine a situation where there is a lack of integration among these groups. That’s a disaster in a disaster. Chaos is not only limited to the impacts of disasters. More often than not, the large number of organizations with different mandates, vertical structures, policies, protocols, communication means, and feedback mechanisms can result in unprecedented operational problems. (READ: EXPLAINER: Who's supposed to be in charge during disasters?) Filipino culture The outpour of assistance in disaster situations is part of the Filipino culture of altruism – or pagmamalasakit and damayan. However, this outpour can only be significant if the assistance meets the real needs of the communities. With the use of different platforms of information sharing such as broadcast and social media, it is easier to disseminate updates on disaster events. But with the redundancy of information, this leads media to only focus attention on the most visible effects of disasters. They paint a picture of the situation on-scene, and while it is true, it is not true to all. Likewise, this information oftentimes misconstrues that authorities are always in need of assistance. (READ: [OPINION] Planning and preparation: Unglamorous, yet most critical, in disasters) Several cases in past disasters suggest that organizations are really active and responsive in helping the most affected communities. However, in most of the cases, these organizations' assistance resulted in the duplication of efforts; surplus of resources; cost inefficiency; the job not fitting the technical skill or expertise; and unsafe operations where ""freelancers"" and volunteers are exposed to more harm. Thus, the real challenge in working with a large number of organizations for disaster response is ensuring that there is an on-scene management system that guarantees an integrated approach, where government and non-government agencies work together interdependently. There should be no competition between the government and non-government groups – only collaboration, coordination, and cooperation. So how can organizations and volunteers maximize their good intentions? The first essential and crucial step among organizations is to understand the elements of response in the Philippines. They need to understand that local chief executives are the officials responsible for setting priorities and providing guidance; that the emergency operations center (EOC) and response cluster are key for coordination on the operational level; and that the incident management team are for the command and control of incidents at the tactical level. Organizations also need to recognize that at the onset of disasters, the primary responsibility emanates from the local level, and that the escalation of the augmentation of support relies on the coordination mechanisms of RA10121 or the Philippine DRRM Act of 2010. Most organizations want to immediately be on-ground to help, but this is not always necessary. For the effective and systematic management of incidents, they need to coordinate first with the EOC before going on-scene. Coordination with the right authorities gives you access to the most recent reports and the overall picture of what happened and what needs to be done. It is then your role to determine whether these identified needs are aligned with your mandate and that you can be mobilized for additional support. The common misconception when adhering to protocols and systems of government is that organizations will lose their identity or mandate. But this is not the case. The government acknowledges that it has no monopoly over disaster response in general, though organizations still need to recognize the authority and leadership of the government when managing incidents. After all, the overall responsibility is still on the “owner of the incident,” who is usually holding public office. Your public office is your public trust. (READ: Itogon Tragedy: Disaster response gone wrong) Next, check in with the incident management team (IMT). The IMT ensures the safety of volunteers and organizations throughout the operations. It also recommends the assignment of resources based on the organizations' capability. The challenge when organizations “freelance"" is that they only see what they want to see and help only when it is convenient. The IMT, however, looks at the entire picture. They know what resources are required, needed, and are already on-hand. The IMT also knows which locations need more assistance or is appropriate to your assistance. Again, your organization will not lose its identity. The IMT will only lead you to where your capability fits the need. Once you are provided with a tactical assignment, implement the plan through the operations and provide feedback to the IMT for documentation purposes. Lastly and most importantly, don’t become a disaster tourist. You are there to help, so don’t expect disaster situations to be pretty. Expect the worst and plan your own safety measures as well. You also cannot take photos of evacuees, especially of children without parental permission, and post them on social media. Be aware of the data privacy law. The spirit of bayanihan in the Philippines has always been stronger than any disaster, so let’s maximize it and make our good intentions count. – Rappler.com Rachelle Anne L.

Los Angeles Lakers superstar James will captain the Western Conference team for the second consecutive season and Milwaukee Bucks reigning league MVP Antetokounmpo will once again take charge of the Eastern Conference side. James and Antetokounmpo have the honor of choosing the sides for their respective conferences because they are the top two vote getters. The two captains select the rosters for their own teams on February 6 from the pool of available players – regardless of conference – for the February 16 showcase in Chicago. The polls closed with fan ballots counting for 50%, current NBA players having 25% say and a media panel having the other 25% say in selecting the 10 starters – 2 guards and 3 forwards from each conference. Doncic is the fresh face in the starters list this season as the Slovenian standout joins Houston Rockets star James Harden in the West backcourt. Los Angeles Clippers forward and 2019 finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Lakers forward Anthony Davis fill out the frontcourt. ""I remember all the years I would wake up in Europe at 3 am to watch the game and now I can be in it,"" said Doncic. ""I just have to keep working and getting better.""

Antetokounmpo will be flanked by Philadelphia 76ers Joel Embiid and Toronto Raptors Pascal Siakam, another first time All-Star and starter, in the East frontcourt. James, who has helped the Lakers to an NBA best record of 35-9 this season, held off a charge from Doncic as the top vote-getter by fans in the West. James, with 6.27 million fan votes, and Greek superstar Antetokounmpo, with 5.90 million fan votes, led their respective conferences. Doncic had 6.11 million fan votes. It marks the third straight year that James, averaging 25.1 points, 7.6 rebounds and an NBA-best 10.8 assists per game this season, has led all players in All-Star votes. The only players who have received more All-Star selections than James are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (19) and Kobe Bryant (18). With his 16th start, James will top the mark he currently shares with Bryant. Doncic and Young, who were traded for each other on draft day, will forever be linked together. They finished 1-2 in rookie-of-the year voting last season and this season they are the only two players in the NBA to rank in the top 5 in both points and assists. Smooth transition Doncic has made a smooth transition from playing in Europe to North America. ""In Europe everything is less. Less minutes, less scoring, less free throws. But my game is kind of the same,"" he said on Thursday. ""I just try to play to my own rhythm and let the game come to me."" Raptors Siakam, who won the Most Improved Player award last season, has been on a meteoric rise. He teamed with Leonard to help Toronto win the 2019 NBA title.

New Life Community Care Foundation began as a soup kitchen for poor children in Tondo, Manila, run by the New Life Christian Center, a church based in Alabang, Muntinlupa.

Here is a story from SM Supermalls.]  MANILA, Philippines – The SM group, led by SM Supermalls chief operating officer Steven Tan, joined the relief operations for Taal eruption victims at the Calaca Central School evacuation center in Batangas last January 22. Together with its partners and affiliates, and broadcast journalist Karen Davila, SM aided over 350 displaced families in Calaca. Calaca is just one of the several smaller towns unreached by the relief efforts that currently houses evacuees from Lemery. Recently, Tan appeared on a news program and talked about disaster relief and recovery efforts of the SM Group in Batangas after the eruption through its Oplan Tulong Express program – a program in partnership with the SM Foundation, SM Cares, and the Philippine National Red Cross. Tan also encouraged members of the private sector to extend assistance to affected areas and to their respective employees who are gravely affected by the calamity. He called the support of everyone to drop off in-kind donations at the designated Oplan Tulong Express booths in 12 SM malls in South Luzon (namely Bacoor, Dasmariñas, Molino, Rosario, Trece Martires, Imus, Santa Rosa, San Pablo, Calamba, Batangas, Lipa, and Lucena).    SM Center Lemery in Batangas has been closed since January 13, but its employees were absorbed by nearby SM malls in Batangas City and Lipa City. As part of its business continuity programs, SM’s disaster recovery center in Clark has copies of important business documents for tenants, especially MSMEs, to retrieve and use for insurance claims and other operational requirements. The SM group, along with its affiliates and partners, has given over 23,000 relief packs to evacuation centers in over 50 towns and barangays in Batangas and now reaching centers in Cavite and Laguna.

384,250097,"January 24, 2020",Philippines,Lacson questions ending VFA to get Dela Rosa's visa back,Aika Rey,"(UPDATED) Senator Panfilo Lacson says the Supreme Court needs to 'act soonest' on whether a two-third vote by the Senate is needed to terminate international treaties  PH-US WAR GAMES. This file photo shows US soldiers and their Filipino counterparts joining forces in an Amphibious Landing operation as part of the 2015 Balikatan Exercises. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Senator Panfilo Lacson questioned President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to end the Philippines' Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) following the cancellation of the US visa of Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa. ""Where is the connection?"" Lacson asked on Friday, January 24, saying that bargaining VFA with Dela Rosa's visa are two different things. ""The Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and United States is a BILATERAL accord that went through some back-and-forth diplomatic discussions prior to ratification by the Senate, after some intense plenary deliberation,"" Lacson said. ""On the other hand, the US visa is a conditional authorization UNILATERALLY given to a visiting foreigner which may be granted, canceled or even denied outright, without need for explanation or justification,"" he added. Lacson, whose US visa was also canceled, said he didn't make an issue out of it. His visa was revoked after the 2000 case where he got classified information from then-White House security specialist Leandro Aragoncillo. ""I never make an issue out of it for the same reason that I am saying now – it is the US government’s right, as it was only my privilege to be granted the same,"" he said. In another tweet, Lacson also cited the significant help that the Philippines had been receiving from the US under the VFA. ""International terrorist Zulkifli Abdhir Marwan was neutralized with the technical assistance extended by the US. The VFA has provided our AFP the military training and equipment, thus upgrading their capability. That and more may be missed,"" he said. Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Sabaya was also neutralized in June 2002, also with the help of US tecnical assistance. Dela Rosa, meanwhile, said that the President's bargain is ""not all about him."" ""He is a leader who doesn’t want his people treated unfairly. I don't deserve this bargain, but it's not all about me. It is about a one-sided foreign relations,"" said Dela Rosa, who has a lot to lose with the visa cancelation as he has relatives in the US. Issue on Senate concurrence Several lawmakers had raised the issue of treaties that may easily be revoked by the President as he wished, because of the lack of safeguards such as Senate concurrence. ""While Senate ratification was needed to make the VFA valid – which the Senate did during presidency [of Joseph Estrada] – it can now be terminated without concurrence of the Senate,"" Drilon said. During the 17th Congress, at least 14 senators had filed a resolution declaring that the Senate has a say in the termination of any treaty or international agreements. The resolution was filed in 2016 after Duterte had declared intentions to scrap the VFA and withdraw from the International Criminal Court. The same justification led to the actual withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC. The Supreme Court has yet to issue a decision on the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC, which may set the guidelines on terminating international agreements. ""In the absence of a Philippine Supreme Court ruling on the President’s power to unilaterally break a treaty or bilateral agreement like the VFA without the consent of a 2/3 supermajority vote of the members of the Senate, the President can do that without the Senate’s approval or consent,""  Lacson said. ""The Supreme Court should act soonest on whether the Senate’s consent is needed before the executive department can terminate a treaty or bilateral agreement – an issue raised in a petition filed before it by members of the Senate,"" Lacson added. Foreign interference? Senator Francis Pangilinan said that ending the VFA is in line of Duterte's pivot to China. ""Pabor sa China ang pagterminate ng VFA, kaya hindi na katakataka ito. (The termination of the VFA is in favor of China, so this is not surprising),"" Pangilinan said. The senator also added that the President should have focused on other things such as the welfare of the residents affected by the Taal Volcano eruption and the threat of a new coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, Senator Aquilino Pimentel III said that he understood the decision of the President even if it sounds ""personal."" ""The reason stated by the president for terminating the PH-US VFA may sound ""personal"" but I see the point of the President. He believes Sen Bato is being punished by the US for having once been the implementor of his main program of government – the all-out war against drugs,"" Pimentel said. Pimentel added that such punishment reeks of foreign interference to domestic policy. ""Since that is domestic policy (war on drugs) then punishing someone – even if indirectly – for a domestic policy shows the intent to interfere by a foreign state with PH domestic policy,"" Pimentel said. The VFA, which took effect in 1999, outlined guidelines for the conduct of American troops visiting the Philippines and is the foundation for military exercises between the Philippines and the US, some of which the Duterte adminstration has already stopped. Duterte first threatened the abrogation of the VFA in 2016, when the  Millennium Challenge Corporation, a US aid-giving body, did not renew its grant to the Philippines over human rights concerns on the Philippines' war on drugs. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Peter Parks/AFP SYDNEY, Australia – Police investigators will join a probe into the crash of a firefighting plane that killed 3 American crew helping to battle Australia's devastating bushfires, officials said Friday, January 24. The Hercules C-130 water-bombing aircraft erupted in a fireball on impact in the Snowy Mountains on Thursday as firefighters raced to tackle another outbreak of the deadly blazes. Hazardous materials specialists were working to secure the crash site before air transport safety investigators can begin sifting through the evidence with police support. Authorities said 3 men aged 42, 43 and 45 were believed to be on board at the time of the crash, which left no survivors. Their deaths brought the toll in the bushfires to 32 since September, with New South Wales hardest hit in what the state's Emergency Services Minister, David Elliott, called ""the darkest summer of the state's history"". Flags were being flown at half mast across the state on Friday in their honour. At a farewell for 32 US and Canadian firefighters who arrived in Australia before Christmas to help fight the blazes, New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons paid tribute to the three dead. ""We will be forever indebted to the enormous contribution -- indeed the ultimate sacrifice -- that's been paid as a result of these extraordinary individuals doing a remarkable job, as they have done for years now in New South Wales,"" he said. Canadian firm Coulson Aviation owned the plane and had been contracted to help fight fires in Australia. Representatives from the company were due to arrive in Australia on Saturday, while the families of the victims were also expected to travel to Australia in the coming days. Fitzsimmons said this fire season was proving to be ""truly tragic, extended, damaging (and) destructive"". Six volunteer firefighters were also seriously injured when a water truck rolled near the fire-threatened town of Batemans Bay, on the state's south coast, on Thursday night. New South Wales Deputy Premier John Barilaro told public broadcaster ABC it was suspected some could be suffering spinal injuries. ""You can see clearly it's tough conditions and our volunteers are going beyond the norm to try to protect community and lives,"" he said. Firefighters had been battling dangerous blazes Thursday, as strong winds and temperatures reaching above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) sparked new fires across Australia's southeast before conditions eased Friday. A new heatwave is forecast for next week and could fuel a new flare-up of wildfires. A State memorial service will be held for all fallen firefighters and others killed in the fires at a later date. – Rappler.com  "

Malungkot po, lahat ng aming pinaghirapan at naipundar ay wala na po,”  Barrion said. (The smoke got thicker until the sky became dark. There was lightning coming from the volcano.

He received a standing ovation from the Brooklyn crowd when he left the game for good late in the 4th quarter with the Lakers holding a big lead. There was so little defense played in the first half of the contest on Thursday, January 23 (Friday, January 24, Manila time) that for a while it appeared James might have a chance at catching Bryant for No. 3 on the all-time scoring list. James ended the game at 33,626 points, 17 shy of Bryant. His next chance at passing Bryant will be Saturday in Philadelphia.

Central American migrants - heading in a caravan to the US - pray as members of Mexican National Guard prevent them to continue their way up north in Ciudad Hidalgo, Chiapas State, Mexico, on January 23, 2020.  Photo by Alfredo Estrella/AFP CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico – Mexican troops used tear gas to detain 800 migrants who surged into Mexico on Thursday, January 23, after wading across a river on the country's southern border with Guatemala. National Guard forces in the southern state of Chiapas prevented them from continuing their journey by forming a human fence along a road, as panic erupted among some of the migrants. The Central Americans, who were trekking on foot towards the city of Ciudad Hidalgo, were intercepted by troops who used tear gas and scuffled with the migrants to halt their progress, an AFP journalist at the scene reported. The Interior Ministry later said 800 migrants of Central American origin were ""rescued"" after crossing the border at the Suchiate River. Following their detention, the migrants were taken to buses run by the National Migration Institute, the agency that will determine their official immigration status and manage deportations. Officials said that they were still looking for another 200 migrants who managed to avoid detention. Thousands of Central Americans have crossed Mexico toward the United States in caravans in recent years, fleeing chronic poverty and brutal gang violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The so-called ""2020 Caravan"" left Honduras on January 14, gathering an estimated 3,500 people as it made its way across Guatemala. The bulk of the caravan crossed into Mexico at the weekend. Mexican National Guard troops also fired tear gas on Monday to force back migrants attempting to enter the country, leading to scenes of chaos as huge crowds of people flailed across the Suchiate River. About 500 were able to enter the country illegally, though more than 400 of them were later arrested at a roadblock. The Interior Ministry said it deported 460 Hondurans via official planes and buses following Monday's clashes. 'Peacefully' ""We want to speak with President Lopez Obrador directly,"" read one long cloth banner held up as the migrants walked Thursday. Others waved flags from their countries, as well as a giant US banner. ""We are coming peacefully,"" some of the migrants shouted. Others distributed apparently unofficial forms requesting refuge in Mexico. Pressure from Trump Mexico's migration authority said the country was ready to welcome foreigners as long as they entered the country in a manner that was ""lawful, safe and orderly."" Officials have begun implementing a government plan to offer jobs and shelter to migrants to encourage them to stay in southern Mexico. However, most want to be allowed to move freely through Mexico to the US border, citing their intention to seek asylum in the United States to escape poverty and gang violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, an anti-establishment leftist who came to office vowing to protect migrants' rights, said 4,000 jobs were available to migrants from the new caravan if they remain in southern Mexico. Mexico faces pressure to keep migrants from crossing its northern border from US President Donald Trump, who last year threatened to impose steep tariffs if the country did not do more to stop a surge of undocumented Central Americans. Lopez Obrador deployed some 26,000 troops to the country's borders in response. – Rappler.com "

HELLBLADE II. The sequel to the 2018 psychological action hit is coming to the next Xbox console. Screenshot from official Xbox website  What’s on your list of can’t miss games this year? With an entire generation growing up on the PlayStation 1, we’re betting many of you have the remakes for Final Fantasy VII and Resident Evil 3 on that list. With the resurgent Keanu Reeves making noise at last year’s E3, Cyberpunk 2077 will likely figure in many a gamer’s wishlist as well. We’ve certainly jotted down those three on ours. Here’s our complete list: Final Fantasy VII Remake First, the bad news: it’s been delayed. The good news: the delay is just one month, moving the initial release date from March to April. For more than a decade, the game’s transitioned from vaporware to actual real game, with stints in development hell in between. Now we’re just about 3 months away from playing as Cloud Strife and the gang again. Cyberpunk 2077 Here’s one that’s suffered a longer delay. Instead of April, we’ll be seeing the gritty, neon-lit, Black Mirror-esque future reality of Cyberpunk 2077 in September. As the next big game from CD Projekt Red, we’re excited to see the guys flesh out a sci-fi universe with the same kind of love it did with the medieval trappings of The Witcher series. Doom Eternal  Photo from official Doom website Doom, the granddaddy of first-person shooters, rebooted in 2016, resulting in one of the most hellacious shooting experiences of that year. Now, the franchise seeks to up the adrenaline even more with Doom Eternal, the first game to be developed on id Software’s new id Tech 7 engine. We’re a sucker for new graphical tricks, so we’re excited for this one for the new engine alone. Resident Evil 3 remake Looks like April is shaping up to be the month of the PlayStation remake. More than a year after the Resident Evil 2 remake, Capcom naturally follows it up with the next game in the series, Resident Evil 3, known for its big, bad boss, Nemesis, and also for heroine Jill Valentine’s iconic blue tube top get-up. The Last Of Us: Part II Back when the PlayStation 4 was a wee lad, it was 2014’s The Last Of Us: Remastered that helped the console become a must-own. The post-apocalyptic tale of Joel and Ellie in a world ravaged by a kind of fungus that turns people into zombies was a milestone in videogame storytelling. Now, just as the PlayStation 4 rides off into the sunset, it’s the sequel that will be accompanying it. Marvel’s Avengers Spider-Man for the PS4 in 2018 was a hit title. Now, you get to play as Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor and several other Avengers. It’s from a different developer but given the standards set by Spider-Man, we’re pretty hopeful that this game is going to do its best to live up to that. Half-Life: Alyx Photo from official Hal-Life website No, it’s not Half-Life 3. But just based on what developer Valve has shown so far, this might just be the game that will make us genuinely want a VR headset. Or not. Those headcrabs leaping on to your face in VR has at least one developer unable to deal. Baldur’s Gate 3 It appears it’s not only classic PlayStation gems that are getting a new lease on life this year. Baldur’s Gate, the hardcore PC RPG hit of the early 2000s, returns, under the stewardship of no less than Larian Studios – the studio behind the acclaimed Divinity: Original Sin II. It’d be interesting to see the studio take on the darker tone of the Baldur’s Gate series, and bring the series up to speed. Crusader Kings III This one is a little bit more niche. This grand strategy game allows you to play as royalty, of differing tiers, in medieval Europe, with the ultimate goal of becoming a king controlling a large swath of the continent. The last game in the series came out in 2012, so we’re looking forward to upgraded graphics and hopefully, tools to make the game more accessible this time around. Godfall  Photo from official Godfall website Hungry for a fresh IP? All these remakes and sequels can certainly make one clamor for a brand new title, and Godfall is looking like it could sate that hunger. The top reason: it’s one of the first games confirmed for the PlayStation 5. The high-fantasy setting of the title might just be the perfect showpiece for the new console. Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II It’s not just Sony with a new console this year. Microsoft is lining up its Xbox Series X too, which may be looking at a holiday release as well. One of the first games we have for it is Hellblade II, the sequel to the 2018 psychological action thriller featuring a female Celtic warrior in a world steeped in Norse mythology. It’s looking as disturbing as ever.  – Rappler.com    "

President Rodrigo Duterte delivers a speech after leading the distribution of benefits to former rebels at the San Isidro Central School in Leyte on January 23, 2020. Malacañang Photo MANILA, Philippines – In a fresh tirade against businessmen, President Rodrigo Duterte said “crazy rich people” should be “killed” for supposedly preventing the Filipino people from “prospering.”Duterte made the remark in a speech delivered in Visayan before beneficiaries and former rebels of the National Peoples Army in San Isidro, Leyte, on Thursday night, January 23. The Presidential Communicaitons Operations Office later provided an official translation of the speech to reporters. Pointing to the “rich” as people “who didn’t want his fellowmen to prosper,” the President said, “There are rich people in the Philippines who are crazy. They are the ones we should kill. Just wait for my signal. Behind a killing is a leader, especially if his followers are stupid and would just fire whenever they are told to.” Duterte proceeded to criticize the Ayala group and businessman Manny Pangilian once more, with whom he is currently engaged in a bitter spat with over supposedly “onerous” water concession agreements. ""Perhaps you don’t fully understand this but the Philippines has been fooled by the rich people in the Philippines. Just like Ayala, just like Pangilinan, who owns Globe and Smart. They are all thieves, those sons of bitches,"" he said. Duterte’s call to “kill” “rich” Filipinos was met with laughter and applause from the audience. Malacañang has long downplayed Duterte’s controversial remarks as “jokes” made for “dramatic effect.”The President’s tirades against the Ayala group and Pangilinan are the latest escalation after he threatened to jail them, expose individuals behind the supposedly “onerous deals,” as well as take over their operations in water distribution and file charges against themDuterte took exception to Ayala-led Manila Water and Pangilinan-led Maynilad, saying their “greed” was insatiable. “There are many rich people who are good, those who have a conscience. But these guys, they own it all. All the businesses in the Philippines. The greed in you is insatiable. Nothing,” he said.

394,250107,"January 24, 2020",Rappler IQ,"What we learned from SARS, according to ex-DOH chief Manuel Dayrit",Janella Paris,"Rappler speaks to former health secretary Manuel Dayrit, who was known as the SARS czar when the disease hit China, Hong Kong, and other parts of the world in 2003  SURVEILLANCE. The Bureau of Quarantine monitors the thermal scanner of passengers arriving from international flights at Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Pasay City on January 23, 2020 amid the reports of new strain of Coronavirus from China and spreading to other countries. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Reports of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that has caused pneumonia-like illness in China and parts of Asia and North America have revived fears of an outbreak akin to the SARS (severe acute respiratory disease) scare of 2003. So far, 25 have died, most of them found to have pre-existing illnesses. A total of 881 cases have been recorded, over 400 of them in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the disease’s epicenter. Wuhan is currently a city on lockdown, with flights to and from the city having been cancelled since Thursday, January 23. In the city, a university town of 11 million, students have been advised not to leave their rooms. Metro services have also been halted indefinitely and passenger boats and buses are being turned away as authorities scramble to contain the disease. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) Much is still unknown about the new coronavirus. Health officials in China suspect that the virus may have come from a seafood market known for selling wild animals. Human-to-human transmission is also possible, though not yet definitively confirmed. The World Health Organization (WHO) convened a council meeting on Thursday, Janaury 23, and decided not to declare the Wuhan outbreak a public health emergency of international concern for now. “This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency,” the WHO director-general said. This situation does not come without precedent. In 2003, over 800 were died in China and Hong Kong after SARS spread from the two countries to neighboring places like Vietnam to as far as Canada and the United States. The crisis then lasted for 5 months, from March 2003, when the WHO issued a global alert, to July 2003, when finally the last case was reported and contained in Taiwan. In the Philippines, SARS claimed two deaths that year – a Filipino nursing assistant visiting from Canada and her father, whom she had infected. A total of 14 cases were recorded in the country, making it the lowest count among 30 countries affected by the disease. How did the Philippines handle it then? What might we learn from the SARS crisis in case a similar one hits this time around? Rappler speaks to former health secretary Manuel Dayrit, who headed the health department during the SARS crisis of 2003. Former Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit. Photo by Janella Paris/Rappler Former Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit. Photo by Janella Paris/Rappler There are protocols in place. In case the 2019-nCoV outbreak spreads outside of China and reached the Philippines, the DOH has protocols in place dating back to the SARS crisis in 2003. The SARS crisis was unprecedentd, Dayrit said, but they weren't completely in the dark as there were guidelines set after the 1960s cholera outbreak, for example. The DOH now is saying that in the event that a case of 2019-nCoV is confirmed in the Philippines, it will ""activate the infrastructure the government already has."" This infrasturcture was one that Dayrit helped build. ""The first step is you try to prevent entry or identify those who enter and may be infected,"" he said. ""Now that's a huge challenge, because there are thousands of people who are traveling every day."" It's important, Dayrit said, to know the criteria, which DOH, through its Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) is now using when screening passengers traveling from China: If a person meets these criteria, health officials then have to do the necessary laboratory exams, which start with throat swabs and blood samples. If they turn up positive, the patient is isolated and given clinical care. ""First you do surveillance, then you do case detection, and then you do clinical care of the patient,"" Dayrit said. ""That's the protocol on the individual level."" ""If you think about it from the point of view of a country, you have to be able to be prepared to have those protocols ready everywhere as much as possible, and therefore you're looking at the places where likely infections are gonna come in,"" he added. This means monitoring ports of airports and seaports of entry, especially major travel hubs with international airports like Manila, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, and Bohol. ""You have to make sure that in those places you have the capacity to detect, the capacity to isolate, and the capacity to treat,"" Dayrit said. ""We're far, far more prepared now than we were in 2003 for this type of problem,"" Dayrit thinks. ""This is because the infrastructure has been built up. So when DOH says we're activating the protocols, it means, everything that's already been built up from the time that we encountered this problem with SARS, we're doing now."" Local government matters. Dayrit recalls how during the SARS crisis, people were so scared that a mayor once refused to let an ambulance carrying a SARS patient pass through their area of jurisdiction to be able to reach the hospital it needed to go to. This, according to Dayrit, highlights the importance of cascading information about the disease and the virus down to the local level. ""You have to function as a team, otherwise, things start getting bogged down,"" Dayrit said. This means coordiation with local executives, health workers at the local level, and the man on the street. During the SARS crisis, networks of epidemiological surveillance units were established in regions, provinces, cities, and municipalities. Health and local government personnel down to the barangay level were also briefed on information about the virus and the disease. Special hospitals, including the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, San Lazaro Hospital, the Lung Center of the Philippines, and DOH regional hospitals were designated as SARS hospitals. The DOH confirmed to Rappler that regional health offices are making sure that local governments are briefed enough about the disease in case it becomes an emergency. As for the man on the street, Dayrit said one should ask, ""What's the likelihood that I'm going to be infected by somebody who's come from China and has the disease?"" ""If there's critical awareness of your risk and if you know that it might be very low, then you can go about business as usual,"" he said. But this is no reason to be complacent, he said. ""The threat is there. If it's a novel virus, then there are going to be people who are going to encounter it that will not have defenses, that's why people have died. But if you look at it, eventually, we'll overcome it over time. I think the challenge is to overcome it with minimal casualties."" There will be a 'virus' of fear and panic. The public didn't know how to react to the SARS emergency then, Dayrit said. People refused to travel, people started panic-buying, flights were virtually empty. There was also a ""virus of fear and panic,"" as Dayrit would call it. ""Fear and panic often traveled much faster than the virus itself then,"" he said. ""When you think about these things, particularly if you are managing the situation, you have to take care to react appropriately– not to underreact, have a cavalier attitude, and be complacent, but not to overreact either,"" said the former health secretary."" Dayrit looks back on the health department's communication strategy then as a success, having conveyed the news in a ""consistent and accurate"" way. ""I'd like to think that our approach had a calming influence on the public,"" he said. Besides, then, the major sources of information were TV, radio, and newspapers. ""I think the difference now is there's a lot more fragmentation of the news and there's social media,"" Dayrit said. There have been false reports concerning the current 2019-nCoV crisis circulating online, including a Facebook post claiming that SARS was spreading in a mall in Mandaluyong, and a chain message saying there were confirmed cases of the virus in PBCom Tower in Makati. The DOH have since said that both reports were false. Dayrit also said this new landscape of news – with traditional sources and social media – ""creates a whole different cycle or ecology of how news is handled and sought."" He thinks because information can be accessed so swiftly nowadays, people just want a constant stream of information on their screens. ""There is a danger to do very irrational things because it’s driven by fear that's in turn driven by a constant stream of information,"" he cautioned. The government can counter this by disseminating public information and health advisories that may control fear and panic, like advisories that show precautionary measures in the event of viral infection, as the DOH did during Dayrit's time. Right now, as it investigates the case of a 5-year-old in Cebu and monitors other people that exhibit respiratory infection, the DOH is reminding the public to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette to curb the spread of viral diseases. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III has also said that there were still “many blindspots” concerning the new virus, allaying fears that 2019-nCoV is certainly as threatening as the virus that caused SARS years ago. There is still much about the virus that scientists have yet to determine, and technology to detect the virus in people is so far limited. But the DOH expects to build its capacities soon, after it acquires samples of the virus from China to be able to conduct laboratory exams here. It's a question of preparedness, Dayrit said. ""Even if you've set your defenses up, there's always a possibility that you'll be overrun, just by the sheer number of cases."" It doesn't hurt to expect the worst. As DOH now said, ""We need to think it [the virus] is coming so we can be prepared."" – Rappler.com "

Many of us can’t just talk about the possibility of having illnesses or the inevitability of death.

But today, Filipinos are now talking more openly and comfortably about the need to secure their future. We see this by how the number of Sun Life clients has grown from 1.5 million in 2015 to 5 million in 2019, one year ahead of their 125th anniversary. “Our efforts to serve more Filipinos have likewise led to another milestone that sustains our leadership position in the market.

Caroline Wozniacki retires at 29 as she hopes to start a family. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Caroline Wozniacki was left in tears after her glittering tennis career ended in a third-round defeat at the Australian Open on Friday, January 24. The former world No. 1, who announced in December that the Australian Open would be her final tournament, lost 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 to lower-ranked Ons Jabeur of Tunisia. Wozniacki, 29, brings the curtain down on a career that saw her win 30 WTA titles, with her sole Grand Slam triumph coming in 2018 at Melbourne Park. The Dane was in tears when the end came at the hands of 78th-ranked Jabeur and just under two hours later, her eyes were still red and puffy as she arrived at her post-match press conference. ""I was told there are tissues here. I see the tissues in case I need them, I think I'm cried out,"" said Wozniacki, who was given a round of applause by reporters. She was also given a generous reception by Melbourne Arena crowd after hitting her last shot in tennis – ""I finished my career with a forehand error. Those are the things I've been working on my whole career,"" she joked to the crowd. Choking back tears, Wozniacki, now ranked 36, added: ""Guess this is just how it was meant to be."" Wozniacki, who made her professional debut in 2005, was carried triumphantly across court by her Polish-born father – who is also her coach – Piotr. She also hugged husband David Lee, the former NBA star, as Neil Diamond's hit song ""Sweet Caroline"" reverberated around court. 'I made it happen' Wozniacki finished 2010 and 2011 as world No. 1, and ascended to the top ranking again in 2018, the year she won the Australian Open. But later that year she revealed that she was suffering with rheumatoid arthritis, which causes fatigue and joint pain. She insists that has nothing to do with her decision to leave tennis and says she hopes to start a family. Defeat for Wozniacki, minutes before Serena Williams' shock loss to Wang Qiang, deprived the close friends of an emotional meeting in the fourth round. Williams also cried when asked about Wozniacki's retirement. ""She came into the locker room afterwards, we were both kind of bummed about our matches,"" said the American, 38. It was then that Williams, who was a bridesmaid at Wozniacki's wedding, began welling up too. ""She's had an amazing career. Oh my God, I'm getting emotional. Oh my,"" she said. ""God, I'm going to miss her. Guys, I can't answer Caroline questions, I'm going to be crying. She's one of my best friends in the world."" ""We have a great life for the rest of our lives together, but I'm going to miss her out on tour."" Wozniacki, who started playing tennis aged 7, said she had no second thoughts about retirement and could look back on her career with no regrets. ""The main thing I've learned is no matter where you're from, no matter what color of your skin, no matter if you're tall or short, big or small, doesn't matter,"" said the Dane. ""If you have a dream and you go for it and work hard, anything is possible."" ""I had a dream when I was a kid. I wanted to win a Grand Slam. I wanted to be No. 1 in the world.

397,250110,"January 24, 2020",Music,"Grammys set to honor music's best, but scandal overshadows gala",Agence France-Presse,"Days before the awards gala, Deborah Dugan – the first woman to head the Academy – files an explosive discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  DEBORAH DUGAN. In this file photo the Recording Academy president and CEO Deborah Dugan speaks at the Grammy Awards Nominations Conference in November 2019 in New York City. The ousted chief of the organization behind the Grammys filed a complaint days before the awards gala accusing the Recording Academy of putting her on leave after she raised concerns about sexual harassment, voting irregularites and other misconduct. Photo by Angela Weiss/ AFP) LOS ANGELES, USA – Los Angeles is gearing up for the Grammys, music's marquee night, with Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X leading a pack of young, talented contenders hoping to strike gold on Sunday, January 26. But revelations of infighting at the Recording Academy, which organizes the awards show, and an explosive allegation of rape has cast a dark shadow over the glitzy gala and rattled the institution's efforts to shed its out-of-touch image. On Tuesday, January 21, Deborah Dugan – the first woman to head the Academy, a move meant to usher in a new era for a body long accused of favoritism and a lack of diversity – filed an explosive discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She says she was suspended after raising concerns over sexual harassment, voting irregularities and other misconduct within the Academy, one of music's most influential organizations. In the complaint, the former CEO – who was put on leave last week days before her filing, accused of bullying behavior – also alleged that her predecessor, Neil Portnow, had raped a foreign female musician, an allegation he has rejected as ""ludicrous and untrue."" The ongoing tempest is swirling in stark contrast with the Recording Academy's efforts to reinvent itself, and thereby appease critics who long have lambasted the Grammys as too white, too male – and too generous to music world mainstays. Diverse nominee field This year's diverse slate of nominees – which celebrates a mix of established and budding stars – did appear to be a move in a new direction. Leading the pack is the effervescent 31-year-old Lizzo – beloved by fans for her sassy, body-positive persona and unflinching messages of feminist empowerment, sexual freedom and black pride. She nabbed 8 nominations, including in all the top 4 categories. The 18-year-old goth-leaning pop iconoclast Billie Eilish and the genre-bending overnight sensation Lil Nas X, 20, both have 6 chances at Grammy gold, while the enigmatic 22-year-old R&B prodigy H.E.R. has 5. The newbie frontrunners will square off against veteran powerhouses including Ariana Grande and Beyonce, as well as alt-leaning acts Lana Del Rey, Bon Iver and Vampire Weekend. The shift follows years of sharp critique from top-tier artists including Frank Ocean, Drake and Jay-Z, who have all slammed the Grammys as irrelevant, especially citing its failure to recognize black artists. Diverse wins 'more possible' For John Vilanova, a professor at Lehigh University who has extensively researched the intersection of race and gender at the Grammys, this year's field of nominees is evidence of ""an environment that feels more possible"" for different kinds of artists to have a chance. ""It's quite interesting, to see what will happen when you have artists who are really having their first chance at this,"" he told AFP. ""Their work is being appraised by the academy for the first time."" In her first public interview since unveiling her scathing allegations that the Academy is a ""boys' club"" where powerful men line their pockets and promote a misogynistic culture with impunity, Dugan told ABC's Good Morning America on Thursday, January 23: ""I actually wanted to make change from within."" In her complaint, she said that some nominated artists have sat on the voting boards for their prospective categories. But when asked if the Grammys are ""rigged,"" Dugan sidestepped. ""I was trying at each step to take a deep breath and say, 'OK, I can make a difference, I can fix this, I can work with this team.',"" she told the ABC morning news program. 'Old Town Road' all-star show Though one-time Grammy darling Taylor Swift is up for several awards including Song of the Year, many mainstay artists are not ""looming significantly"" over the ceremony as they have in years past, Vilanova said. ""They aren't leading the discourse, they're afterthoughts – and when has Taylor Swift been an afterthought?"" Often remembered as much for its performances as its winners, the Grammys will feature Lizzo, Eilish and Grande, along with a genre-blending rendition of Lil Nas X's mega-hit ""Old Town Road"" that will feature K-pop sensation BTS, country star Billy Ray Cyrus and the eclectic DJ Diplo, among others. Artists including John Legend, Meek Mill and DJ Khaled – all up for Grammys this year – will perform a tribute to the late rapper Nipsey Hussle, who was shot dead last year and is up for 3 posthumous awards. Though the Recording Academy drama has threatened to cloud the gala, Vilanova said that in terms of expanding possibilities for artists, the Grammys appear to be taking baby steps toward structural change. ""I hesitate to call it a sea change – progress in these areas rarely happens in a straight line,"" he said. ""It's not that one artist should win – what we want to ask is, 'Do the Grammys actually represent what the music industry sounds like and looks like?'"" – Rappler.com "

""Charles Michel and I have just signed the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU, opening the way for its ratification by the European Parliament,"" Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen tweeted. In a separate tweet, Michel said: ""Things will inevitably change but our friendship will remain. We start a new chapter as partners and allies.""

British voters backed leaving the European Union in a June 2016 referendum, and after lengthy negotiations and several delays Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new government plans to ""get Brexit done"" next week. Queen Elizabeth II gave her formal assent to the British withdrawal legislation on Thursday and the European Union is now expected to complete the final formalities in the coming days. Briatin will the leave the institutions of the union, reducing it to 27 member member states, but the withdrawal agreement provides for an 11-month transition period until the end of the year. During this time, Britain and the rest of the bloc will continue to apply the same rules of business to avoid economic disruption while officials try to negotiate a broader trade deal. Most experts regard the idea that London and Brussels could agree a comprehensive free trade agreement in that time as ambitious, but officials have expressed optimism that some kind of agreement can be reached. Formal trade talks are not expected to begin until the end of February or even March, and in the meantime Barnier has been in intensive talks with EU member states on his negotiating mandate. After the transition, Britain wants the right to set its own rules in areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. But Brussels has warned that the more the UK diverges from EU standards, the less it will have unfettered access to Europe's huge single market. And a comprehensive free trade agreement of the type the European Union has signed with Canada could take years to negotiate – Rappler.com "

The march has rattled the separate, months-old protest movement that has gripped the capital and the Shiite-majority south since October, demanding a government overhaul, early elections and more accountability. In the early hours of Friday, thousands of men, women and children of all ages massed under grey skies in the Jadiriyah district of east Baghdad. ""Get out, get out, occupier!"" some shouted, while others chanted, ""Yes to sovereignty!"" The American military presence has been a hot-button issue in Iraq since a US drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis outside Baghdad airport on January 3. Two days later, parliament voted for all foreign troops – including some 5,200 US personnel – to leave the country. The vote was non-binding and a senior US official sad Thursday that Washington had yet to open talks with Baghdad on a troop pullout. ""There has not been any real engagement,"" said ambassador James Jeffrey, the US special envoy for Syria and the coalition against the Islamic State group. But he added that operations against the jihadists had been on hold since the drone strike, which triggered retaliatory Iranian missile strikes targeting US troops in Iraq. ""Coalition operations have been primarily on pause in Iraq as we focus on force protection and looking into the way forward with the Iraqi government,"" Jeffrey said. Long opposed to the US troop presence, Sadr seized on the public anger over the drone strike to call ""a million-strong, peaceful, unified demonstration to condemn the American presence and its violations"". Several pro-Iran factions from the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force, usually rivals of Sadr, have backed his call and pledged to join. Preparations were in full swing as early as noon on Thursday, with additional checkpoints across Baghdad to secure the protest area and buses ferrying in people for the rally. 'Politicised' protests But separate anti-government protesters, who have braved violence that has left 470 people dead since October, fear their cause could be eclipsed by Sadr's powerplay. ""Sadr doesn't represent us,"" one teenager said defiantly late Thursday on a blocked-off thoroughfare in Baghdad. To head off Friday's gathering and ramp up pressure on authorities to enact reforms, young demonstrators blocked streets in Baghdad and across the south this week. When Sadr announced the rally last week, many feared he would hold it near Tahrir (Liberation) Square – the main focus of the long-running protests. But his spokesman Saleh al-Obeidy said late Wednesday that they had chosen Jadiriyah, near Baghdad University, as the gathering place. That, in turn, has sparked worry that angry crowds could attack the presidential palace or the high-security Green Zone, home to the US embassy and other foreign missions. The move would not be without precedent for Sadr, who urged followers to storm the Green Zone in 2016 in a challenge to the government over undelivered reforms. Sadr battled US forces at the head of his Mehdi Army militia after the US-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. He later branded himself a reformist and backed the recent anti-government protests when they erupted in October. The firebrand cleric controls parliament's largest bloc and his followers hold top ministerial positions. The 46-year-old is a notoriously fickle politician, known for switching alliances quickly. ""Some sides representing the October revolutionaries think Iran is solely responsible for Iraq's ruin and others represented by the Hashed or its supporters say America is the source of ruin,"" Obeidy said Wednesday. ""We believe that both are behind this ruin, and Sadr is trying to balance between the two."" Hedging bets Harith Hasan of the Carnegie Middle East Center said Sadr was trying to sustain his ""multiple identities"" by backing various protests. ""On the one hand, (he seeks to) position himself as the leader of a reform movement, as a populist, as anti-establishment,"" Hasan told AFP. ""On the other hand, he also wants to sustain his image as the leader of the resistance to the 'American occupation',"" partly to win favour with Iran. Sadr may also have domestic motivations, Hasan said. ""This protest will show Sadr is still the one able to mobilize large groups of people in the streets -- but it's also possible he wants other groups to respond by giving him more space to choose the prime minister."" – Rappler.com "

Coco Gauff continues to impress in the Australian Open by taking down the titleholder. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Unseeded 15-year-old Coco Gauff beat reigning champion Naomi Osaka in straight sets in a major upset at the Australian Open on Friday, January 24. The American prodigy, making her Melbourne debut this year, beat the No. 3 seed Osaka, 6-3, 6-4, in the third round to avenge her heavy defeat at the US Open last year. Gauff, the youngest player in the draw, will play USA's Sofia Kenin or China's Zhang Shuai. ""Oh my gosh. Two years ago, I lost the first round in the juniors and now I'm here – this is crazy,"" said Gauff. ""I was just telling myself one point at a time and just keep fighting because you never know what happens on this court."" This was the second instalment of a budding rivalry that could light up tennis for the next decade or more, having met at the US Open, where Osaka won easily. Gauff, who spent time training with Serena Williams in the offseason, had said she would be less nervous and more aggressive this time round. And so it proved as they rattled through the first 5 games in barely 15 minutes at the 15,000-capacity Rod Laver Arena. Osaka, a relative veteran at age 22, fired into the net to drop serve in Game 8 and then racked up more unforced errors in gifting Gauff the first set in 32 minutes. ""Come on!"" shouted Gauff, ranked 67 but fast making a name for herself as the most exciting prospect in women's tennis. The young American carried the momentum into the first game of the next set, breaking a subdued and rattled the Japanese, a two-time Grand Slam champion. Osaka broke back for 1-1 when Gauff volleyed into the net, but it was a rare mistake by the American and she broke once more, before serving for the match at 5-4. The nerveless teenager clinched victory on the first match point when Osaka fired into the net. Gauff announced herself to the sporting world at Wimbledon last year when, as a qualifier, she stunned Venus Williams in the first round. She did the same thing to the seven-time Grand Slam champion on her Melbourne debut this week, then came back from a set and 3-0 down to defeat Sorana Cirstea on Wednesday. When the two met 5 months ago in New York, also in third round, then-world No. 1 Osaka crushed the tearful and overawed Gauff, 6-3, 6-0, in a little over an hour. That first clash was memorable also for what happened afterwards, when the teenager cried and Osaka consoled her, before the latter herself began welling up. – Rappler.com "

Banning Huawei entirely could also cost 'billions' of pounds and delay the rollout of 5G and full-fiber broadband.  HUAWEI. Illuminated Huawei and 5G signs are on display during the 10th Global mobile broadband forum hosted by Chinese tech giant Huawei in Zurich on October 15, 2019. File photo by Stefan Wermuth/AFP LONDON, United Kingdom – Britain is expected to announce next week whether to allow China's Huawei to develop its 5G network, an official said on Friday, January 24, setting out reasons for agreeing despite US opposition. The official said the decision had not yet been taken but it was likely to be next week. There had been speculation Britain would allow Huawei into ""non-core"" elements of the next-generation 5G mobile networks, such as antennae and base stations attached to masts and roofs. The United States has banned Huawei from the rollout of its 5G network because of concerns – strongly denied – that the firm could be under the control of Beijing. It has been lobbying Britain to do the same, even threatening to limit intelligence sharing between the two allies if the UK goes its own way. British Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said this week that a decision would be made ""soon."" adding many factors were being considered. These included ""the availability of other providers"" and ""the work that Huawei has already done in the United Kingdom"", she said. The senior official said Britain – unlike the United States – had been using Huawei technology in its systems for the past 15 years. Security agencies believe they have managed the risk so far and will be able to do so with the 5G network, the official said. Banning Huawei entirely could also cost ""billions"" of pounds and delay the rollout of 5G and full-fiber broadband, the official said. There is also a problem in that few other firms have the technology that Huawei does. Huawei provides the least expensive and most advanced alternative for super-fast data transfers behind technologies such as self-driving cars and remotely operated factory robots. ""There is a market failure here,"" the official said, adding that while this could be addressed in the future, for now ""we are where we are"".

(READ: Mighty survives El Khatib eruption for Dubai opener win) For brief moments in the 2nd quarter, the 23-year pro baller was matched up against the young Dave Ildefonso, whom El Khatib even blew past by on the fastbreak for a layup around halfway through the period. Interestingly, Dave was not the first Ildefonso El Khatib faced in his career. Exactly 20 years ago, a then springy 20-year-old El Khatib was invited to play in the 2000 PBA All-Star Game against none other than Dave's father, the legendary Danny Ildefonso. Although El Khatib teamed up with other Asian Basketball Confederation (ABC) stars like Rommel Adducul, the 2000 PBA All-Star squad coached by Tim Cone breezed past them with a 101-81 win. Johnny Abarrientos was named the game's MVP, ahead of other legends like Ildefonso, Alvin Patrimonio and Kenneth Duremdes. Fast-forward to the present, and El Khatib is still schooling the young bloods in local and international competitions, with no signs of slowing down. He even retired from the Lebanese national team on a high note, averaging a tournament-best 25.9 points per game in the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup. There, the ""Lebanese Tiger"" notably erupted for 36 points, 8 assists and 6 rebounds on a 10-of-19 shooting in a 106-87 classification round win against Gilas Pilipinas.

409,250123,"January 27, 2020",iSpeak,[OPINION] The price we pay when we neglect our farmers,Lorelei Baldonado Aquino,"Farmers like Mang Dante struggle to survive the severe effects of the rice tariffication law. It's because of stories like his that farmers need your moral and financial support.    What extreme circumstance could have possibly compelled a 58-year-old farmer to take his own life? That question has been nagging at me since I learned earlier this week that I will no longer see Mang Dante* when we go back to Nueva Ecija for our planned medical mission. The first time I met Mang Dante was when I did an interview with him, along with two other farmers, prior to the event that Team Pilipinas sponsored for them last December. The second was during the event itself, the Maagang Pamasko para sa Magsasakang Pilipino, an early Christmas party that we threw for our beloved Nueva Ecija farmers who were severely affected by the implementation of the Rice Tariffication Law early last year. During those two occasions, I remembered one thing about Mang Dante. He had the saddest eyes I had ever seen. I was not sure if it was due to the years of working like a horse tilling his land from sun-up to sun-down, and moonlighting as a construction worker – two backbreaking jobs that, sadly, both yield a meager income. Is it due to the incessant stress of having to feed, send to school, and financially support 5 children? Together with his wife who works as a dressmaker, Mang Dante hoped that, through education, the next generation of their family would be able to break the shackles of extreme poverty that crippled them and the generations before them. Is it because he could no longer work his beloved land after he had a stroke one and a half years ago, a condition which left him partially paralyzed? Nobody really knows. But Mang Dante was a dignified man, who felt he was bonded to the precious farmland that he was used to working for so long. Last December, when Mang Dante received his Noche Buena packages and other Christmas gifts (the same items that we brought for all 106 of our recipient-farmers), as well as a cash gift from a donor for his therapy, I witnessed a glimmer of happiness in his usually tired, dull eyes. I mourn the fact that I will never see Mang Dante again. Aside from regret, there is that guilt that we were not able to do more for him, and the frustration of not having enough resources to alleviate our farmers’ suffering. The feeling that’s gripping me right now is resentment. (READ: [ANALYSIS] Plummeting rice prices: How will our rice farmers cope?) The Philippines was the world's biggest rice importer in 2019 due to the lifting of quantitative restrictions on rice imports. We got that rank despite the fact that we are a predominantly agricultural country. (READ: [ANALYSIS] Duterte's ban on rice imports: Enough of these capricious policies) Meanwhile, our local farmers went bankrupt. Some could not even sell their palay unless they offered it at an extremely low price. (READ: Rice tarrification: Birth pains force farmers' kids out of school) The government was also able to get more than its estimated P10 billion in tariffs from these imports, yet when our local farmers struggled to make ends meet, they were offered loans and credit instead of sufficient grants and cash subsidies. Hoping to be heard, farmers' groups submitted some 50,000 signatures for its petition to repeal the Rice Tarrification Law to the House of Representatives. But so far, there are hardly any plans to repeal, revise, or suspend the said law. The government has been repeating promises to put an end to corruption, and stop rice cartels and other entities from manipulating rice prices. Until now, farmers continue to lose big-time to unscrupulous rice traders, smugglers, cartels, and hoarders. Finally, I resent how there are government officials who add insult to injury through their insensitive public pronouncements, such as “Baliw na baliw kayo sa research (You're going gaga over research),” and “Why eat galunggong if it’s too expensive?” There are also those whose insatiable greed drives them to buy rice and corn farms and convert them into subdivisions, without consideration of future generations that will be deprived of their staple food. If not for these kinds of power wielders, our farmers will not be as miserable as they are now. They will not be suffering as much. Mang Dante may even be alive today. Binhi ng pag-asa Mang Dante’s story became our inspiration for the next Team Pilipinas project, tentatively titled Binhi ng Pag-asa. Our aim is to provide a lifeline to farmers who need moral and financial support until an actual solution is in sight. We want them to know that there is hope, and that there are people who would like to help. Plans are still tentative, but we would like to cover as many towns as our resources would allow. We plan to coordinate with the municipal agricultural offices, and distribute seeds and fertilizers to approximately 100 farmers from each town or two per barangay. We plan to do this for each crop cycle, or 3 times a year. To this end, we would like to make an appeal to generous ninongs and ninangs, whether as individuals or as corporate sponsors, to pledge an estimated P1500 per year. Last Christmas, the municipal agricultural office of Talavera distributed free seeds, and we gave each farmer 2 bags of fertilizers at P250 per bag. Assuming this price is standard in all the areas covered, P1500 should be enough for one year’s supply of fertilizers. We also hope to gather government officials, agricultural experts and NGOs in a forum to work together to share best practices – both in planting and in marketing – and share the forum’s recommendations to all interested farmers. Finally, we would like to keep our promise to Mang Dante to return to Talavera with a medical and dental mission this March. Please email tiny_aquino@yahoo.com if you would like to volunteer your services for the medical mission this March. We will be needing doctors, nurses, dentists, dental hygienists, as well as civilian volunteers. We will also be needing various medicines and hygiene kits.

410,250124,"January 25, 2020",Tech Features,How Londoners trick facial recognition tech,"Isobel Cockerell, Coda Story","A group of Londoners defy security cameras by walking through the city in surreal face paint  FOOLING TECHNOLOGY. Image adapted from work by Sofiya Voznaya for Coda Story It’s a rainy night in Deptford, a fast-gentrifying area of south-east London. Sheltering from the drizzle in the lobby of a theatre, I find a group of young people daubing blue, black and red paint on their faces in strange, geometric shapes. “Get some paint on, and we’ll be ready leave at 7,” someone says, handing me a mirror, a brush and a sticky black cake of paint. This is London’s Dazzle Club. They meet once a month to walk through the city for an hour, wearing face paint to defy dozens of public and private security cameras. Founder Emily Roderick, 24, paints an attendee’s face with blue and black oblongs. “I’m painting his face in a way that would stop facial recognition algorithms from recognizing there’s a face there,” she tells me. “Your face is very symmetrical; it has specific areas of light and dark — and I’m trying to use the paint to reverse that.” Our third walk took place on 17th September and was led by @georginarowl . We were led around the Canary Wharf Estate beginning at The Traffic Light Tree and ending at Robin Hood Gardens. “Within this space, our group of participants walk through the site wearing anti-facial recognition face paint. Our entrance triggers a flurry of radio calls, high alert. Suspicious activity. A group of people walking around the highly controlled land wearing unconventional makeup, walking in patterns across the public space. ​no filming, no photography, no protesting, no littering, no organised gatherings. After getting stopped various times on our venture, and facing the fast oncoming traffic of the large Blackwall roundabout, the group stops at Robin Hood Gardens. One block remains. Warm orange light seeps out of the flats, sounds of residents cooking, clanking pans reverberates against the high walls surrounding the redevelopment, ‘​Blackwall Reach​’. The surroundings of the long block are a sprawling construction site. Cranes reach into the sky emblazoned with advertising billboards, ‘​Step inside an ambitious £500 million transformation of one of London’s most exciting areas’. ​We stood quietly with the residents waiting to be evicted, for the coming ‘third phase’ of the development. The demolition signifies the death of generosity. ​what we were trying to do was too good for the people that were going to live in it.” -Georgina Rowlands, 2019 #cvdazzle #surveillance #facialrecognition #thedazzleclub A post shared by  The Dazzle Club (@thedazzleclub) on Oct 23, 2019 at 7:32am PDT  London is the second-most monitored city in the world after Beijing, with more than 600,000 surveillance cameras in operation, and the average Londoner filmed around 300 times a day. In 2016, London’s Metropolitan police began trialing facial recognition technology to monitor and apprehend people outside Tube stations, at the annual Notting Hill Carnival and a Remembrance Sunday parade in commemoration of World War I. According to a review of the Carnival trial by privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch, the technology wrongly flagged innocent people 98% of the time. “No other European country has a face surveillance epidemic like the UK, aligning us with the likes of China rather than our democratic counterparts,” said Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch. “There is an element of tricking the AI,” says Roderick. The group is using the ‘CV dazzle’ method, created by the Brooklyn artist Adam Harvey. The technique dupes facial recognition cameras by blotting out the nose, deforming the eyebrows and warping the eyeline. Roderick adds a blue dot to her subject’s face. “These systems are still quite stupid. It’s mad that you can just paint your face in this way and suddenly the technology can’t function anymore,” she says. I wasn’t planning to join in, but suddenly I’m swishing paint onto my own face in what I’d call an “expressionist” style, going for black, orange and red in garish combination. The result is clownish; not exactly the ethereal look the rest of the group have managed to achieve. As we swipe paint across our features, we test the results using our smartphones. We use face detection filters, like Snapchat’s, to see if the camera can still recognize us as a human. It’s a satisfying moment when it can’t. Roderick, alongside her co-founder Georgina Rowlands, 23, began practicing this method three years ago while they were art students at London’s Central St Martins school of Art. “We just sat in the studio just trying to paint our faces and make it function,” she said. “It was quite fun just looking at Snapchat and trying to get it to stop working.” Roderick and Rowlands founded the Dazzle Club so that other people could learn, too.

File photo by Johannes Eisele/AFP BEIJING, China – China announced Friday, January 24, it will close a section of the Great Wall and other famous Beijing landmarks to control the spread of a deadly virus that has infected hundreds of people across the country. A range of Lunar New Year festivities have been cancelled to try to contain the virus, and Beijing's Forbidden City and Shanghai's Disneyland have also been closed temporarily. The Ming Tombs and Yinshan Pagoda will also be closed from Saturday, January 25, the authority that oversees the sites said, while the Bird's Nest stadium – the site of the 2008 Olympic Games – was shuttered from Friday. The Great Wall attracts around 10 million tourists a year and is a popular destination for visitors during the New Year holiday. The Juyongguan section will close, while the Great Wall temple fair was cancelled at the Simatai section of the famous landmark. Tourists at the Gubei water town by the Simatai section will have their temperature tested, the authority said in a statement on the WeChat social media app. The Bird's Nest will be closed until January 30 in order to ""prevent and control"" the spread of the virus, authorities said. An ice and snow show taking place on the pitch will be closed. The measures in the capital are the latest to try and control the outbreak of the new coronavirus, after authorities rapidly expanded a mammoth quarantine effort that affected 41 million people in central Hubei province. The previously unknown virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Although there have only been 29 confirmed cases in Beijing, city authorities have cancelled large-scaled Lunar New Year events this week. The city government said it would call off events including two popular temple fairs, which have attracted massive crowds of tourists in past years. Beijing's Forbidden City – which saw 19 million visitors last year – is usually packed with tourists during the Lunar New Year festival, when hundreds of millions of people travel across China. – Rappler.com "
412,250126,"February 01, 2020",Philippines,Depression among OFWs: 'The struggle is real',Jojo Dass,"OFWs are vulnerable to depression as they live away from their families and have to overcome language and cultural barriers, say experts   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates – Many overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) suffer from varying levels of depression because they carry “trigger factors” when they leave the Philippines to work abroad. Philippine consulate officials and  Filipino psychologists here said such factors include marital issues, financial problems, missed career opportunities, concerns over work demand, and conflicts due to language barriers. OFWs also have no family support network that they can depend on. Social Welfare Attaché Judith Yadan Bacwaden, who has handled around 20 cases in Dubai and Abu Dhabi since she assumed her post almost two years ago, said most of her involved OFWs with a history of depression even before they left the Philippines. “Majority sa mga kaso, hindi lang dito nag-umpisa. May mga problem na tinatakasan sa Pilipinas tapos nagpunta dito, nagkaroon ng hindi magandang karanasan kaya na-trigger (A majority of the cases didn't develop depression here. They had problems in the Philippines that they were running away from, then they had a bad experience here which triggered it),” Bacwaden said. Labor Attaché Felicitas Bay, for her part, said that depression among OFWs may be attributed to personal issues they've had prior to working abroad. ""The fear or apprehension that one cannot provide adequately for the family, cannot address marital or family concerns, or the current employment is not what was offered and the job left at home was better than the current – these will affect the state of mind of OFWs,"" Bay added. She said loneliness and homesickness are also “contributory factors to depression especially for first-time OFWs.” Bacwaden said that in the UAE, depressed OFWs are referred to a particular hospital’s psychiatric care and later repatriated if given the all-clear. “We have to ensure na magaling na, then diretso na for repatriation. Nakikipag-ugnayan kami sa DWSD to contact the family and arrange a team para sa pagsalubong sa airport (We have to ensure that you are well, then we go straight to repatriation. We coordinate with the DSWD to contact the family and arrange a team to meet the OFW at the airport),” Bacwaden said. She said that she had come across cases that could be handled by social work intervention alone, but there are those who clearly require professional help. “'Pag nakita ko na tulala na…hindi na kumakain…hindi na nakaka-usap, iba na, then I recommend psychiatric care (It's a different case if you see them spaced out...not eating...can't be talked to, then I recommend psychiatric care),” Bacwaden said. Comfort zone is gone Psychologists interviewed agreed that Filipinos working abroad are more prone to episodes of depression than their counterparts back home. The main reason is that they usually do not have a strong support system – the were away from their loved ones and lived in the company of peers who also have their share of anxieties working in a foreign land. Psychologist Djonde Frega Ariz-Antiado, who teaches psychology in Dubai, said losing one’s comfort zone is a major factor. “Overseas Filipino workers regardless of gender and occupation, generally leave their comfort zone, including the significant support systems, which is their family, in search of better life for financial stability and better employment opportunity,” said Antiado, who regularly conducts counselling to OFWs during outreach missions, including those who seek help at the Philippine Consulate General’s Office (PCGO). “The loss of this significant support network causes a major stressor,” she pointed out. Dr Rommel Sergio, Psychology Associate Professor at Canadian University Dubai who also holds regular counselling for distressed migrant Filipinos, said OFWs are more vulnerable to depression because they are usually beset with problems. “Depression is an extremely complex mental disease. It can happen to anyone especially if confounded with problems in the family, work, and personal life,” said Sergio, a recipient of the 2016 Presidential Award for Filipino Individuals and Organizations Overseas. ""Hence, if one has been exposed to different circumstances and the emotional intelligence is weak, he or she can be stressed and eventually be depressed,"" he added. Dr Maria Jolit Angeline Malaya, school psychologist at St Mary’s Catholic High School-Muhainah, said it’s all about how OFWs face challenges. “OFWs are among the ones most likely to suffer from depression owing to physical, mental and emotional challenges that living and working abroad bring,” said Malaya, a mental health advocate who regularly joins outreach counselling missions for OFWs. Aside from marital problems, homesickness, and financial  issues, OFWs also have to cope with their new environment where they may encounter an abusive employer, she said. Signs Malaya said signs and symptoms of depression include the feeling of helplessness and hopelessness, appetite or weight changes, loss of interest in daily activities, sleep changes, irritability, loss of energy, concentration problems, reckless behavior, unexpected aches and pains, as well as talking about killing or harming oneself. Sergio, for his part, said, ""Most clinically diagnosed depressed people have trouble in concentrating, remembering details, making decisions, restless, have feelings of guilt, feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, pessimism, hopelessness, insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or sleeping too much, overeating or appetite loss, and suicidal thoughts or attempts.” Antiado said a recent survey of the International Journal Mental Health indicated that expatriates experience a high degree of stress which in turn disrupts their social and emotional wellbeing and exposes them to greater risk of mental health problems. “Meeting work demands – Filipinos do multi-tasking; conflicts due to language barriers; absence of family support network and uncertain job security. All these contribute to the vulnerability of OFWs to depression,” she said. Antiado said signs or symptoms of depression can be categorized as follows: Sergio said other factors that can increase an OFW’s risk for depression include a family history of depression, certain medical conditions and medications, substance use, childhood trauma, life stress, and poor self-esteem. Who are most vulnerable? Antiado said the results of a recent World Health Organization (WHO) “indicated that those who earned least and who had least control of their jobs tended to be more depressed.” Antiado said WHO surveys and current researches “indicate that women are more prone to depression; and is more pronounced between the ages 18 to 44.” “Most of the jobs of female OFWs are domestic helpers which is characterized as a 24/7 job where they risk facing different forms of abuse. Due to depression, we read news of OFWs jumping off the windows and the like,” she said. Malaya said OFWs who experience physicial and empotional forms of domestic violence become runaways and seek help from the Philippine consulate. “I had several encounters with them and it is really happening most especially among domestic helpers who decided to leave our home country for the sake of providing for their loved ones,"" she said. 'Overwhelming' number Sergio said that based on her experience, it's not uncommon to meet an OFW in the UAE suffering from depression. “Marami sila, magkakaiba ng edad at kasarian (There's a lot of them, from different ages and gender). I am also doing private consulting through counseling and the figures of people having depression are really overwhelming,” he said. Malaya said nobody is safe from depression. “Anyone can have it, most especially OFWs. We cannot be free of depression especially if things in our lives are not balanced and when life strikes us with problems and unexpected events,” she said. What can be done Sergio advised OFWs feeling depressed to seek professional help as soon as possible. “Consult an expert once they have seen the signs of depression. It is so important that one consults a psychologist so that proper intervention can be done. As they say, prevention is better than cure. It is good to detect clinically the depressive episodes so as to save lives of our compatriots,” Sergio said. Malaya said OFWs should prepare themselves for anticipated problems while living abroad. ""The most important thing is to accept that you go abroad wholeheartedly. OFWs need to be prepared with loneliness, homesickness and hard work.” She said one can help prevent the onset of depression through a number of ways,  including exercise, continued good communication with family, developing friendships at the workplace, setting a definite timeline on one's stay abroad, and getting community support. Labor Attaché Bay also suggested engaging in community, church, or company activities. – Rappler.com  "

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg (C) marches during a 'Friday for future' youth demonstration in a street of Davos on January 24, 2020 on the sideline of the World Economic Forum annual meeting. Photo by Fabrice Coffrini/AFP DAVOS, Switzerland – Teenage activist Greta Thunberg on Friday, January 24, said activists' calls on the corporate and political elite at Davos to seriously fight climate change had been ""completely ignored,"" but vowed not to be subdued by stinging personal criticism from the Trump administration. The 50th edition of the annual Swiss Alps forum wrapped up with the menace of climate change – which UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned could leave humanity ""doomed"" – hammered into the minds of participants but doubt over whether any concrete action would be forthcoming. Thunberg, 17, whose school strike movement had inspired a generation of young people to pressure governments over their inaction, had told the World Economic Forum (WEF) she wanted to see an immediate end to investment in fossil fuels. ""Before we came here we had a few demands for this WEF. Of course these demands have been completely ignored. We expected nothing less,"" Thunberg told reporters in the ski resort on the last day of the conference. ""As long as the science is being ignored – as the facts are not being taken into account – and as long as the situation is not being treated as a crisis, then world and business leaders can, of course, continue to ignore the situation. ""They do not have to do anything as they are not being held accountable,"" she lamented before joining other young people in one of her regular ""Fridays for Future"" protests in Davos. 'Has no effect' The Swede had emerged as one of the key figures of the Davos forum, warning ""our house is still on fire"" and prompting US President Donald Trump to grumble on his visit to the event about the ""perennial prophets of doom."" Her demand for an immediate halt to investment in fossil fuels also prompted a stingingly personal aside from US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday, January 23. ""Is she the chief economist? Who is she? I'm confused,"" Mnuchin said, emphasizing after a pause that this was a joke. ""After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us,"" he said. Asked about Mnuchin's comments, the Swede said: ""Of course it has no effect. We are being criticized like that all the time."" ""If we cared about that, we would not be able to do what we do. We put ourselves in the spotlight."" Mnuchin on Friday launched a new defense of US policy, insisting the Trump administration cared for the environment, but that problems should not be reduced to just climate change. ""Climate change is one of many issues"" affecting the environment, he said, adding Trump was a firm advocate of ""clean air and clean water."" He said the reason the US left the Paris climate agreement – which calls for blocking global warming at well below 2C, and 1.5C if possible – ""was not because we don't support the environment (but because) we thought it wasn't a fair and balanced agreement."" He added that there were other key global issues to worry about, notably that ""there's way too many people in the developing world"" without access to electricity and preventing the spread of epidemics in the next decades like the coronavirus. 'Not for change in discourse' The starkest warnings at the forum came from Britain's Prince Charles – who asked ""what good is all the extra wealth in the world...if you can do nothing with it, except watch it burn?"" – and Guterres. The UN chief warned that the world was losing the war against climate change and humanity's capacity ""to live in this planet"" will risk being destroyed. ""We need to act in order to make sure we are not doomed,"" he said. Another prominent climate change protest leader, German student Luisa Neubauer, acknowledged that some bold words had been heard at Davos, but deeds were now needed. ""We never striked for discourse change,"" said Neubauer, who this month turned down the offer of a board seat on a subsidiary of German industrial giant Siemens.

Last year's Samsung Galaxy S10 was the first Samsung to carry 5G functionality. Photo by Gelo Gonzales/Rappler  The 2020 Mobile World Congress is right around the corner, and that means it’s time for a new round of flagship phones from the world’s top brands. GALAXY S10. Last year's Samsung Galaxy S10 was the first Samsung to carry 5G functionality. Photo by Gelo Gonzales/Rappler  In recent years, the battle for consumer dollars have been in the budget to midrange tiers, with these affordable phones offering enough smoothness for, well, those who just want a solid daily driver that won’t take months to pay off. Still, the flagships remain a star attraction. If money is no object, their combination of premium materials, and unique, new features is hard to resist for the true-blue technophile. In the first half of 2020, here are the 4 flagships we’re looking at. They’ll officially be unveiled soon, so before that, here’s how they’re shaping up according to the online community: Huawei P40 Pro Last year’s P30 Pro made waves with its zooming capabilities made possible through a combination of hardware (a periscope design that allowed increased optical zoom range within the tiny confines of the phone) and software (computational AI that enhanced photos based on what it knows how a scene is supposed to look like.) Improvements one would hope for are better stabilitization and less noise levels when using the top end of the zoom range. Image leaks also show the phone with more cameras: 5 on the rear, and 2 on the front. Last year, the P30 Pro had a triple-camera setup on the back, and one selfie cam. P40 PHONES. Several variants of the alleged P40 phones from Huawei as leaked by Evan Blass. Photo from Evan Blass/Twitter P40 PHONES. Several variants of the alleged P40 phones from Huawei as leaked by Evan Blass. Photo from Evan Blass/Twitter The Huawei Kirin 990 chipset, which is the first model to combine the processor and the 5G modem on one chip, will also debut in the P40 Pro. Executives have said that there is a chance that P40 Pro may ship with Huawei’s own HarmonyOS, depending on the situation involving US and China ties. Samsung Galaxy S20 First of all, the name. Last year, we had the S10, but it appears Samsung is changing up the nomenclature. With the iPhone 11 and the Huawei P30 around, releasing an S11 may sound like an older unit, so that could be one reason for the name change. Expected as firsts for the line: a 120hz screen, the Samsung Exynos 990 chipset, 10x optical zoom and 100x digital zoom (S10 had 2x optical zoom and 8x digital zoom), 8K 30fps recording, a 40MP front camera, 16GB of RAM, and a 108MP main camera. As usual, some variants in other regions will be powered by a Snapdragon 865 instead of Samsung’s in-house 865. Three models are rumored: a regular S20, an S20+, and an S20 Ultra – all of which will have 5G baked in. OPPO Find X2 When OPPO released the Reno last year, many thought that would replace the Find flagship released in 2018. But as it turns out, the Find will continue as a line of its own with OPPO expected to unveil the Find X2 at MWC. FIND X. OPPO's flagship from 2018 was among the first to implement a sliding body to eliminate the need for a notched screen. Photo from OPPO Like the S20, it is expected to have a 120Hz screen and a Snapdragon 865 chipset – which means it will have 5G. As reported by Android Authority, this may also be one of the first phones to use a new Sony image sensor, which will have significant boosts in focusing, resolution, sensitivity, and dynamic range. OPPO is also reportedly looking at a Q1 2020 release date for the phone like the Galaxy S20 phones, with Huawei’s P flagships releasing in late Q1/early Q2. At first, there were rumors that the phone will be coming with an under-display camera, with OPPO showcasing the technology in late 2019, but OPPO has since confirmed that the tech won’t be coming in the Find X2. The Find was known for its bold, fluid design back in 2018, so the physical design of the X2 is one of the things we’re looking forward to seeing. Among the four in the list, the Find X2 is the dark horse. Huawei's P phones have their cutting-edge cameras. Samsung's Galaxy S phones look the most sophisticated, backed by a strong, if somewhat conservative, set of new features. Xiaomi lets you get your hands on the best processor without breaking the bank. It'll be interesting to see how the X2 finds a way to stand out given the current lay of the land. Xiaomi Mi 10 Another brand to look out for is Xiaomi, which has consistently undercut its rivals with aggressive pricing. Last year, their Xiaomi Mi 9 offered a flagship Snapdragon 855-equipped phone at at least half the price of the cheapest Samsung S10. This year, Xiaomi is expected to continue that trend with the Snapdragon 865. The design will also continue to be much more low-key than flagships from OPPO, Huawei, and Samsung. But aside from the processor, Xiaomi also tries not to lag behind the camera wars, with the Mi 10 expected to have high-resolution cameras that don’t do anything too fancy but will be solid for everyday use. It’s expected to be unveiled in China in early February before MWC begins. With an 865 chip, that means the Mi 10 may be one of the cheapest ways to get a 5G-capable phone this year. Rumors also point to a screen with at least a 90Hz refresh rate, slightly slower than the ones from OPPO and Samsung. – Rappler.com   "

But only a few are butt selfies. For it takes a different kind of courage for people to bare their butts at tourist attractions. An American couple known for their Instagram account “Travelling Butts” was arrested two years ago for mooning Wat Arun (aka Temple of the Sun) in Bangkok. In 2019, a Czech social influencer angered Indonesian netizens when she washed her butt with holy water from a temple in Bali. In Abra, 4 local boys decided to bare their butts in front of the Apao Hills in Tineg town. They posted several of their butt selfies on Facebook to “welcome 2020.” Their posts, however, drew the ire of many Abrenos to the point that the mayor of Tineg crafted a statement regarding what she called “obscene” photographs. “Such conduct was not only deplorable as it was utterly done in bad taste, as it shows their behind(s) for all the netizens to see. But what was more appalling is that they used our beloved Apao Rolling Hills that was degraded by these persons with their lewdness,” Mayor Corinthia Dannang Crisologo wrote. Although the hills are not sacred, she said the young men’s pose showed “utter lack of respect [for] the conservative culture and traditions of the people of Tineg.” Crisologo called on them to take down their post, which the boys did. The one who posted also apologized. “We just had a little fun and didn’t do it to harm people and desecrate a tourist spot,” he wrote in Filipino. “Right now, we are full of fear and cannot eat well because of the criticism from the social media. We cannot even leave our houses for fear of retaliation,” he said “We hope we would be forgiven by the town and their people who saw our posts,” he added. Apao Hills is Abra’s answer to the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, as the rolling hills turn brown during the dry season and emerald green during the rains.

President Rodrigo Duterte salutes officers of the Philippine Navy at the Port Area in Manila on January 14, 2020. File photo from Malacañang MANILA, Philippines – Downplaying the likelihood of the Philippines asserting its rights in the West Philippine Sea during this administration, President Rodrigo Duterte said he would instead leave it up to time and economic cooperation when dealing with China's expansive claims in the maritime area. ""We might as well just be friendly, improve our commerce, and let time heal. Tomorrow will take care of itself, (that's) one thing for sure and like any other historical claim, the world is always changing and we did not really do it at the expense of the lives of Filipinos,"" Duterte said in an interview with Russian news outlet RT News that aired on Friday, January 24. Before making the statement, Duterte again refused to take an aggressive stand similar to other Southeast Asian countires such as Vietnam when asserting the country's rights in the West Philippine Sea. Like the Philippines, Vietnam is a claimant state in the South China Sea and actively defends its waters against China's aggressive tactics to claim the entire maritime area. (READ: [ANALYSIS] Will Vietnam take China to court?) In declining to take a similar approach to Vietnam, Duterte stuck to the line that asserting the Philippines' rights in the West Philippine Sea would only make China declare war. It's a false option that experts such as retired Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio – a staunch defender of the West Philippine Sea – have refuted, saying Duterte's insistence on such is a ""hollow attempt to scare our people into submission to China."" Carpio, who played a pivotal role in securing the Philippines' victory against China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, earlier said Duterte's projection of war ""shows a dismal lack of understanding of international law and international relations."" The Philippines and China have engaged in talks on the sea dispute since May 2017, though critics and maritime experts have pointed out that these have not stopped China's militarization in the South China Sea; the buildup of artificial islands in Philippine waters; and aggressive tactics against fishermen, among others. Duterte has likewise been criticized for downplaying the Philippines' decades-long sea dispute in exchange for loans and grants from Beijing. Seeking new friends. Duterte was also asked why he sought for a change in the Philippines' foreign policy characterized by turning away from traditional allies such as the United States to countries like Russia and China instead. Duterte said there was nothing to it except that Russia and China ""respected"" other countries' sovereignty. He placed the two countries against the US, whom he believed still viewed the Philippines as a vassal state. ""If I cannot get a credible posture from the Americans, I can get it from the Russians and the Chinese government.

Duterte has frequently expressed his dislike for the United States, particularly under the administration of former president Barack Obama, who was critical of his war on drugs. Even with the assumption of US President Donald Trump, who he described as a ""very nice person,"" Duterte repeatedly lashed out at America for ""interfering"" in the Philippines' affairs. The latest escalation of his tirades against the US saw Duterte renew threats to scrap the Philippines-US long-standing visiting forces agreement, which outlined guidelines for the conduct of American troops visiting the Philippines. He also threatened to deny entry to more US senators who approved a measure seeking sanctions against Philippine officials involved in extrajudicial killings and the detention of Senator Leila de Lima. – Rappler.com "

He had initially manifested ""pneumonia-like symptoms"" like fever, coughs, colds, and chills but is currently no longer feverish, according to the DOH. The Philippines' Research Institute for Tropical Medicine had already ruled out the coronaviruses that cause SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) before sending the child's laboratory samples to the Australian institute. They will have to run another test to rule out pancoronavirus before the child may be discharged from the hospital, the DOH said. The DOH remains on high alert as the death toll in China due to the virus rose on Friday. The health department said its Bureau of Quarantine is working closely with airlines and airport authorities to ensure stricter border surveillance. The health department's emergency response has also been activated; the DOH is to coordinate with other agencies like the Department of the Interior and Local Government and its regional counterparts to cascade information regarding the virus and strengthen community engagement.

Roger Federer barges to the fourth round of the Australian Open. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Six-time champion Roger Federer survived an epic five-set marathon to seal his 100th Australian Open win Friday, January 24, fending off a huge challenge from John Millman. The Swiss master was rattled by the all-guns-blazing Australian, but finally scraped past him, 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (10/8), to stay alive in his quest for a 21st Grand Slam title. He will now take on unseeded Hungarian Marton Fucsovics, who eased past American Tommy Paul in straight sets, for a place in the last eight. ""It was tough tonight, thank God it was a super breaker,"" said the No. 3 seed, who looked out for the count when he was down 8-4 in the best-of-10 fifth set super tiebreaker. ""He played a great match – I can't even speak any more."" ""It came down to the wire. I was getting ready to explain myself in the press conference. What a match."" ""This one was unique in many ways that I was able to turn a super breaker around like this in an atmosphere, it was crazy, fun, and I couldn't be more happy. Big relief."" ""Things were extremely difficult, not just in the breaker, (but) throughout the match for me against John,"" he added. Millman said he ""left it all out there"" and praised Federer, saying: ""That's what the best players I guess do."" The win handed him not only a 100th victory at Melbourne Park but gave him the distinction of becoming the only player, man or woman, to post a century of victories at two different Slams. Federer also notched 3 figures at Wimbledon last year. He is 1 of 4 four players in the 100 club – Martina Navratilova at Wimbledon, and Chris Evert, and Serena Williams at the US Open are the others. But it nearly did not happen against the 47th ranked Australian Millman, who memorably beat Federer over 4 gruelling sets in the round of 16 at the US Open in 2018. One of the fittest players on tour, Millman matched Federer game for game in the opening set until the ninth, when he pounced, converting a second break point when he pounded a forehand winner. The 38-year-old Federer was struggling to find his rhythm and quickly found himself 5-2 down. He then easily held serve before breaking back with a phenomenal backhand down the line as Millman was serving for the set. But Federer then blew it, broken to love thanks to poor serving to hand Millman a one-set lead. Millman was serving well and cracking big forehands, while Federer did not have any answers, with the 2nd set going to serve until a crucial tiebreak when the Swiss stepped up in the pressure-cooker atmosphere, taking his game to another level. With his confidence restored, he wrestled control of the 3rd set, but Millman refused to give up and came roaring back, excelling in the baselines rallies to break for a 4-3 lead and take the match into a deciding 5th set. They shared breaks in the tense decider and it went to a tiebreak with Federer looking dead and buried at 8-4 down. But he stayed calm and somehow hauled himself back to win a Grand Slam classic. – Rappler.com "

Many of the participating barangays in Pandacan, Manila set up reading spaces at the daycare section of their barangay hall, where children and other people can walk in and borrow books. Photo by Noel Alido MANILA, Philippines – There are countless stories and lessons to be found in books, enough for people to describe reading as dreaming with open eyes. Books can be expensive and not everyone can afford to buy them. Public libraries can help address this problem but in the Philippines, libraries are few, intimidating, and not so accessible to poor communities. (READ: Filipinos barely know if there are libraries near their homes) In Pandacan, the cultural group Samahang Sining at Kultura ng Pilipinas (SSKPil) and church-based New Covenant Prayer Community (NCPC) sought out barangay and youth leaders to create a solution. Why not establish mini-libraries in barangay centers, which are normally open to constituents the entire day? In early 2019, the two groups launched the Munting Aklatan sa Barangay (small community library) or MAB project with 9 barangays in Pandacan, a small historic district in Manila. The two groups solicited books in various fiction and non-fiction genres from friends and other people, and turned them over to Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) and barangay officers so they can set up reading spaces in their respective barangay centers. The project aims to create a pool of barangay educators that will manage the libraries and organize learning activities. It hopes to encourage residents to walk in and read or borrow books for pleasure or reading requirements. Access to books, a human and legal right  TRAINING. Teacher-librarian and award-winning author Zarah Gagatiga conducts a training on basic library management for barangay and SK members in Pandacan. Photo by Michelle Ciriacruz Teacher-librarian and award-winning author Zarah Gagatiga pointed out that underRepublic Act No. 7743, the Philippine government has to establish and fund city and municipal libraries as well as barangay reading centers. She added that grassroots access to libraries is part of Filipinos’ right to education and a tool to fight poverty. Gagatiga is the public relations officer of the Philippine Association of School Librarians and currently represents the library sector in the Philippine Board on Books for Young People. “A purpose of a library is to elevate the reading taste, open up new patterns of thinking, encourage us to imagine and see other worlds. Barangays need to see that having reading centers is valuable for economic growth. Information is economic power,” she explained. Gagatiga, who has been providing basic library system and maintenance training to the barangays involved in the MAB project, suggested that barangays should collect government publications like ordinances and make them accessible to everyone. “It’s important to know existing laws and policies. MAB can help make this information accessible to the barangays,” she said. She described MAB as an ambitious project– a global idea of library-building in a local setting. The challenge is to sustain it, which is why it is important to get the support of the local government units, she added. Barangay reading centers as a safe place for the community Before MAB, SSKPil was managing a community library in the patio of Pandacan’s Sto Niño Church in 2012. However, they had to close it in 2018 when the new church administration decided to use the space for another purpose. Instead of donating the books to the district or city library, the NCPC proposed to distribute the books and shelves to barangays instead. Thus the idea of the MAB was born, bringing the library closer to the people.  With members who are also barangay leaders, the groups were able to get the buy-in of 9 barangays including youth leaders. SSKPil will handle the acquisition of books and resource partners. NCPC will monitor and supervise the project, while barangay educators will manage the reading centers. Many of the barangays set up the reading spaces at the daycare section of their barangay hall. These are the barangays that participated: 870, 871, 872, 867, 859, 864, 836, 835 and 837. Through the MAB, SK Chair Joven Rivera said the youth can be empowered by what they learn and read. “Magkakaroon ang mga kabataan ng ligtas na lugar kung saan puwede nilang ipakita kung ano ang meron sila (Our youth will have a safe place where they can cultivate their skills),"" Rivera said. NCPC member and barangay kagawad Juliet Romano agreed.  “My barangay beside the railroad tracks is home to many indigents. We have a program where we teach about 20 children good manners and conduct and the Word of God. A barangay reading center can be a good place for us to hold storytelling activities,” she said. Romano said the MAB project also represented hope. “My barangay faces demolition because of a road-widening project. Life is challenging but I feel positive because we come up with inspiring projects,” she shared. “Nangangarap ako na darating ang panahon kung saan ang mga bata naman ang magiging guro sa susunod na henerasyon (I dream of a future where the children we teach now will someday become teachers themselves).” LESSON.

Cardiño shared that the MAB is organizing a calendar of fun learning activities for children in 2020 to encourage them to read. (READ: [OPINION] Raising the scores in reading comprehension through book clubs) Small project with big potential SSKPil and NCPC are inviting partners to help support the needs of the project. Funds are needed to improve the administration and infrastructure of the libraries. Some barangays do not have bookcases, while others are able to provide only a desk and a few chairs for readers. ""Our small community libraries should serve as wells of knowledge, a kind of informal education as well as a good source of leisure, for Pandacan residents. Through the MAB, books will now reach the hands of children and adults at the grassroots level of our communities,"" shared SSKPil Board Member Sixto Carlos.

Contrary to Duterte's claims, Rappler is 100% Filipino-owned, and the CIA is not one of its funders.

RT anchor Murad Gazdiev asked: ""Your recent absence during the Taal volcano eruption and people have been worried, there has been widespread concern about that absence and about your health.

Rappler has not published a news report claiming Duterte's absence in areas affected by the Taal Volcano eruption. In fact, Rappler reported on each of his visits so far and on the plans as well as response planned for the ongoing disaster. On January 14, Rappler reported Duterte's announcement that he would visit communities affected by the Taal Volcano eruption, despite warnings from his doctor about the potential hazard of volcanic ashfall. This was mentioned in an ambush interview with reporters after he appeared before the Philippine Marine Corps on the night of January 13, a day after the volcano erupted. On the night of January 14, Rappler again reported on Duterte's first visit to affected areas as well as the situation briefing held with concerned agencies in Batangas City. Rappler also has an updated list of Duterte's absences and skipped events, which does not list any scrapped visit to residents or areas affected by the eruption of Taal Volcano.

The European capitals triggered the complaint mechanism last week after Tehran took a series of steps away from its commitments, in protest at the US pulling out of the accord in 2018. This could have shortened the deal's lifespan but Josep Borrell, the EU's diplomatic chief, who is tasked with convening meetings under the dispute mechanism, has called new talks. Borrell said he had consulted the countries still in the deal – which also include Russia and China – and that all are determined to save the accord. The Iran nuclear deal has been crumbling since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, prompting the Islamic republic to announce a series of steps away from its commitments. ""Notwithstanding differences on modalities, there is agreement that more time is needed due to the complexity of the issues involved. The timeline is therefore extended,"" Borrell said in a statement. ""All agreed to pursue expert-level discussions addressing the concerns regarding nuclear implementation, as well as the wider impacts of the withdrawal of the United States from the JCPOA and its reimposition of sanctions."" JCPOA is an acronym for the deal's formal title, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Borrell said the so-called joint commission that oversees the deal and comprises representatives of all the countries involved will meet in February, though he did not give a precise date. It usually meets in Vienna, though it can also meet in New York or Geneva. Room for maneuver Under the terms of the dispute mechanism, senior officials have 15 days from the January 14 triggering of the complaint mechanism to find a solution before deciding whether to escalate the issue to foreign ministers level. By calling the meeting in February, Borrell has extended that initial timeline – which was conceived to solve technical complaints rather than the slow political collapse of the accord. European officials say a certain amount of creative ambiguity was deliberately written into the text to allow room for maneuver in a crisis, and it now looks likely the dispute process could be prolonged for quite some time. When they triggered the mechanism, the Europeans urged Iran to come back into full compliance with its obligations under the 2015 accord, which gave Tehran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program aimed at preventing it from developing atomic weapons. But, privately, diplomats recognize it is highly unlikely Iran will do this without substantial concessions in return – such as an end to US sanctions or Europe taking measures to offset their economic impact. Instead they will be content if talks manage to convince Iran not to take any more steps away from the deal, giving space for back-channel diplomacy aimed at an agreement that gets both Washington and Tehran back in the game. ""We want to get round a table to work out what is the fix to get us into a stable place where things won't get worse,"" one diplomat said. ""It might be possible to get informal agreement on restraint."" Bomb 'not around the corner' After repeated warnings, Germany, Britain and France triggered the dispute process on January 14 after Iran announced it would no longer observe limits on the number of centrifuges – used to enrich uranium – in its fifth step back from the deal. But crucially Iran has said it will continue to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) which carries out regular detailed inspections on the ground. A western diplomat said that, for the Europeans, it was ""critical that is maintained."" ""The IAEA still has full access, which gives us reassurance about the activities the Iranians are doing. Agency access, verification and monitoring give us confidence that we would know if the Iranian activities are changing in nature,"" the diplomat said. For now the Europeans are looking to get Iran back on board rather than reimposing sanctions, and they are keenly aware that they could lose control of the dispute process if it moves to the next stage – notifying the UN Security Council. If this happens, UN sanctions automatically ""snap back"" after 30 days unless the Security Council votes to stop them – and here the US would be able to wield its veto. ""They've broken the limits, we're watching. A bomb is not around the corner but we don't want to get to that,"" a diplomat said. – Rappler.com "

Passengers wear protective masks to protect against the spread of the coronavirus as they arrive at the Los Angeles International Airport, California, on January 22, 2020. File photo by Mark Ralston/AFP WASHINGTON DC, USA – A woman in Chicago in her 60s was Friday, January 24, confirmed as the second patient on US soil infected with a deadly new virus originating in China, health officials said, with 50 other suspected cases under investigation. The contagion has so far claimed 26 lives in China, sickened hundreds and has spread across several Asian countries as well as the US. ""I'm pleased to report she is clinically doing well and is in stable condition,"" said Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health of the new patient. Nancy Messonier, senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the agency had so far tested 63 samples from patients across 22 US states for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Eleven were found to be negative and two positive, and the CDC was working to make diagnosis kits more nationally available. At present the testing is occurring at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The Chicago patient had traveled to Wuhan in late December before returning to the US on January 13, Arwady said, a few days before health screenings began at major airports for travelers originating from the central Chinese city that is at the center of the outbreak. She began experiencing symptoms and called her health care providers, and was later admitted to hospital and placed in isolation. ""She has not taken public transportation, have not attended any large gatherings and, she has not had extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning from China,"" added Arwady. The US confirmed its first case of the infection earlier this week, a man in his thirties from Washington state who had also traveled to Wuhan recently and also reported himself to authorities after developing mild symptoms. Neither of the cases were detected by the airport screenings that began on January 17, said CDC official Martin Cetron, and both patients had no symptoms or fever when they first arrived in the US. China has placed a travel ban across a vast region encompassing 13 cities and more than 40 million people, and the US was now ""reevaluating"" its approach of carrying out airport screenings, added Cetron. The previously unknown virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. – Rappler.com "

In this photo from October 9, 2019, the Philippine Marines and US forces open the 3rd KAMANDAG joint exercises at Subic Bay International Airport. Photo by Nappy Manegdeg/Rappler.com MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines can “unilaterally” initiate the termination of its visiting forces agreement with the United States, consistent with President Rodrigo Duterte’s threat, according to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana. It doesn’t need congressional approval either, he added. In a statement on Friday night, January 24, Lorenzana said, “[It] is well within the right of the Philippine government to do so if it determines that the agreement no longer redounds to our national interest.” Still, Lorenzana said he would “discuss with the President the various scenarios concerning the possible termination of the VFA and what future actions may be undertaken by the DND Department of National Defense) and the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) regarding this matter.” The defense chief said he was constantly consulting with Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, who earlier said it was a “good move” on the part of Duterte to threaten to scrap the military pact in response to the cancellation of Senator Ronald dela Rosa’s American visa. Locsin tweeted that he had started “terminating” the VFA, while Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said his department is studying the “proper procedure to terminate the VFA.” Lorenzana, in his statement, said: “All that is required is that a notice of termination be served to the US government. The termination shall take effect 180 days after the date of the notice.” Dela Rosa’s visa is believed to have been canceled because of his involvement in the extrajudicial killings related to the Duterte administration’s war on drugs. Dela Rosa was previously the chief of the national police, the architect of the drug war. Under the Magnitsky Act, the US can deny entry to people suspected of human rights violations in their own countries. Some have opposed the scrapping of the VFA, including Senator Panfilo Lacson, who had cited the benefits of continued technical assistance from the US under the VFA, especially in Philippine efforts against terrorists. US assistance led to the neutralization of  Malaysian Zulkifli bin Hir, one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted terrorists, in 2015; and Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Sabaya in 2002.  – Rappler.com "

442,250157,"January 26, 2020",Science Solitaire,The germs among us,Maria Isabel Garcia,"'Panicking is a normal reaction to the discovery of a virus, but we have to try harder as the general public to respond'   It was easier for us to understand the heavens than to fathom what is inside our bodies. We already understood for the most part how objects, including the planets, move and stayed still before we understood germs. Isaac Newton had already laid this out in the late 1600s. But it was only in the 1800s that we had definitively found and accepted that there was tiny “stuff” in the air (some we consider as “living” and some we are not sure qualifies as “living”) that cause sickness in plants and animals (humans are animals even if we forget this a lot) and that they reproduce inside us and spread through different ways. The size of a human hair is about 75,000 nanometers. Bacteria is about 1000 nanometers. But a virus is only 20-400 nanometers. This is one of the reasons why it is very difficult to treat a viral disease – you have to come up with ingenious ways to first see it, and then devise incredibly tiny filters to catch it and then attack it. Bacteria and viruses are among the “stuff” that scientists call “pathogens” (“pathos” which means “feeling” or “suffering” and “gen” which means “born”) – those that cause diseases. The 5 kinds of pathogens are viruses, protozoa, bacteria, fungi, and worms. The smallest of these are viruses. Bacteria was discovered before viruses, because scientists until the end of the 1800’s had found ways to make tiny filters that could catch bacteria, but were surprised to find that infection still persisted. This could only be so because what was causing the infection may have been a lot smaller. Bacteria could be seen through a “regular” microscope. This kind of microscope had its beginnings in 1590 and went through great improvements, including the one by Galileo in 1609. Robert Hooke, the one who coined the term “cell” in 1665, also had a hand in it, as did Leeuwenhoek in the 1670’s – he was the one who first described “spermatozoa” when he saw it through his self-designed high-powered single lens microscope. Robert Koch in 1882 also designed the bacteria that could cause tuberculosis. But a virus could only reveal itself through an electron microscope, and this was not invented until 1931 by Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll. Viruses could be considered the weirdest among the 5 pathogens because they do not have their own cells. And if “cell” is how we define the “basic unit of life,” then they are not alive. As such, they do not have “cell walls.” But they move and reproduce by using the cells of the hosts that they invade. They can infect everything that have cells, including bacteria. Viruses move because they are like freelancers – they are not attached to any institutions, but they have “wifi,” literally wired with strands of RNA and DNA molecules which carry their own genetic material, protected by a protein coat and another layer of material. These are the ones that move in and wreak havoc inside cells. Viruses take on many shapes – like snowflakes. A coronavirus was named as such because when seen under an electron microscope, it has “crowns” like the sun’s crown. A flu virus, meanwhile, is spherical in shape. The shapes of the virus determine how a virus works and and attaches itself to host cells. A virus can find various ways to enter a life form through carriers: through coughing and sneezing, through fecal matter, b coming into contact with blood that has it, or by sexual contact.  When it enters a host, it will invade the cell, taking over that cell’s machinery so that it can reproduce itself. While a bacteria is specific to a disease (local), a viral infection spreads throughout your other cells (systemic). A disease caused by bacteria can be treated by antibiotics because antibiotics generally work by attacking the cell wall of the bacteria. As viruses do not have cell walls, there is nothing that antibiotics can do to treat viruses. Your own immune system generally would have to be the one to be strengthened so you could fight off the march of viruses in your own cells. For the nastier viruses like polio, measles, smallpox, and chickenpox, vaccination is the most effective way to prevent them. Vaccination is when a substance (the “foreign” chemical or the “good” twin of the virus) is formulated in such a way that when it is introduced into your own body, your own immune system will be on high alert and will be able to recognize the virus and fight it off with its own defense mechanism. Each kind of virus will call for its own kind of vaccine, because the latter will depend on the virus structure. Our immune system should be able to know it when it sees it and know the kind of “weapons” to use and to what extent they will be unleashed to destroy the virus. That is why it is so essential that when public health experts say they are still studying a virus, this includes the possibility of figuring out how soon they can come up with a vaccine. This is also why vaccination of the large majority of the population is paramount. Viruses will survive and flourish and spread if they find more and more people who have not been vaccinated. Once that happens, the viruses gain enough power to be an epidemic (throughout communities) or pandemic (throughout the world). As long as the vast majority has been vaccinated against these viruses, these viruses will be relatively silent. The newly discovered coronavirus that started in Wuhan, China seems to have come from animals, though they are not sure yet which animal it is and how they jumped to humans. They know this because a significant number of the people health experts examined were exposed to the meat market. They also know that it may be spreading because of coughing or sneezing, similar to the flu, as a good number tested have also been exposed to people with respiratory illness. Panicking is a normal reaction to the discovery of a virus, but we have to try harder as the general public to respond – which means you should wear a mask if you are in public places, and take the strictest precautions when in contact with animals. We should also listen to our local health officials as well as the World Health Organization. (READ: DOH says it's ready in case new coronavirus reaches PH) This is a chance for us to get to understand what a virus is, why vaccination is essential, and how science could be on your side regardless of your sketchy relationship with it when you were still in school – that is, on the side of life. – Rappler.com Maria Isabel Garcia is a science writer.

Every year, the parish of San Jose de Placer gives an affluent Ilonggo couple the title of Dinagyang hermano y hermana mayor. They serve as stewards of sorts of the image of the Señor Santo Niño for the duration of the Dinagyang Festival, leading the 9 nights of novena mass at the parish of San Jose de Placer and taking care of other affairs and occasions related to the Santo Niño.

Humble beginnings Coming from a humble background, the installation of the Zapantas marked a poignant turn in the history of Iloilo’s annual revelry in honor of the Santo Niño, as the trappings of the hermana and hermano are usually bestowed on well-off patriarchs and matriarchs of moneyed Ilonggo clans. Most notably, the first-ever Dinagyang hermano y hermana mayor were Dr Antonio and Rosa Ocondriz Caram, from a well-respected political family in Iloilo, who held the title and responsibility until 1975. A retired employee of the University of San Agustin in Iloilo, Zapanta admitted that she was shocked and hesitant at first to accept the role, given their family’s modest resources, but with the reassurance and support of her close circle in the Parish of San Jose de Placer, she relented and wholeheartedly took on the duty.

Zapanta said she wasn't prepared for the role but felt the call to do it. “But when you’re called on for such a responsibility, especially in the service of the Sto. Niño, refusing the honor is not an option. Thankfully, by God’s grace we’ve been able to fulfill our duty,” Zapanta said. (READ: IN PHOTOS: 2019 Dinagyang Festival) But instead of being caught completely off-guard by the honorable appointment, Zapanta took the once-in-a-lifetime responsibility that she considered a part of God’s serendipitous plans for her. Zapanta has been a loyal devotee of the Child Jesus for nearly 40 years. From 2012 to 2018, she also served as president of the Cofradia del Santo Niño de Cebu – Iloilo Chapter to share in the group’s primary mission in spreading the devotion to the Holy Child in the image of Señor Santo Niño. Zapanta also worked in various local religious organizations such as the Catholic Women’s League and the Cofradia del Santo Rosario. Tracing the roots Zapanta is the niece of the late Reverend Father Ambrosio Galindez, dubbed as the unimpeachable “Father of the Dinagyang.” Father Galindez, a highly respected clergyman, first received a replica of the image of the Señor Santo Niño de Cebu in 1968 – a gift from Father Sulpicio Enderes and a delegation of the Cofradia de Cebu. This image, now enshrined at the San Jose Parish Church across Plaza Libertad, inspired the church and the local government to adopt an “Ati-Atihan” festival in Iloilo City in honor of the Santo Niño. In 1977, after a decade of commemorating the festivity, the Iloilo City government and San Jose de Placer Parish decided to change the name of the festival in order to distinguish it from Kalibo’s Ati-Atihan.They called it “Dinagyang” as suggested by then broadcaster Pacifico Sudario, paving the way for the modern celebration observed every third Sunday of January today. To pay tribute to Galindez for his invaluable contributions to the Ilonggo faith and culture, a monument dedicated to the late father was erected in front of the Plaza Libertad, a stone’s throw away from his former parish church.  FAVOR. Dancers set to perform on Dinagyang Festival's dance competition approach the altar to be blessed by the Sto. Niño of San Jose de Placer Church. Photo by Rhick Llars Vladimer Albay Saved by the Santo Niño Zapanta said that her journey as a disciple of the Infant Jesus began in the early 1980s, when she regularly attended church services back when her uncle, Father Galindez, was still parish priest of the Parish of San Jose de Placer. However, in 1986, an unfortunate incident changed her devotion to the Santo Niño. Zapanta’s then 5-year-old child was rushed to the hospital for experiencing difficulty in breathing. After a series of procedures and tests, her child was diagnosed with advance meningococcemia, a life-threatening rare blood infection. She recounted that because her child was one of the first reported cases of meningococcemia in Iloilo during the mid-1980s, the doctors warned her that her child may only have 12 hours left to live even under intensive care. Vigilant and undaunted by the harrowing news, Zapanta decided to reach out to her brothers and sisters at the the Cofradia del Santo Niño for prayers for the health of her child, believing in the power of devotion to deliver her child from harm. “I believe the Santo Niño has a soft spot for children and the sick,"" Zapanta said in Ilonggo. Miraculously, her child survived the dreadful illness, showing signs of recovery after the first 12 hours in the hospital. Zapanta also shared that all her 3 children, in their early to late 30s, were also devotees of the Santo Niño and had families of their own. Since the traumatic incident, she dedicated a large portion of her time serving out of  gratitude for granting her child a new lease on life. “The divine Santo Niño has brought a lot of blessings into my life over the years. That’s why I have to give back tenfold, as thanksgiving for all the graces I’ve received,” she said. The couple, represented by their son Bryan Noel during the rite, were officially installed as the hermana y hermano mayor of the Dinagyang during a turnover ceremony at the San Jose de Placer Parish Church on January 15. As “elders” of the devotees of the Santo Niño, they will help in the activities of the parish  in line with the religious aspect of the 2020 edition of the festival.

Mayor Joy Salvame made the statement after some evacuees expressed their desire to move to Ibaan which is considered a safe zone.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said before the game that the NBA would return to Paris for ""many more years to come."" The Bucks were sluggish in the first half and trailed the Hornets until the end of the 3rd quarter, when George Hill slashed to the basket for an easy layup and reigning league Most Valuable Player Antetokounmpo imposed himself around the rim on the way to his impressive double-double. Malik Monk topscored for the Hornets with 31 points but the Eastern Conference-leading Bucks just had too many weapons and Antetokounmpo's powerful dunk with 5 minutes remaining was the sign that the game was effectively over as a contest. After a quiet start, the Greek playmaker, who will again captain against LeBron James in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, burst into life in the 2nd quarter when he wrestled the ball from Cody Zeller and reverse-slammed over the hapless Hornet. Antetokounmpo said the journey to Europe had taken its toll in the early stages. ""We didn't a play for 4 days, but that's no excuse,"" he said. ""We started the game and we weren't playing the basketball we usually play. Hopefully we can learn from this today and learn that they are not just going to give us the game, we have to fight for it."" He said the atmosphere in the Paris arena had been ""amazing,"" adding: ""It felt for everybody like we were playing at home."" Experienced Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe supplied the ammunition for Antetokounmpo and finished with 20 points himself. Nicolas Batum, the French national team captain whose presence in the Charlotte lineup helped ensure their involvement in this history-making game, had a quiet night with only 5 points, but his every move was cheered loudly by his compatriots. – Rappler.com "

The first and second cookies were in the oven for 25 minutes and 75 minutes but were still under-baked. The best results came from 120 and 130 minutes in the oven. ""We made space cookies and milk for Santa this year,"" Koch tweeted. The prototype oven which can be used in microgravity was designed and built by Nanoracks and Zero G Kitchen while the Double Tree by Hilton hotel chain supplied the raw cookie dough. ""The ISS smelled like fresh chocolate chip cookies when @astro_luca opened the oven door! Just like home!"" Nanoracks tweeted.

At 38, Roger Federer continues to prove he has plenty of gas left in the tank. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Roger Federer lives to win titles, but five-set thrillers like his epic against John Millman at the Australian Open are also a key reason why he is still playing aged 38. The Swiss master looked out for the count at 4-8 down in a nailbiting fifth-set super tiebreaker against the gutsy Australian, but somehow found a way back to clinch the third-round clash, 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (10/8). Federer admitted it was ""extremely difficult"" and he went through the full gamut of emotions. But that is how he likes it. He said the electric atmosphere on Rod Laver Arena and the thrill of a match that stretched for more than 4 hours was part of why he continues to play. ""Yeah, no doubt,"" said the 20-time Grand Slam winner. ""I mean, in the moment itself, it's very gruelling and, at times, very disappointing when you are in situations where you get broken in the 5th or you're down in the super breaker and lose the 1st set. ""That's when you really start wondering, why couldn't I close this match earlier and all these things?"" ""Then all of a sudden you turn the whole thing around within, like, two minutes and it was so worthwhile – everything that I have gone through."" After 22 years of Grand Slam tennis, he said his motivation remained strong ""because of winning titles, trying to win as many matches as possible, enjoy myself out on court."" ""But also being in epic matches like this,"" he added. ""It doesn't always have to be finals. As long as the crowds are into it, you have a great battle with an opponent who you really admire and respect, it's a good feeling."" ""I'm happy I had that match. I hope I would feel the same way also if I would have lost, to be honest."" Federer had played 53 five-setters in his storied career before meeting Millman, winning 30 and losing 23, but few could match the intensity of the battle on Friday evening. Millman is one of the fittest players on tour and memorably beat Federer over 4 tight sets in the round of 16 at the US Open in 2018. ""That's why I mumbled something to him at the net just saying, 'I have so much respect for you, and it's such a pity, I'm so sorry, but well played,'"" said the Swiss star.

452,250167,"January 25, 2020",US & Canada,Democratic prosecutors wrap up case against Trump,Agence France-Presse,"Democrats continue to hope for subpoenas on 4 potential witnesses, while Trump's victory is virtually assured in a Republican-led US Senate  IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS. US President Donald Trump speaks to the press outside the grand ballroom as he arrives for a New Year's celebration at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 31, 2019. Photo by Jim Watson/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – Democratic prosecutors on Friday, January 24, wrapped up 3 days of arguments for seeking Donald Trump's removal from office, as the US president's lawyers prepared to take their turn presenting his defense in the Senate's historic impeachment trial. For a final 8-hour stretch, the 100 senators listened as Democrats argued that Trump abused the power of the presidency in pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations that would help him politically and then sought to block efforts by Congress to investigate. Democrats said they had met the burden of proof as they warned Republicans that Trump would remain a grave danger to the nation if left in office. ""This is Trump first, not America first, not American ideals first,"" Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, told the chamber. ""I ask you, I implore you,"" he added, addressing Republicans who hold the power to allow witnesses to testify next week, against Trump's wishes. ""Give America a fair trial,"" Schiff said. ""She's worth it."" Trump's team of lawyers take the floor to offer his defense beginning at 10 am (1500 GMT) Saturday, a timeslot which Trump, a former reality TV star, referred to in a tweet as ""Death Valley in T.V."" His side's arguments will continue Monday and Tuesday, before the chamber turns to questioning and then votes on whether to hear from witnesses, something Democrats have sought from the start. ""It's going to be much more concise, it's going to be easier to understand, and not swamped with the same information over and over again,"" Republican Senator Mike Braun told Fox News of Trump's upcoming defense. Democrats argued on the floor that Trump's refusal to allow top officials to testify and to supply subpoenaed documents to the Ukraine investigation supported the second charge against him, obstruction of Congress. Trump blocked the executive branch from responding to 71 specific requests for documents, including 5 subpoenas, related to his pressure on Kiev to help his 2020 reelection effort, Democratic impeachment manager Val Deming told senators. Trump also prevented 12 current and former administration officials, most of them subpoenaed, from testifying to the investigation, she said. ""President Trump's obstruction of the impeachment inquiry was categorical, indiscriminate and historically unprecedented,"" Demings said. She said Congress could not afford to allow Trump to reject its powers in such a wholesale manner. ""Executive power without any sort of restraint, without oversight, and without any checks and balances, is absolute power,"" she told the Senate hearing. ""And we know what has been said about absolute power. Absolute power corrupts, absolutely."" 'Truth matters' Schiff had argued a day earlier that Trump's Ukraine scheme demonstrated the president was a threat to national security, and that ""if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed."" ""Because right matters,"" Schiff said. ""And truth matters. Otherwise we are lost."" On Twitter, Trump dismissed the entire process. ""The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have gone crazy,"" he tweeted, ramping up his rhetoric. ""They know it's a con, but just can't sell it! Public strongly against Impeachment."" Fight over subpoenas Closure of the Democrats' opening arguments paves the way for Trump's team to urge acquittal in only the third ever impeachment trial of a US president. Trump's clearance is virtually assured: Senate Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, and a vote by 67 senators, a two-thirds supermajority, is required for conviction and removal. Democrats were hoping however to woo some Republicans to embrace their arguments that the Senate should subpoena 4 of the witnesses Demings referred to, current and former White House officials with direct knowledge of Trump's Ukraine machinations. There were hints that at least two or three Republicans were considering supporting the subpoenas, though none had committed. But without 4 crossovers, analysts were predicting that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a key Trump defender, would be able to bring the trial to a vote on the charges by late next week, and see Trump soon exculpated on a party-line vote. 'They hate Trump' If Democrats do gain support for subpoenas, Republican leaders threatened to demand their own witnesses and call Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter to testify, because their connections to Ukraine had been at the heart of Trump's scheme to tarnish his election rivals. Trump and McConnell also suggested the president would claim executive privilege to reject the subpoenas, which would lead to multiple court challenges and ensure that the trial could go on for weeks more. Neither party relishes that thought as the battle ahead of November elections intensifies. The prosecution showed senators scores of videos, internal documents and extensive witness testimony to lay out their case that Trump abused his powers. Before a national television audience, the prosecution detailed how Trump flagrantly undertook last year to force Kiev to help him tarnish Biden. Trump defense lawyer Jay Sekulow said they would open their reply by putting on an ""affirmative case"" that would ""rebut and refute"" the Democrats' arguments. Republican Senator Jim Inhofe dismissed all the testimony so far as ""hearsay."" ""These are not impeachable offenses,"" he said. ""They just want to get rid of this guy. They hate Trump."" – Rappler.com "

From all over the world, they look to us,” the lawmaker from California said at Trump's impeachment trial, referencing the bloody war on drugs in the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte.

The virus has struck at a bad time for containment, with hundreds of millions of Chinese rushing home for the festival. The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down anyway during the week-long break. The outbreak emerged in late December and has been traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat.

""Possible effects on the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) and EDCA (Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement) may have to be studied separately by the Departnment of National Defense and Department of Foreign Affairs, but the DOJ will be ready to assist,"" Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told reporters in a message on Saturday, January 25. Guevarra will submit on Monday, January 27, to President Rodrigo Duterte the DOJ's legal memorandum on the proper procedures to terminate the VFA. From his end, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said he would ""start the process"" of terminating the VFA. That is only 4 days after Duterte announced to terminate the VFA as an outburst against the US' cancelation of visa of former police chief and now Senator Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa. The visa cancelation is widely seen as an effect of the Global Magnitsky Act that imposes sanctions on human rights violators. The VFA The VFA was ratified by the Senate in 1999 as a reaffirmation of the obligations of the Philippines and US under the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). The MDT is a commitment of the Philippines and the US  ""to respond to any external armed attack on their territory, armed forces, public vessels, and aircraft,"" according to the Supreme Court decision Bayan vs Zamora. As an offshoot of the MDT, the VFA provided that ""from time to time elements of the United States armed forces may visit the Republic of the Philippines"" for capacity building among others. Under former president Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino III, the Philippine government passed the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) which provided for increased US military presence in the Philippines. EDCA was an ""adjustment in detail"" in the implementation of both the MDT and the VFA, quoting from the government's previous court pleadings. EDCA was passed without the concurrence of the Senate, prompting groups to file a petition before the Supreme Court to challenge its constitutionality. In 2016, the Supreme Court voted 10-4-1 to declare EDCA constitutional as it held that it was an executive agreement that does not need the Senate's concurrence. Guevarra's memo will venture into these legalities. ""We shall answer such questions as: is the VFA a treaty or an executive agreement? if it’s a treaty, is senate concurrence required for termination?"" Guevarra said. ""Who will give the notice of termination? Is it necessary to state any ground for termination?"" Guevarra added. Guevarra said the memorandum will ""deal with the procedure for termination only, not the wisdom of the executive action."" ""Wisdom refers to the pros and cons of the termination. That's political, not legal. The DOJ will deal only on the legal way to terminate the VFA,"" said Guevarra. Past SC decisions Progressive groups have filed petitions to junk the VFA before on grounds that it violates Philippine sovereignty. But the Supreme Court in 2000, through Bayan vs Zamora, upheld the VFA saying that there was no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the president and the Senate. ""In fine, absent any clear showing of grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondents, this Court- as the final arbiter of legal controversies and staunch sentinel of the rights of the people - is then without power to conduct an incursion and meddle with such affairs purely executive and legislative in character and nature,"" said the Supreme Court in that case. In upholding the constitutionality of EDCA, the Supreme Court recognized the ""fears"" of the return of US bases out of  ""desire for self-determination, nationalism, and above all a commitment to ensure the independence of the Philippine Republic from any foreign domination."" ""Mere fears, however, cannot curtail the exercise by the President of the Philippines of his Constitutional prerogatives in respect of foreign affairs. They cannot cripple him when he deems that additional security measures are made necessary by the times,"" said the SC in the January 2016 decision in Saguisag vs Executive Secretary. – Rappler.com  "

Taal Volcano appears calm on January 21, 2020, but records of volcanic activity show otherwise. Photo by Franz Lopez/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Nearly two weeks since Alert Level 4 was raised for Taal Volcano in Batangas, the period of unrest continues. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in its 8 am bulletin on Saturday, January 25, that ""weak to moderate emission of white steam-laden plumes"" persisted from the main crater in the past 24 hours. The plumes were 100 to 800 meters high, compared to 50 to 500 meters high stated in the previous bulletin on Friday, January 24. Taal also continues to emit sulfur dioxide (SO2), a major gas component of magma. This indicates that magma is already at a shallow level of the volcano or is moving toward the surface. SO2 emission was measured at an average of 409 tons per day, higher versus the previous figure of 224 tons per day. (READ: Taal Volcano's 2020 eruption: What we know so far) More volcanic earthquakes were recorded too, using the Philippine Seismic Network, which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former. The Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 744 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12, when the unrest began. Of these, 176 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. From 5 am on Friday until 5 am on Saturday, there were 6 volcanic earthquakes plotted at magnitudes 1.5 to 2.3, with no felt event. Meanwhile, the Taal Volcano Network recorded 420 volcanic earthquakes, including 11 low-frequency earthquakes, just in the past 24 hours. According to the United States Geological Survey, low-frequency earthquakes ""are caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface."" ""Seismic activity likely signifies magmatic intrusion beneath the Taal edifice that may lead to eruptive activity,"" Phivolcs said. Alert Level 4 means a hazardous eruption is ""imminent"" or may occur ""within hours to days."" ([PODCAST] Taal Volcano 2020 eruption: Ano ang worst-case scenario?) Phivolcs reiterated that there must be ""total evacuation"" of Taal Volcano Island as well as high-risk areas within a 14-kilometer radius from the main crater. The agency earlier expressed alarm after a video went viral, showing a man ""touring"" viewers along a trail leading to Taal's main crater. The lockdown of towns near the volcano, which authorities maintain is necessary for safety, has been met with resistance by some residents worried about their homes, pets, and livestock left behind.

George, the last known member of the Pinta tortoise species, died in 2012 at over 100 years of age after refusing to mate in captivity with females from related subspecies.

In 2008, a similar expedition took blood samples from 1,726 tortoises, 17 of which had a ""significant percentage"" of genes in common with the Pinta species while about 80 showed a ""partial lineage"" to the Floreana species, PNG said.

Rafael Nadal says his drubbing of Pablo Carreno Busta is his ""best match"" of the Australian Open so far. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Top seed Rafael Nadal routed fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta for the loss of just 7 games Saturday, January 25, as the world No. 1 revved up his bid for a 20th Grand Slam title. The 33-year-old Nadal was in virtuoso form to charge past the 27th seed, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, in hot sunshine at the Rod Laver Arena and make the round of 16 at Melbourne Park for a 13th time. ""My best match of the tournament so far, without a doubt,"" said Nadal. ""I'm improving every day, so super happy."" ""I did well on my serve and hit good forehands down the line, which is a key shot for me."" Nadal joined defending champion Novak Djokovic and great rival Roger Federer in the fourth round with a potential showdown next with Nick Kyrgios. The Australian, who disparagingly labelled Nadal ""super salty"" last year, and mimicked his serving routine during his second-round clash, meets Russian Karen Khachanov later. Nadal, a finalist last year when he crashed to Novak Djokovic in straight sets, was far from clinical in his previous match against Federico Delbonis, winning only 3 out of 20 break points. But his conversion rate against his Davis Cup teammate was much better, putting away 5 from 10 in a dominant display from the 2009 champion. He broke Carreno Busta on his first service game to immediately take charge, dictating the rallies and forcing his opponent around the court. Carreno Busta became a spectator as Nadal raced through the set in 29 minutes and he then broke again early in the following set to inflict more pain. Nadal's relentless consistency was too much for the 28-year-old, who had no answers to the constant pressure and pinpoint service returns that were a trademark in the easy win. If Nadal clinches a second title in Melbourne, he will equal the 20 Grand Slam crowns held by Federer.

As in the past years, Duterte highlighted the “friendship” between the Philippines and China in his Lunar New Year message on Saturday, January 25. “As we open a new page in our shared history, may we foster even stronger bonds of friendship with those of Chinese descent all around the world through cooperation, investments, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people ties,” Duterte said. “I also hope that the Chinese-Filipino community will continue to engage in socio-civic and charitable acts that will uplift the lives of our people, especially the poor and the marginalized,” he added. According to Duterte, these “small acts of kindness” would “create a ripple effect” that would benefit the whole country. The President’s message comes just a day after he said he would leave it up to time and economic cooperation when dealing with China’s militarization of the West Philippine Sea, a part of the South China Sea that belongs to the Philippines but China claims for itself. A Hague tribunal affirmed the Philippines’ ownership of the West Philippine Sea in 2016. But Duterte has downplayed this arbitral victory in order to get loans and grants from China.

Karapatan noted the assault came just 10 days after the Region 11 Regional Peace and Order Council issued a resolution demanding the total closure of the UCCP Haran’s compound. “The National Task Force to End the Local Communist Armed Conflict, and its local counterpart in the Southern Mindanao region are undoubtedly behind this latest attack.

More than half of evacuees chose to live outside of evacuation centers. Photo by Charles Salazar/Rappler BATANGAS, Philippines – A village in Santo Tomas, Batangas is not operating an evacuation center, but there are over 500 evacuees seeking shelter there for two weeks now. Cherryl Lazara, 37, evacuated from her home in Talisay on January 12, following the Taal Volcano eruption. She sought refuge from the wrath of Taal, and headed straight to her relatives living at Barangay San Luis in Santo Tomas, roughly 26 kilometers away. On that evening, Lazara said that at least 8 other families took shelter at their relative's home. Now, 3 families have moved out of their temporary home. ""Hinihiling po talaga namin na mabigyan ng mga panibagong pagsisimulan ’yung lahat ng mga bakwit, lalo na ’yung wala sa mga evacuation center,"" Lazara told Rappler. (We’re hoping that all the evacuees will be given help to start anew, especially those who are not staying in evacuation centers.) Lazara said she was thankful of Barangay San Luis officials, who accommodated evacuees even if they don't reside in the village. ""'Yung presence nung mga namumuno samin, hindi man namin nararamdaman pero ’yung barangay dito talagang…. hindi mo maintindihan na kahit hindi kami tiga-rito, tinanggap nila kami ng buong-buo,"" Lazara said. (In our own village, we didn’t feel the presence of our officials [in Talisay], but this barangay – I couldn't understand, that even if we’re not from here, they still accepted us.)  IN-HOUSE EVACUEE. Cherryl Lazara is an evacuee from Barangay Aya in Talisay, Batangas. Photo by Charles Salazar/Rappler Plan for in-house evacuees needed Lazara's family is just among the 38,102 families who opted to stay out of crowded evacuation centers following the Taal Volcano eruption. In San Luis, there are 154 families, or 566 persons, who either have relatives in the village or simply went there because the evacuation centers were just too full to accommodate them. San Luis barangay councilor Dominador Celis Jr said that they are willing to help the evacuees as long as they can, but acknowledged that they may not be able to do so in the long run. ""Kasi hindi po natin alam hangga’t kelan ang pagbabantay sa Taal Volcano. Siguro po ay dahil marami nang nakatulong, mahihirapan na po kami sa mga susunod na araw,"" Celis said. (We don’t know how long we’ll have to watch Taal Volcano. But because a lot of people have already helped us, donations might be harder to come by in the next days.) The village's internal revenue allotment, or 2020 budget, is only at P3.5 million. Under the law, at least 5% of their IRA, or P175,000, should go to disaster-related efforts. That meant 70% of the P175,000 should go to pre-disaster purchases, or P122,500, which Celis admitted is not even enough to buy equipment for their village. The remaining P52,500 is for the quick response fund, which they could not access because San Luis is not under a state of calamity. The barangay simply does not have enough funds to provide aid to the evacuees in the long run. ""Sa [Santo Tomas City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office] wala pa po kaming natatanggap. Ang mga pinamimigay namin from Day 1, galing po sa mga private group at individuals,"" said Celis, (We haven’t received help from Santo Tomas CDRRMO. From Day 1, the relief goods we’re giving to evacuees have come from private groups and individuals.) Celis added that the local government, where the evacuees are from, had not provided aid for their residents in San Luis yet. ""Kaya po naman kami nananawagan sa gobyerno na sana naman po ay makasama ’yung mga in-house evacuees [sa programa],"" Celis said. (That's why we’re asking the government to have a program for in-house evacuees.) Taal Volcano is still on Alert Level 4, as state volcanologists said that a major explosion can still happen within ""hours, days, or weeks."" (READ: Calabarzon residents have no management plan for volcanic eruptions – survey) With at least 11 towns surrounding Taal Volcano on total lockdown and the threat of a hazardous eruption is still imminent, evacuees are not certain when they can go back to their homes.

The Harvard Humanitarian Initiative Program on Resilient Communities (HHI PRC) is partnering with the University of Santo Tomas (UST) and the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP) to award outstanding media contents on disaster resilience produced by students in the Philippines. “Truly, no aspect of life is left untouched by the challenge that climate change poses and we all take a fundamental responsibility to act in countering the long-term damage we have done. This will require new thinking, new ideas, and a willingness to act with a sense of urgency and purpose. Invariably, it is today's youth that will bear the brunt of the challenge and will be asked to provide new solutions. This video and radio competition is an example of one of the steps being taken to rise to meet the collective challenges we face,” HHI PRC program director Vincenzo Bollettino said. The competition, called “PMAC Student Awards,” welcomes entries in the form of short video documentary, public service announcement (PSA), and radio jockeying (male/female), with “Filipinos’ resilience to hazards” as the theme. It is open and free to all college students taking communication, journalism or media-related courses in the country. “This year's theme is very important because it places in perspective the power media has to contribute to people's preparedness and resilience. With media's development so shall its role develop, too. Responsible reportage of disasters should come hand in hand with raising awareness on preparedness and resilience to lessen the people's vulnerability to calamities,” PMAC project adviser and UST Assistant Professor Anna Cielo Timbol-Perez said. The winners for each category will receive P10,000 (1st place), P5,000 (2nd place), P3,000 (3rd place), and P3,000 (fan favorite award). Aside from the cash prize, the winning entries will each receive a plaque and certificate, as well as get a chance to be showcased online and at HHI PRC events to reach a wider audience. The deadline for the online submission of entries is on February 28, 2020. It will be judged by veteran broadcast journalists in the country, duly selected by the KBP, UST and HHI PRC. Advocacy journalism The PMAC Student Awards coincides with the Philippine Media Advocacy Convention (PMAC) 2020 happening on March 18-19, 2020 at UST in España, Manila, where reputable journalists will hold talks and workshops on disaster preparedness reporting, peace building reporting, and environmental protection reporting. Formerly called ‘Podcon,’ the convention has been known for promoting advocacy journalism in radio broadcasting and podcasting since 2012. It has previously tackled reporting on human rights, voter education, youth empowerment, and fake news, among others, which made it a two-time recipient of the prestigious Philippine Quill Awards. This 2020, the project has rebranded to include other types of media in its agenda. It focuses on “The Media and its Impact on Public Safety and Security” as its main theme this year. “We are thankful for the HHI PRC for helping us realize the expansion of the project’s scope to include all types of media to make this convention more relevant to the changing times. The Podcon that has annually undertaken issues relevant to radio is now reborn as the broader PMAC,” Perez explained. Registration to the two-day convention costs only P150 ($3) each. Proceeds will be funded for emergency kits or ""go bags"" for the residents of Gigantes Islands in Iloilo province, a coastal community severely impacted by disasters and climate change. Previously, the convention has donated a total of more or less a thousand children’s books to different public school libraries in Metro Manila.

""Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,"" chief executive Carrie Lam told reporters. Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning, January 25, after returning from Davos as criticism of her administration's response had risen in some quarters. Of the five people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, four arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland. That has led to calls from some to limit, or even halt, arrivals from the Chinese mainland, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak with 41 people dead so far. At a press conference on Saturday, Lam said all flights and trains from Wuhan would be cancelled until further notice. There were no restrictions on transport from other Chinese cities, but all mainland arrivals will now need to sign a health declaration form.

Photo by Michelle Abad/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Laguna Representative Sol Aragones, who refiled the prevention of teen pregnancies bill in the House after it languished in the 17th Congress, believes that the bill will meet the President’s pen this time around. Aragones sounds more upbeat despite the cold reception when she filed it with the 17th Congress. In the Senate, its counterpart was filed by Senator Risa Hontiveros. The Senate version was approved on the third reading while the House version only reached the committee level. There are at least 3 versions in the House and two in the Senate in the current Congress. “I’m optimistic it will be passed this Congress because more lawmakers in both Houses are convinced and being convinced with the merits of the bill,” Aragones told Rappler. However, Carolyn Sobritchea, head for the technical panel for women’s and gender studies at the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), is not so optimistic, speaking from years of experience as a resource person for Congress. Ever since the 13th Congress, early versions of the bill have always been refiled. Meanwhile, the number of young girls getting pregnant continues to increase at an alarming rate. The Commission on Population and Development (PopCom) reported that over a 10-year period about 1.2 million children had children. In 2017, the National Demographic and Health Survey reported that one out of 10 women aged 15-19 have begun bearing children. The Philippines also had the second highest adolescent fertility rate in Southeast Asia in 2018, with 60.5 births per 1,000 women. PopCom has called on President Rodrigo Duterte to declare adolescent pregnancy a national emergency, as incidence rates remain stagerring. Bill still ‘raw’ Sobritchea has often been invited to serve as resource person following her decades specializing in women’s studies. While Sobritchea said the the Senate bill is generally ""very exhaustive"" in its present state, there are still certain provisions that remain ""hilaw"" (raw). She said the inter-agency Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Council was formed well, with agencies designated for both prevention and action for teenage mothers. Education was at the forefront of preventive efforts while the Department of Health (DOH) would deal with the immediate health concerns of the mothers. However, she described the provisions on what schools could do for teen mothers as “hilaw"" (raw) or much could still be expected from it. “I’m a veteran in seeing laws pass concerning women… Although we have affirmed the importance of the matter due to the statistics and alarming rates, I don’t think the bill will pass this Congress,” said Sobritchea. Sobritchea said the biggest challenge that the bill in its current state was with the level of expected efforts from the local government units, without further going into much detail. Fast facts on current bill If passed into law, the implementation of Senate Bill 161, or the Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy Act will be led by an inter-agency Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Council, to be composed of the following: The council will be in charge of implementing measures concerning the different needs of adolescents, from the prevention level to the social protection of teenage parents.

Nick Kyrgios will face his toughest challenge in the Australian Open against top seed Rafael Nadal. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Firebrand Nick Kyrgios scraped past Karen Khachanov Saturday in 5 thrilling sets to set up a grudge match against top seed Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open fourth round. The Australian showman came through a tense battle with the Russian 16th seed after 4 hours and 26 minutes in front of passionate home support on Melbourne Arena to win 6-2, 7-6 (7/5), 6-7 (6/8), 6-7 (7/9), 7-6 (10/8). ""Mate, it was crazy, I don't even know what to say right now, it was insane, I have no words for how I'm feeling right now,"" said Kyrgios. ""This is epic, man, I don’t even know what's going on,"" he added. ""He's (Khachanov) [was] an absolute warrior."" It sets up a mouthwatering clash with the world No. 1 Nadal, who romped past fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. Kyrgios, who was handed a 16-week suspended ban in September after a string of indiscretions, disparagingly labelled Nadal ""super salty"" last year, and mimicked his serving routine during the second round at Melbourne Park. But Kyrgios tried to play down the feud with Nadal on Saturday, saying: ""He has a winning record against me. Whatever happens between us, he's an amazing player, he's arguably the greatest of all time."" Asked about 23rd seed Kyrgios after his match, Nadal was also diplomatic. ""When he plays good tennis and he shows passion for this game, he is a positive player for our tour."" ""When he's doing the other stuff, of course I don't like."" Kyrgios admitted he was on the verge of going ""to a very dark place"" in his second-round clash against Gilles Simon before refocusing. And he mostly held it together against Khachanov, before a blow up at the umpire in set 4 over a time violation. He had a match-point chance in each of the 3rd and 4th sets but the Russian held firm to ensure Kyrgios played the longest match of his career. The Kyrgios serve was on fire early on, sending down 4 aces in the first two sets. He made the break in game six, with Khachanov firing wide after a deft drop shot from the Australian. But Kyrgios was grimacing, and at 5-2, took a medical timeout for an upper left leg niggle. He returned to break again and empathically take the set. The 2nd set went with serve up to a tiebreaker, with some electrifying tennis from both men. Kyrgios won it and Khachanov slammed his racket in frustration. Kyrgios worked 3 break points in game 5 of the 3rd set and while Khachanov managed to save two, he sent down a double fault to hand Kyrgios a crucial 3-2 advantage. But he lost focus and was quickly broken and it went to another tiebreaker. Kyrgios saved two break points at 3-3 in the 4th set then lost control after being given a time violation, hurling his racket and confronting the umpire, calling him ""stupid."" His rant continued as he received attention for a nasty cut on his knuckle at the changeover after a spectacular airborne half-volley. That set also went to a tiebreak where Khachanov prevailed, sending it to a 5th set. There was nothing between them as they slammed balls at each other until the Australian finally won in the super tiebreaker, falling to the ground exhausted. – Rappler.com "

Brexit will not affect cooperation between intelligence services in Europe, says a EU official. Photo by Tolga Akmen/AFP ZAGREB, Croatia – Brexit will not negatively affect cooperation between the intelligence services in Europe, the EU's anti-terrorism coordinator said. ""The exchange of information is not impacted,"" Gilles de Kerchove said on the sidelines of a meeting of EU interior ministers in Zagreb on Friday, January 24. Cooperation between the intelligence services is already ""outside the institutional framework of the"" EU, and non-members Norway and Switzerland are already part of it, he told Agence France-Presse. Britain will also be represented within this framework after it leaves the European Union on January 31. He said that the issue is more whether if, and in what form, London will continue to have access to EU police data. Britain shares intelligence through the Schengen Information System (SIS) for law enforcement purposes, although it is not part of the passport-free Schengen zone. In recent years, the SIS information base has become an important tool for tracking jihadists entering Europe from Syria and Iraq. De Kerchove was not able to say how the EU could continue to cooperate with Britain in regard to the SIS. But ""it is impossible for a non-EU member to have the (same) degree of intimacy as that of an EU member."" The question should be resolved in talks between London and Brussels on their future relationship, expected to begin in February. De Kerchove said the EU has worked in close cooperation with the US on law enforcement matters and ""it would be absurd that our geographically close neighbor finds itself in an inferior situation to that of the Americans, particularly in the fight against terrorism."" The Belgian EU official also expressed concern over the situation in Iraq and Syria. He said recent developments on the ground could lead the Islamic State group to ""rebuild"" after the defeat of its caliphate. A pullout of US troops ""would certainly weaken the capacity of the Iraqi army to fight what remains of"" the ISIS. He also said the fate of some 5,500 ISIS fighters has not been sufficiently clarified. ""A good number"" of them have already returned home, around 600 are in prisons in the region and at least one quarter are dead. But the number of dead is probably higher as many jihadists have been killed in battles for the caliphate but authorities have not received confirmation. – Rappler.com "

Tauseef Mustafa/AFP SRINAGAR, India – Indian authorities on Saturday, January 25, restored internet in Indian Kashmir after a five-and-a-half-month blackout but maintained a block on social media sites. (READ: Restive Kashmir marks 100 days since India stripped autonomy) Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government imposed a communications blackout in early August when it stripped the portion of Kashmir it controls – the country's only Muslim-majority region – of its partial autonomy. India also imposed a curfew, sent in tens of thousands of extra troops, and detained dozens of Kashmiri political leaders and others, many of whom remain in detention, drawing criticism abroad. Internet access was restored Saturday but only to 301 government-approved websites that include international news publications and platforms such as Netflix and Amazon. Mobile phone data access was also restored, although it was limited to slower second-generation (2G) connections. ""It's good some internet access has been restored but it's so slow I'm hardly able to access anything and social media is also off-limits,"" Raashid Ahmad, a university student, told Agence France-Presse. Azhar Hussain, a local businessman, also complained about the internet speed being ""painfully slow."" India is the world leader in cutting internet services, activists say, and access was also temporarily suspended in other parts of the country during recent protests against a new citizenship law. Since August freedom of movement in heavily-militarized Kashmir has been gradually restored as has cellphone coverage, but apart from at a handful of locations, there has been no regular internet access. This made life even harder for the region's 7 million inhabitants and hit the local economy hard. Modi's government said that the blackout was for security reasons, aimed at restricting the ability of armed militants – who it says are backed by arch-rival Pakistan – to communicate. However, the Supreme Court criticized the government earlier this month for the move, calling it an ""arbitrary exercise of power."" The court also stated that having access to the internet ""is integral to an individual's right to freedom of speech and expression."" Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since independence in 1947, and has been the spark of two wars and numerous flare-ups between the two nuclear-armed foes.

490,250206,"January 28, 2020",Food,One 'Matinong Boyfriend' please: Sebastian's Ice Cream offers 4 V-Day flavors,Steph Arnaldo,"Care for a 'Matinong Girlfriend?' Or would you rather have a scoop of 'Unresolved Issues' or 'Closure?'   MANILA, Philippines – Love is in the air as D-Day – we mean, V-Day – approaches. And although you might be flying solo this year, Sebastian's Ice Cream is here to make the occasion a bit more bearable for the single sweet tooths out there. ""One Matinong Boyfriend, please."" ""Pahingi po ng Closure, ate."" ""Isa pang Unresolved Issues, please."" ""Sa wakas, nakahanap na ako ng Matinong Girlfriend."" No, these aren't hugot lines from Twitter – these are the names of Sebastian's 4 cheekily creative ice cream flavors, available at all Metro Manila branches exclusively during the sawi season. What's your flava? Starting Saturday, February 1, local artisanal ice cream shop Sebastian's is offering the Matinong Girlfriend (P145/scoop), made out of dark beer – Cerveza Negra to be exact. Honey-roasted nuts dipped in bittersweet chocolate are also mixed into the ice cream.  Photo courtesy of Sebastian's ""The Matinong Girlfriend line is aimed for boys, so the flavor is more 'bro type,' very 'epic meal time.' Before, I've done it with cheetos, potato chips, and chicharon. So this year, I did it with beer,"" Sebastian's owner Ian Carandang told Rappler. Don't fear the beer – it actually tastes like a sweet toffee caramel with a dark chocolate crunch, thanks to the whole peanuts mixed in. When beer is cooked down, the alcohol evaporates but the natural sugars of the malt come out, which gives it its burnt sugar charm. On the other hand, the Matinong Boyfriend (P145/scoop) is here for those into dark, sweet, and zesty. It's dark chocolate ice cream mixed with rhum, real orange zest and spiced, candied hazelnuts.  Photo courtesy of Sebastian's ""This line has more finesse, and always has fruit in it. I take more care in it, because I want it to exude feminine energy. This year, it's orange zest. I've used berries and cream and passion fruit before,"" Ian said. For fans of a rich dark cocoa, this won't disapoint, especially if you're into a bit of nutty crunch in your ice cream as well. The orange zest leaves a refreshing, citrus touch, which helps cut through the richness of the dark chocolate. And if it's Closure (P135/scoop) you're looking for – maybe an ice cream version would help? This flavor is made of genmaicha tea, Japanese green tea with roasted popped rice – a mildly sweet, slightly fragrant choice.  Photo courtesy of Sebastian's ""For 'Closure,' the theme is wellness, so it's always been tea-based. I’ve done chai and chrysanthemum. It always goes down smoothly, so it's very gentle and soothing,"" Ian said. But, hold up! There are still Unresolved Issues (P90/scoop) to deal with – if you dare. This flavor is literally para sa mga bitter, because surprise – it's made with ampalaya.  Photo courtesy of Sebastian's A creamy buko-like sorbet with bits of candied ampalaya mixed in – this isn't for the faint of heart – and neither are unresolved issues. ""I got the idea from my mom who's diabetic. Every night after dinner she has ampalaya tea – it's this green, strong ampalaya water, which I turned into a sorbet,"" Ian said. Unresolved Issues' bittergourd flavor has been around since 2015, and has been the same since. According to Ian, he chose it to never change, to never move forward, and to always stay the same – just like a bitter ex. ""I wanted to make it not just as a joke, but to be appreciated too, so there's a sweetness. But I still wanted it to taste like ampalaya!"" Its origins ""Most of my Valentine’s days I’ve been single. The occasion is aimed for couples, but it can be a bit rough if you're single, so I wanted to reprogram it,"" said Ian. ""It was in 2015 when I first started this,"" Ian said, sharing that it was actually his friend who ""predicted"" that he'd name his newest ice cream flavor ""Matinong Boyfriend."" ""Since then, my motto would be: If you were single, come to the shop and find your 'Matinong Boyfriend' or girlfriend here! And then it turned out to be a hit,"" he added. The next year, he kept the two names, but switched up the recipes. He also added two new flavors: Unresolved Issues and Closure, and the rest was hugot history. – Rappler.com "

With Ressa are New Yorker columnist Masha Gessen and Patrick Gaspard, Open Society Foundation president. Photo by Pia Ranada/Rappler. PARK CITY, United States –  How do we fix an online public space that has exploded with incidents of harassment, hate, and calls for violence? A panel of journalists and a civic engagement veteran find the solution in regulation at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival’s Truth to Power discussion, which sought to discuss the role of a free press and organizers under an authoritarian regime. Rappler chief executive officer and executive editor Maria Ressa said that social media giants like Facebook and Twitter should be regulated by the government, particularly restricting them from data of its millions of users. “One solution is to actually legislate that we own our data. If there was data portability from these platforms, they have far more incentive to keep us safe,” Ressa said during the panel discussion on Saturday, January 25. Under Ressa’s leadership, Rappler has extensively documented how user-generated algorithms used by Facebook has been exploited by supporters of the Duterte administration to push forward usually false narratives in the interest of the President and his allies. Ressa and Rappler are subjects in Filipino-American documentary filmmaker Ramona Diaz's ""A Thousand Cuts"", which premiers at Sundance under the US Documentary Competition. Agreeing on the same point was New Yorker columnist Masha Gessen, who has been following developments on Russia. In her view, the big tech companies’ interest of making money out of the public sphere stood “at odds” with promoting online space that is safe for all. “We have to face the fundamental problem that we have entrusted our public sphere to profit-making corporations,” Gessen said. Patrick Gaspard, president of the Open Sources Foundation, said that this can be done locally, the same as how San Francisco banned facial recognition technology. “It’s been easier to crowdsource bullying, crowdsource violence, and crowdsource hatred…We don’t allow that kind of violence in the physical public square so why would we allow it in the virtual public square?” Gaspard said. In the end, Ressa noted that legislation is only one of the many ways to counter the culture of hate that has sprung online in recent years. “Has to be multilateral. The tech platforms  are saying we don't know what to do or we're doing our best, but it's not enough,” Ressa said. – Rappler.com "

Taal Volcano as seen from Balete, Batangas, on January 26, 2020. Photo by Charles Salazar/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Taal Volcano in the province of Batangas was downgraded from Alert Level 4 to Alert Level 3 on Sunday morning, January 26, two weeks into its restive period. Alert Level 3 means there is now a ""decreased tendency towards hazardous eruption."" But the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) cautioned that it ""should not be interpreted that unrest has ceased or that the threat of a hazardous eruption has disappeared."" What happens under Alert Level 3? With Taal at Alert Level 3, these could still occur: Taal Volcano Island and lakeshore areas may be threatened. What should the public do? Phivolcs is still recommending that entry into Taal Volcano Island, classified as a Permanent Danger Zone, be prohibited. Areas within a 7-kilometer radius from the main crater should also be off-limits. This is down from the 14-kilometer radius implemented during Alert Level 4. (READ: LIST: Batangas towns, cities where lockdowns are lifted as Taal down to Alert Level 3) ""Local government units are advised to assess areas outside the 7-kilometer radius for damage and road accessibilities and to strengthen preparedness, contingency, and communication measures in case of renewed unrest,"" Phivolcs said. ""People are also advised to observe precautions due to ground displacement across fissures, frequent ashfall, and minor earthquakes. Communities beside active river channels particularly where ash from the main eruption phase has been thickly deposited should increase vigilance when there is heavy and prolonged rainfall since the ash can be washed away and form lahars along the channels,"" it added. ""Civil aviation authorities must advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from sudden explosions and wind-remobilized ash may pose hazards to aircraft."" What were the reasons for the downgrade? Less frequent volcanic earthquake activity: ""Significant earthquakes recorded by the Philippine Seismic Network across the Taal region declined from 959 to 27 events per day and peak magnitudes of 4.1 to 2.1"" between January 12 and 24. ""The Taal Volcano Network likewise recorded a downtrend in volcanic earthquakes from 944 to 420 events per day"" between January 17 and 24 ""with a corresponding decline in the daily total seismic energy released."" Slower ground deformation of the Taal Caldera and Taal Volcano Island: ""Global Positioning System data recorded ground deformation after the main eruptive phase that included sudden widening of Taal Caldera by ~1 meter, uplift of its northwestern sector by ~20 centimeters, and subsidence of the southwestern part of [the island] by ~1 meter. These patterns were followed at much smaller rates"" between January 15 and 22. Weak steam or gas emissions at the main crater: ""After the main eruptive phase, activity in the Taal main crater diminished to infrequent weak ash eruptions and longer episodes of degassing or steaming that generated steam-laden plumes <1000 meters tall."" ""Sulfur dioxide...fluctuated between a high of ~5,300 tons per day on January 13 to a low of ~140 tons per day on January 22, but has steadied at an average of 250 tons per day in the last 5 days."" What happens next to Taal? Phivolcs reiterated on Sunday that the threat is not yet over. The Taal unrest could escalate again. ""Should an uptrend or pronounced change in monitored parameters forewarn a potential hazardous explosive eruption, the alert level may be raised back to Alert Level 4,"" the agency said. ""People residing within areas at high risk to base surges who have returned after the alert level was stepped down must thus be prepared for a quick and organized evacuation at such time."" If Taal activity continues easing, then the alert level could be further lowered to Alert Level 2. Taal Volcano started erupting last January 12, a swift escalation that led to Alert Levels 2, 3, and 4 all being declared that same day. The highest is Alert Level 5, which would mean that a hazardous eruption is already in progress. – Rappler.com "
493,250209,"January 26, 2020",Movies,"'Bad Boys for Life' review: Charming, funny, mostly entertaining",Carljoe Javier,"'There are times when it feels like they made a checklist of things that would make middle-aged nostalgia-driven movie-goers laugh, and they just went through the list'  FOR LIFE. Old and new converge in the newest movie from the franchise. Photo from the movie trailer When I told people that I was watching the new Bad Boys movie, I was greeted with surprise. But in this age of reboots and revived properties, it should come as no surprise that the franchise would be resuscitated. The first two movies were cool, hit the right notes in buddy cop comedy (at least with the humor in the time they came out), and showed off the great chemistry between stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, as well as Michael Bay’s ability at directing frenetic, exciting action sequences. Bay passes the directing duties to Adil and Bilal, but it looks and feels like he directed it himself. Bad Boys for Life feels like it was imagined and shot in the 90s. And if not for the obviously bigger budget and 2019 production values, it would make you think that it’s been locked in a time capsule. Heck, if it wasn’t for Martin Lawrence looking so obviously hefty in the iconic spinning tilt shot, you wouldn’t think that seventeen years had passed since he and Will Smith were driving in sports cars, bickering with each other, and raining bullets down on drug dealers as Detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey. The characters are reflective of the film itself, as neither seem to have matured since we last saw them storming a compound in Cuba. Burnett is still portrayed as the softie pushover who always has problems with sex (this joke has not aged well) and Lowrey as the macho alpha (whose quips now might qualify as over-expressions of toxic masculinity). At some point in the pre-production, we can imagine that there was opportunity for growth, for crafting a film that has these characters confronting aging and mortality in a very mature way. But someone said: screw that! Sure, there are moments when age and getting older are mentioned, even made fun of, but it stays surface level. And that’s alright, because what this movie really wants to be is a big, bold, buddy cop action movie. The character growth and other stuff seem to just be little breathers and speed bumps so that we can catch our breaths between action sequences. And you know what? I’m okay with that. The story itself is pretty flimsy. Someone from Mike Lowrey’s past wants revenge. She and her son target Lowrey and other people who worked on the case. Lowrey and Burnett are past their prime and a new group of younger cops is tasked to work the case. But of course the Bad Boys can’t take this vendetta sitting down, so they need to, “Ride together, die together.” This new crew of specialist cops—most famous among them is Vanessa Hudgens (and the script isn’t above making a jab at High School Musical)—seems like the movie’s attempt to engage a younger audience. The group, who go by the acronym AMMO, uses technology and what passes for “modern police work” in the Bad Boys universe, to replace the good old banging down doors and roughing up informants that Lowrey and Burnett prefer. Some of the moments showing the differences in style and age are played for humor. It’s sometimes cringe-worth, and though I am loathe to use the phrase, I couldn’t help but think “Okay, boomer” to a lot of attempts at jokes. So predictably, while there’s some friction between the old school and new school, they warm up to each other to fight the bad guys. And what’s the story with the bad guys? Well, the whole narrative doesn’t even try to tell an interesting, coherent story. Instead it references Mexican Telenovelas, and in fun moments of self-awareness, calls itself out for taking telenovela-style plot twists. So sure, the story and many of the plot points don’t make sense and challenge credulity, but then, who goes to watch a Bad Boys movie looking to find tight plots and sharp writing? There are two things that make a good Bad Boys movie: 1) great action scenes and 2) comedy from Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. This movie delivers those action sequences in spades. The action is over the top, with dazzling vehicular chases and gunplay. In particular there are some hand-to-hand scenes that I would rewatch a few times just to better appreciate how they were choreographed. The addition of the AMMO team provides a chance to mix up the fight styles and make things even more exciting visually. As for comedy, the whole franchise has always banked on the chemistry between Smith and Lawrence. Revisiting the earlier movies reveals that it was their acting and delivery more than the writing of the jokes that led to laughs. It’s largely the same here. And it’s a welcome thing to be reminded of how funny Martin Lawrence can be. There are times when it feels like they made a checklist of things that would make middle-aged nostalgia-driven movie-goers laugh, and they just went through the list. To be fair, there was a lot of laughing in the screening I attended. Some of it from me, because I do fall into that target demographic. So this movie isn’t terribly smart or an update of the formula and there are more than a few cringe-worthy Tito joke moments. Yet it’s charming, and funny, and mostly entertaining. People who fall within the target demographic will love it. Action movie fans would probably enjoy it too. The spectacle of it all makes it a pretty good big screen experience, and I’m pretty sure that when this inevitably hits cable or streaming, I would watch it again. – Rappler.com   Carl makes podcasts at PumaPodcast and teaches Creative Writing at the Ateneo Fine Arts Department.

Residents of these places are now given the option to return to their homes although they are still welcome to stay in evacuation centers, said Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas in a media briefing on Sunday morning, January 26. The following are the cities and towns where lockdowns are lifted: However, the following areas remain on lockdown as they lie within the 7-kilometer radius of the volcano's main crater. This means people are still prohibited from entering these places: Taal Volcano Island is on permanent lockdown, Mandanas said. Eruption still possible Although residents of areas where the lockdown is lifted may already return, they must be constantly alert and ready to evacuate within one hour of notice, in case Taal Volcano's activity escalates again and the status is raised to Alert Level 4. Taal Volcano may still erupt, the provincial government stressed. The chance of a hazardous eruption remains, said the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) when it lowered Taal's status to Alert Level 3 on Sunday morning. Phivolcs also warned of the likely occurrence of lahar or heavy mudflow coming from areas right beside Cavite province, and in elevated areas in Agoncillo and Laurel towns in Batangas. Rain or volcanic tremors may disturb stored volcanic ash in these areas, and cause it to flow toward lowlands and waterways. Residents must take care when returning to areas heavily affected by ashfall. Unstable structures, slippery roads, fissures, and the lack of running water and electricity increase the risk of physical injuries. – Rappler.com "

Here is our quick guide to the event, which will take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles: Women poised to lead Women dominated at last year's gala and are leading the pack this year as well, with the twerking flautist Lizzo and the teenage goth-pop phenomenon Billie Eilish expected to battle for the top awards. The Academy has long come under fire for failing to recognize women and people of color. So in recent years, it expanded the nominee field from 5 to 8 in the major 4 categories: Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best New Artist.

Pop sensation Ariana Grande is also among the top nominees, while flamenco revivalist Rosalia, up for Best New Artist, could become a rare Spanish-language winner in the general categories.  Generational shift Lizzo, Eilish and Lil Nas X are the top three contenders of the night with a combined age of 69 – a figure once closer to the average age of just one veteran star that would dominate the night. The generational shift could mark a new era for the Recording Academy, which has long favored older pop and rock mainstays.

The video-sharing app TikTok propelled the young rapper to fame – his song went viral and ultimately broke the record for the longest stretch atop the Billboard hot songs chart at 19 weeks. The genre-bending mega-hit was removed from Billboard's country music charts early last year – which critics alleged was industry white-washing as the artist is black.

Mill ended his controversial legal saga in August after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor gun charge dating back more than a decade – a move that lifted the probation he dealt with for most of his adult life. The plea deal, which saw additional charges against Mill dropped, resolved a case that had become a flashpoint in the national debate over the US criminal justice system's treatment of black people. 21 Savage was meanwhile arrested just before last year's Grammys gala in his hometown Atlanta, with US immigration agents saying he had been living stateside illegally since overstaying a visa that expired in 2006, when he was a minor. The shock arrest surprised fans, who discovered the rapper – strongly associated with the southern capital of hip-hop – was in fact born in Britain.

The Eritrean-American born Ermias Asghedom was shot dead last March at age 33 in broad daylight, triggering an outpouring of grief in Los Angeles and among Hussle's superstar peers, who hailed both his musical talents and tireless community organizing.

Calayan Island, Cagayan With sweeping, panoramic 360-degree views of grassy cliffs carved by wind and water and the seemingly endless sea, and impossibly white beaches and turquoise waters, Calayan is an island definitely worth going to.  RAW CLIFFS. Nagudungan Hills offer views of nature-carved rock formations and the sea. Yes, this is despite the long journey (which can take around 17 hours or more, including a five-hour trip in the lampitaw, the local boat designed to pass through the occasionally rough waters to Calayan). Trips are thus best taken during the summer, though flights from Luzon mainland are planned for the future.  PRISTINE BEACH.

Australia's Nick Kyrgios (left) says he has 'respect' for Rafael Nadal despite their personal differences. Photo by Greg Baker/AFP MELBOURNE, Australia – Nick Kyrgios says it's ""pretty damn cool"" to be playing Rafael Nadal for a place in the Australian Open quarterfinals, predicting a physical battle against ""a hell of a player."" The two men have had a running feud since the outspoken Australian called Nadal ""super salty"" and his ""polar opposite"" last year after the Spaniard complained he ""lacks respect."" But Kyrgios was keen to hose down any differences and focus on the task ahead after battling through the longest match of his career to beat Karen Khachanov 6-2, 7-6 (7/5), 6-7 (6/8), 6-7 (7/9), 7-6 (10/8) on Saturday evening, January 25. ""I don't really dislike him. I don't know him at all. Hell of a tennis player. Don't know him as a person. I'm sure he's okay,"" he said, adding that there was ""a layer of respect"" between them. ""I'm super excited honestly. Playing one of the greatest tennis players on center court at your own Slam, it's pretty damn cool. ""Obviously it's going to be another physical battle. Nothing comes easy with him. He had a relatively routine (third round) match, so he's going to be feeling good. I'm looking forward to it. That's why you play, I guess."" Nadal earlier gave a cool response when asked whether he liked Kyrgios. ""When he does stuff that in my opinion is not good, I don't like,"" said 19-time Grand Slam winner and top seed. ""When he plays good tennis and he shows passion for this game, he is a positive player for our tour."" The pair have faced each other seven times before, with the world No. 1 holding a 4-3 advantage. Their last two encounters have been close affairs, including at Wimbledon last year when Nadal prevailed in a pulsating and bad-tempered second-round match over 4 dramatic sets. 'Too good' During the clash, the Australian ranted at the umpire and twice served underarm, infuriating the Spaniard. Afterwards he admitted he tried, and succeeded, in hitting Nadal with a stinging forehand. ""At the end of the day, we're two different tennis players,"" said Kyrgios, who appears to be trying hard this year to turn a corner from his petulant past. ""We go about it completely different. After Wimbledon, I lost, I got beaten by the better player. I shook his hand, looked him in the eye and said, 'Too good'."" But he took a lot out of that match, which he plans to put to good use on Monday, with the winner facing either France's Gael Monfils or Austrian 5th seed Dominic Thiem for a semifinal berth. ""Every time you put up a battle like that against Rafa, you're going to take confidence from it. Two tough tiebreaks. There's nothing in that match really,"" he said. ""He changed up his game plan a little bit. I'll probably expect him to serve a little bit more to my forehand when I play him in a couple days. That's what he did at Wimbledon."" Despite playing for 4 hours and 26 minutes against Khachanov, Kyrgios is confident he will be fully recovered and noted that he had enjoyed plenty of success before against left-handers like Nadal. ""Ever since juniors I enjoyed playing lefties. I feel like I kind of know what game plan I need to bring to be successful against them,"" he said. ""I mean, Rafa is a different beast altogether. ""I kind of know his patterns. Everyone knows his patterns, can't do anything about it. Federer knows his patterns. Everyone knows his patterns. He executes them at the highest level."" – Rappler.com  "

Photo by Gary Kwok/AFP HONG KONG, China – Hong Kong's Disneyland announced it was shutting its doors on Sunday, January 26, until further notice over the deadly virus outbreak in central China, a day after city authorities classified the crisis as an emergency. The park said it was taking the step to protect ""the health and safety of our guests and cast members"" and said refunds would be given. Ocean Park, a rival amusement park on Hong Kong's main island, said it was also closing its doors. On Saturday, Hong Kong classified the outbreak as an ""emergency"" – the city's highest warning tier – and announced ramped-up measures to reduce the risk of further infections. The move came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration's response to the crisis, including calls to halt, or limit, arrivals from the Chinese mainland where the epidemic began. Of the 5 people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, 4 arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland. Lam has resisted closing the border, saying the crisis is not yet at a point where such a drastic measure is needed. But she has announced all mainland arrivals must now sign health declaration forms. A series of public events, including a Lunar New Year gala and next month's marathon have also been cancelled. On Sunday, the nearby gambling hub of Macau announced 3 more cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing its total to 5. All 3 new cases were women who came from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic. One of the women had arrived in Macau via Hong Kong, authorities said. The closure of Disneyland and Ocean Park will pile fresh misery on Hong Kong's tourism, leisure and retail industries which have already been battered by more than 7 months of often-violent pro-democracy protests. Ocean Park is on track to receive a HK$10.6 billion (US$1.3 billion) government bailout over grim ticket sales in recent years. Combined with the US-China trade war fallout, the protests have helped tip Hong Kong into recession and the virus outbreak has only compounded the city's economic woes. Shanghai's Disneyland also closed from Saturday in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Hong Kong has firsthand experience of deadly viral outbreaks. Nearly 300 people were killed in the city by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. – Rappler.com "

South Korea's consulate in Wuhan said it was conducting an online poll of its citizens there to gauge demand for a chartered flight out. Fear in Wuhan Instead of New Year revelry, Wuhan has been seized by an eerie calm that deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million. Loudspeakers broke the silence by offering tips slathered with bravado. ""Do not believe in rumors. Do not spread rumors. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,"" the message said. ""Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,"" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding. The health emergency has overwhelmed Wuhan's hospitals with patients, prompting authorities to send hundreds of medical reinforcements, including military doctors, and start construction on two field hospitals. With non-essential vehicles banned from the road, volunteers stepped up to drive sick fellow citizens to hospitals. ""There has to be someone who does this,"" Zhang Lin, 48, told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home in nearly deserted streets. Some foreigners in Wuhan expressed deep concern, saying they feared going outside even though their food supplies were running low. ""We want to be evacuated as soon as possible, because either the virus, the hunger or the fear will kill us,"" Mashal Jamalzai, a political science student from Afghanistan at Central China Normal University, told Agence France-Presse. The outbreak is suspected to have originated in a Wuhan market where animals including rats, snakes and hedgehogs were reportedly sold as exotic food. China said Sunday it was banning all trade in wildlife until the emergency is over, but conservationists complain that China has previously failed to deliver on pledges to get tough. Another Disneyland closes Health officials said the virus has since become transmissible between humans. ""From what we see now, this disease is indeed ... not as powerful as SARS,"" said Gao Fu, head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press briefing in Beijing. However, it also appears that the ""spreading ability of the virus is getting stronger,"" said Ma Xiaowei, head of China's national health commission. Shanghai on Sunday reported its first death -- an 88-year-old man who had pre-existing health problems. The government says most deaths involved the elderly or people already suffering from other ailments. Fearing a repeat of SARS, China has dramatically scaled back celebrations and travel associated with the New Year holiday, which began Friday, while tourist sites like Beijing's Forbidden City and a section of the Great Wall have closed as a precaution. In Hong Kong, Disneyland announced Sunday it had closed as a precaution after the city declared an emergency to combat the crisis. Shanghai's Disneyland park had already closed Saturday.

The crew and cast of 'A Thousand Cuts' after the film's premiere. Photo by Camille Elemia/Rappler PARK CITY, United States – Award-winning filmmaker Ramona Diaz’s documentary on Rappler premiered at the iconic Egyptian Theater for the 2020 Sundance Film Festival on Saturday, January 25 (early January 26 in Manila). The film A Thousand Cuts, highlighting Rappler’s fight for press freedom under President Rodrigo Duterte, received a standing ovation after its premiere.  ""This is a risky film that drops us into a really dangerous drama between free press and a lawless regime,” said Harry Vaughn, programmer of the festival. “You have a president actively trying to dismantle truthful reporting and then you have journalists armed with no weapons but note pads demanding accountability,” Vaughn said. Rappler’s story is the story of many other news organizations worldwide, especially with the rise of populist and autocratic leaders. “This film takes place in the Philippines but its central conflict, as you may imagine, reverberates far beyond that country’s border,” Vaughn said. Drug war, disinformation Diaz initially wanted to do a documentary on Duterte’s bloody drug war. But this changed, she said, when she met Rappler CEO Maria Ressa. “When I met Maria, I knew it has to be press freedom. It is in that lens that I can do both issues – disinformation and drug war,” Diaz said during the panel after the premiere. Rappler investigative editor Chay Hofileña said the film depicts the group’s “story of survival.” Responding to questions from Americans, she said that they, too, should speak up. “You know people in the Philippines, they have begun to speak up and we see that. As the film showed you, it’s not always the case. There’s always threats to people back home. You’re safer here if you help us speak up and stand up to trolls on social media, because they really have an army.... You have same exeprience here, you must know how it feels,” Hofileña said. The free press has been under siege since the beginning of Duterte’s presidency. The former Davao City mayor has been known to publicly make threats, throw insults, and concoct allegations against members of the media. Rappler and its journalists have been the target of attacks – both online and offline – following critical reports about Duterte, his allies, and his so-called “drug war.” (LIST: Cases vs Maria Ressa, Rappler directors, staff since 2018) Ressa and several other Rappler executives have had to post bail numerous times since 2018 for a string of cases filed against them and the company. – Rappler.com "

White House counsel Pat Cipollone (R) and US President Donald Trump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow (L) arrive at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, January 22, 2020. Photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP WASHINGTON DC, USA – White House lawyers began their defense of Donald Trump at his historic Senate impeachment trial on Saturday, January 25, saying the president did nothing wrong in his dealings with Ukraine and American voters – not Congress – should decide his fate. White House counsel Pat Cipollone said it would be a ""completely irresponsible abuse of power"" if the Senate follows the lead of the House of Representatives and votes to remove the 45th US president from office. ""They're asking you to do something that no Senate has ever done,"" Cipollone told the 100 senators gathered on a rainy Saturday morning for a rare weekend session at just the third impeachment trial in US history. Democratic prosecutors from the House, which impeached Trump last month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, had not convincingly made their case that the president had committed ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" as demanded by the Constitution, Cipollone said. ""We don't believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they're asking you to do,"" he told a hushed Senate chamber. ""We believe when you hear the facts... you will find that the president did absolutely nothing wrong."" House prosecutors spent the previous 3 days laying out a detailed case that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to open an investigation into political rival Joe Biden and the former vice president's son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Adam Schiff, the chief House prosecutor, said the real estate tycoon turned politician poses an ""imminent threat"" to American democracy and his guiding principle is ""Trump first, not America first."" Cipollone argued that Democrats were asking the Senate to ""tear up all of the ballots"" from the 2016 presidential election and attempting to prevent Trump from running for reelection in November. ""They are here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history and we can't allow that to happen,"" the White House counsel said. ""Let the people decide for themselves."" 'Death Valley' The Democratic-controlled House impeached Trump on December 18 in a party-line vote, setting up a trial in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53 to 47 seat edge and the president enjoys the support of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, is required to remove a president from office and Democrats do not appear to have made any significant inroads so far in Trump's wall of Republican support. Following the session, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said the president's attorneys ""made a really compelling case"" for calling witnesses during the trial, a move Trump has opposed. Senator Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah and occasional Trump critic, said he was ""likely"" to support the Democrats' demand but other Republicans indicated that their minds were all but made up. ""Today we heard a case that was strong, that was clear and that completely undermined the case of the Democrats,"" Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, said of the White House defense. Just before his lawyers began speaking, Trump fired off a tweet with insulting nicknames for leading Democrats and told his supporters to tune in to the live television broadcast. The White House lawyers kept their opening arguments short – just under two hours – in part, perhaps, because Trump, a former reality television star, had complained that Saturday is the ""Death Valley"" of TV viewership. 'Impeachment Hoax' Following the defense presentation, Trump claimed it had demonstrated how ""unfairly"" he has been treated and showed he was the victim of a ""partisan Impeachment Hoax."" Trump's lawyers will resume his defense on Monday. They will have 24 hours spread over 3 days for their arguments but have said they are unlikely to use all the time allotted. Saturday's brief session was a relief to the 4 senators battling for the Democratic presidential nomination, allowing them to return to the campaign trail. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and Colorado Senator Michael Bennet have been forced to remain in Washington while Biden and other candidates campaign in Iowa, which kicks off the nominating process on February 3. Senators will have 16 hours next week to direct questions to both sides and consider whether they should subpoena witnesses, something Democrats have sought but Republicans have opposed. The questions from senators will be submitted in writing to US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial and will read them out loud. Americans appear about evenly split on whether Trump should be removed, though several polls show a healthy majority want the Senate to subpoena witnesses for Trump's trial. – Rappler.com "

Photo from OPAPP MANILA, Philippines – The new military commander in Eastern Mindanao vowed a strong campaign against communist guerrillas in one of the decades-long rebellion’s remaining strongholds, the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP) said on Sunday, January 26. Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Eastern Mindanao Command (Eastmincom) chief Major General Jose Faustino assumed his new post in a change-of-command ceremony at Naval Station Felix Apolinario in Panacan, Davao City, on Saturday, January 25. Eastmincom’s previous commander, General Felimon Santos Jr, was installed as AFP Chief-of-Staff on January 4. Faustino echoed Santos’ earlier message of pushing the administration’s objective to quash the rebellion of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA), by the end of President Rodrigo Duterte’s term in June 2022. ""We will not tire. We will not falter. We will break them hard so that no Filipino will become hostage to this godless communist ideology ever again,"" Faustino said during his assumption speech. Faustino highlighted the administration’s “localized, whole-of-nation approach” to battling the communists based on Duterte’s Executive Order (EO) no. 70, which Santos earlier hailed as having been successful in enticing hundreds of guerrillas to surrender, thus weakening the rebel forces. During the ceremony, Santos said that Eastmincom had so far cleared five NPA guerrilla fronts, dismantled four of the NPA’s Pulang Bagani battalions, and “neutralized” a large number of NPA members, including high-value targets. Faustino also vowed to ""take the fight to the heart of [the communists’] ideology, to the center of their comfort zones, and to the deepest and remotest guerrilla bases."" Mindanao veteran Faustino is a member of the Philippine Military Academy’s (PMA) “Maringal” class of 1988. Before becoming Eastmincom chief, he was the commander of the Philippine Army’s 10th Infantry Division based in Mindanao, headquartered in Compostela Valley province. The unit mainly battles communist rebels and extremist groups. Faustino once led the AFP’s 11th Intelligence Service Unit based in Davao City, the Army’s 35th Infantry Battalion in Western Mindanao, and then the 501st Infantry Brigade as its commander. He had also been the Tactical Officer and, eventually, Commandant of Cadets at the PMA. He spent his early years in the service with the First Scout Ranger Regiment, an elite Army unit. Push vs. communists After welcoming certain members of the communist movement into his administration early in his term, Duterte turned back on negotiations with the CPP’s political arm, the National Democratic Front (NDF), when the NPA allegedly carried on with attacks on government forces and civilians despite a ceasefire in late 2017. About a year later, Duterte issued EO 70, which created the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC). The NTF-ELCAC combines military and local government efforts to put pressure on individual communist rebel fronts, enticing guerrillas with cash and other incentives for their surrender, while military operations target their militias. Then in early December 2019, Duterte made a surprise offer to revive peace talks with the NDF. Preliminary exchanges between the two sides have so far failed to set the stage for actual negotiations, and security officials said that military operations against the communists would continue unless Duterte orders a ceasefire. The military and police have been increasingly aggressive in pursuing the NPA, including groups they said were “legal fronts” of the rebellion. In 2019, tensions rose as progressive groups such as the Gabriela Women’s Party were “red-tagged” or branded as NPA proxies, sparking outrage among the groups' members and human rights advocates. – Rappler.com "

Even at 44, Tiger Woods continues to chase records. Photo from Twitter/@PGATOUR LOS ANGELES, USA – Tiger Woods charged into contention for a record-setting 83rd all-time US PGA title on Saturday, January 25, shooting a three-under par 69 as he chases a ninth career victory at the Torrey Pines. Woods began the third round of the Farmers Insurance Open 6 strokes adrift of leader Ryan Palmer, but stood on seven-under 209 after 54 holes, 5 back of leader Jon Rahm with the third-ranked Spaniard having two holes yet to finish. ""I'm going to have to shoot a pretty good round tomorrow,"" Woods said. ""I'll have my work cut out for me. I'll have go out there and post a number and hopefully it will be good enough."" Second-ranked Rory McIlroy, needing a victory to return to world No. 1, moved into the No.3 spot with a stellar 67 to stand 3 adrift on 207, but the bid for history by Woods stole the spotlight. The 44-year-old reigning Masters champion matched Sam Snead for the US PGA record of 82 triumphs with an October victory in Japan and could claim the mark alone on Sunday at the seaside San Diego layout. Woods, a 15-time major winner, fought back from 9 strokes down after 36 holes to win at Torrey Pines in 1999 and twice rallied from 7 back in the last two rounds to win. Fog delayed the start by two hours but Woods shone brightly once he began. Woods blasted from a fairway bunker to 13 feet and sank the putt to open with a birdie, conquering the same first hole where he four-putted to a double bogey on Friday. He then curled in a seven-foot birdie putt on the par-3 third and rolled in a 17-foot chip to rescue par at the fourth. After blasting out of the rough, Woods holed a 13-foot birdie putt at the par-5 sixth and dropped his approach 3 feet from the cup on the way to making birdie at the par-5 ninth to reach 8-under, only two off the lead. ""Most of my putts I made were all uphill,"" Woods said. ""It's important to leave the ball in the correct spots, and when I did, I poured them in there."" Woods made bogey at the par-3 11th, coming up 6 feet short on a 62-foot birdie bid and missing his par putt. From there, Woods grinded out 7 concluding pars, the most crucial on a 15-foot putt – his longest putt of the day – at the par-5 18th after he found bunkers off the tee and with his third shot. ""It was important to save the round after I made a bogey back there,"" Woods said. ""It was important to make that putt to salvage the round a little bit and get some momentum going for the round tomorrow."" McIlroy packs patience McIlroy sank a 19-foot birdie putt at the par-3 third, took his lone bogey at 4, then birdied the par-5 sixth and ninth holes. On the back nine, McIlroy birdied the par-4 12th and 15th and par-5 18th – the exact same trio of holes where he made bogeys on Friday. ""I hit the ball well off the tee. I gave myself plenty of chances,"" said McIlroy. ""If you can pack your patience around this place, just hang around, you should be okay."" ""No one is going to go out here and shoot the lights out. If you keep putting it on the green and give yourself chances, you're going to do well out here."" As much as McIlroy wants to reclaim the world No. 1 spot for the first time since 2015, the four-time major winner from Northern Ireland wants to capture a title missing from his collection. ""I'd love to [be No. 1],"" McIlroy said. ""I want to win a golf tournament. I've never won here before. That's my goal here tomorrow – let's go win a new event."" – Rappler.com "

The 14th seed Kenin recovered from a set down to win convincingly 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-0 on Sunday, January 26. Kenin plays China's 27th seed Wang Qiang – who beat Serena Williams in the last round – or Tunisia's Ons Jabeur in the quarterfinals in Melbourne. ""I just did the best I can. I just tried to take it like any other match,"" said Kenin. ""I know she's playing well, I just tried to play my game and fight for every point and just not focus on anything else."" Gauff, the youngest player in the draw, departed the court in tears. But she has been one of the stories of the Australian Open, beating Venus Williams in the first round and then stunning reigning champion Naomi Osaka in the third round. Gauff, who turns 16 in March, was attempting to become the youngest player to win a Grand Slam in the Open Era, which began in 1968. The current record-holder is Martina Hingis, who triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open aged 16 years and 105 days. But Gauff was under the cosh immediately against Kenin – the 21-year-old breaking in the first game at Melbourne Arena and comfortably holding for a swift 2-0 lead. There was no mistaking who the crowd wanted to win as each point for Gauff was greeted with cheers and screams, while there was only polite applause for the Moscow-born Kenin. Gauff, ranked No. 67, recovered to gain parity for 4-4 and they went to the tie-break after Kenin saved set point. She then stepped it up a gear in the tie-break – aided by two Kenin double-faults – to take the first set in 58 minutes. The younger American had a powerful serve but she was totting up the double faults, her seventh of the match offering Kenin a second break point with the latter 2-1 up. A resurgent Kenin – the determination etched on her face – broke at the third time lucky to lead 3-1, triggering a rare show of anger from the teenager. Kenin took the following set in 38 minutes and carried the momentum into the deciding set, breaking Gauff to love in the opening game and racing towards victory. Touted as heir apparent to Serena Williams, Gauff burst onto the scene when she beat Venus Williams in the Wimbledon first round last year on her Grand Slam debut. She went out in the fourth round to eventual champion Simona Halep, but a star was born. Gauff lost to then-world No. 1 Osaka in the third round at the US Open, but got her revenge at the same stage in Melbourne, more evidence of her huge potential.

In a statement on Sunday, January 26, Colmenares and MSK called on Congress to investigate Meralco's ""questionable acts,"" as they reiterated MSK's petition filed with the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) in late 2019 seeking the refund. The ERC reportedly blocked MSK's petition, which claimed that Meralco used outdated figures in calculating the distribution rate it charged consumers from 2013 to 2018. MSK said the company based its charges on lower energy sales and annual growth rate figures instead of actual numbers from the period, which meant that consumers were made to shoulder a larger portion of distribution costs in their monthly bills than was necessary.

Over the years, consumer rights groups have questioned the way Meralco computes electricity bills.

In other words, the ERC was ordered to check whether Meralco was using the right figures on which to base the amount it passes on to consumers, to the effect that consumers end up paying as little as possible, as the law requires. The SC was then acting on a complaint from the National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reforms, a consumer rights group. – Rappler.com "
515,250232,"January 26, 2020",Relationships,[Two Pronged] Wanting more from a 'casual relationship',Dr Margie Holmes and Jeremy Baer,"Donna starts a casual relationship – with someone who is apparently already married. But now she wants more.    Rappler's Life and Style section runs an advice column by couple Jeremy Baer and clinical psychologist Dr Margarita Holmes. Jeremy has a master's degree in law from Oxford University. A banker of 37 years who worked in 3 continents, he has been training with Dr Holmes for the last 10 years as co-lecturer and, occasionally, as co-therapist, especially with clients whose financial concerns intrude into their daily lives Together, they have written two books: Love Triangles: Understanding the Macho-Mistress Mentality and Imported Love: Filipino-Foreign Liaisons. Dear Dr. Holmes and Mr. Baer, I met a guy from a dating app and started a casual relationship. I wanted to get rid of my virginity without commitment and he wanted to keep it fun, and so we did. We texted non-stop for a week before going on our first date. I asked him directly several times if he's single and he said he is. On our second date, we both decided to give it a go and we both enjoyed it. However, before our third date, I found it he's married someone just 6 months ago, so it baffled me. He apologized profusely and said he's feeling guilty. I asked him why he lied to me and all he could say is because he really likes me. I asked him what if I told his wife? He said he would accept the consequences. I asked him if he was unhappy. He said he wasn't. I asked him why he married his wife, he said he didn't want to answer via PM that question. I know I should have walked away but we both decided to continue our conversations which includes mundane stuff and not just about sex. Now I want more than a one night stand, which I am trying to suppress. However, he's making it hard since he's made it clear that he wants me and even said he'll settle for a kiss if I don't want to have sex. Why is it that we both feel like we want more? Sincerely, Donna Dear Donna, So you started out wanting to get rid of your virginity in a way that would not bring any unwanted complications. What better than a casual hookup via a dating site! And your efforts were duly crowned with success; you lost your virginity to a total stranger who just wanted “to keep it fun."" Despite this, the relationship which you embraced because it was to be free of commitment, changed character. First, you discovered he was married and this disturbed you. You do not, however, explain why you initially reacted negatively to something that merely confirmed his lack of commitment, which was after all a requirement of yours from the outset. Perhaps this was because you changed your mind about the nature of the relationship you wanted. We don’t know. Anyway, having found to your displeasure that he was married, you didn’t sever all ties with him, which would have been understandable, but instead carried on communicating which seems to fly in the face of wanting no commitment (unless you felt that being married removed all possibility of commitment). Now you and he ""want more."" That he should want more is plausible. He has a wife and now a mistress; what’s not to like? He can see you when he wishes and life with his wife and family go on. For you the situation is different. You don’t have a true boyfriend, merely that part of this guy that his family won’t miss – in other words, you have zero control over the time you will get to spend together. If he is that fantastic, carry on. Otherwise there are plenty of other fish in the ocean, not all of which are encumbered with a Mrs Fish. All the best, JAF Baer Dear Donna, Thank you very much for your letter. I will limit my comments to why it is that he seems (operative word: “seems”) to want more; since answering why YOU do will require much deeper analysis, and your answer to many more questions, some of which you may consider intrusive. I am afraid I may come across as really sexist, but my clinical experience confirms that men and women react very differently to offers of sex. For example, over 40 years ago, we at the now-defunct Population Center Foundation conducted a study where the result showed a clear sexual/gender divide. When asked when they would consider having sex with their partner, all the female students said if they truly loved the guy. A majority of the male students had a much lower bar: as long as she said yes, they were willing. Eager to discover whether this was a quirk of Filipino sexuality or universal, I researched Elaine Hatfield (in the 70’s considered the premier sex researcher in the US). In the Journal of Psychology & Human Sexuality, Russell and Hatfield wrote “Gender differences in receptivity to sexual offers” and discovered that when a female student approached males on campus and asks, ""Would you like to go to bed with me tonight?"" 75% of the men said yes. The same scenario, with the genders reversed, had this result: 0% of the women said yes. Several other studies have replicated Russell’s and Hatfield’s study and come up with the same result: Men are more willing to engage in casual sex than women are and to lie to get the women to say yes. In that sense, your guy is behaving true to form. In a 2010 article written by Notre Dame Professor Anita E. Kelly she concludes that “when a guy wants to have sex with you, it doesn't necessarily mean he likes you. He might like you; it's just that his wanting sex doesn't tell you anything about his commitment to you."" Again, this fits your guy to a T. Oh, Donna. Your and his wanting more from your relationship doesn’t necessarily mean you want the same thing.  You sound like you now want a relationship and not just a casual hookup. But I feel that what he really wants is more sex from you, an enthusiastic, albeit innocent partner. Mr Baer and I could be wrong, but somehow I doubt it. Oh dear, that makes us sound sooooo mayabang, but (sigh) I still feel we are correct. Good luck dearest Donna, and tell us how it pans out, ok?

Fissures or cracks appear in some roads in Barangay Bangin, Agoncillo, Batangas, on January 15, 2020. Photo by Alecs Ongcal/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas said around 22,000 houses may have been damaged due to the eruption of Taal Volcano, and residents are advised not to return. The governor gave updates and issued announcements after Taal Volcano was downgraded to Alert Level 3 on Sunday, January 26, following two weeks of being under Alert Level 4. ""Sa ngayon, ito'y kukumpirmahin pa ha, 22,000 bahay, hindi na mababalikan.... Hindi lang sira...hindi na dapat balikan pa,"" said Mandanas in a briefing on Sunday afternoon, adding that these homes are in Taal Volcano Island and nearby barangays. (For now, this has yet to be confirmed, but around 22,000 houses cannot be returned to anymore. They're not only damaged, they shouldn't be returned to anymore.) A rapid damage assessment will be conducted to verify the number of totally and partially damaged houses, Batangas provincial disaster risk reduction and management head Lito Castro later said in the briefing. According to Mandanas, the provincial government is planning the resettlement of affected residents. (LOOK: Eyed relocation site for Taal evacuees in Ibaan, Batangas) ""Hindi pa confirmed kung ilan talaga, but initial estimate, 22,000 new houses for resettlement. Meron na tayong resettlement area, pero hindi pa tapos ang mga kalsada, kuryente, tubig. Kaya sila, bago matapos ay dalawang taon. Dahil ang ating tunay na resettlement areas, kailangan din, may hanapbuhay,"" he said. (It's not yet confirmed, but the initial estimate is that there will be 22,000 new houses for resettlement. We already have a resettlement area, but its roads, electricity, and water facilities are not yet finished. Maybe it would take two years, because effective resettlement areas need to foster livelihood.) More assistance, funding They also plan to give assistance to affected residents and buy their livestock. ""'Yung mga nag-aalaga ng hayop, baka walang maipakain, bibilhin lahat ng lalawigan sa ating pondo at may tulong pa na pinangako ang Department of Agriculture. 'Yung mga nasa isla, bibilhin din, patay o buhay,"" Mandanas added. (To those taking care of animals, maybe they can't feed them anymore, we'll buy their animals using the province's funds, besides the help promised by the Department of Agriculture. Those from the volcano island, we'll also buy their livestock, dead or alive.) The provincial veterinarian will be in charge of buying livestock, said Castro. Mandanas said Batangas will increase its calamity fund to over P300 million from P60 million. Its regular fund will also be increased by P2 billion to cover short-term expenses for 6 months. These are besides what the national government would provide, the governor said. He also earlier asked China for a grant to boost recovery and rehabilitation efforts in Batangas. Areas on lockdown Mandanas reiterated that the towns of Agoncillo and Laurel remain on lockdown. But the governor is allowing mayors and barangay officials to provide window hours for residents to briefly come back. While the lockdown has been lifted in other towns, residents should still be ready to evacuate again within one hour in case the Taal unrest worsens. Classes in Batangas for preschool, elementary, and high school students remain suspended until further notice, said Mandanas, because many schools are being used as evacuation centers. But the evacuees will eventually be transferred to other evacuation centers so that classes can resume. In addition, Batangas will set up assistance centers in barangays and town centers. – Rappler.com "

Photo from the Public Information Office- City of Baguio BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – The Baguio City local government has issued demolition notices to the owners of some 110 structures within the declared 150-meter buffer zone of the Loakan airport in preparation for its return to commercial operations, the city’s public information office (PIO) said on Friday, January 24. Around 200 structures have earlier been identified to be within the buffer zone and the issuance of demolition notices will continue, according to Engr. Stephen Capuyan, who heads the city's Buildings and Architecture Office (CBAO) investigation and demolition division. The notices will be issued every Tuesday, he said. Capuyan added that owners are given 7 days to “voluntarily demolish” the structures upon receipt of the notice or present documents as proof of ownership of their properties. The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) has declared 75 meters on both sides of the airport as a buffer zone that must be clear of any obstructions for the safety of the aircraft that will land and take off from Loakan. The local government has pushed for the airport's opening for commercial flights to entice “high end visitors to consider spending their short breaks in the country’s undisputed Summer Capital,” the PIO said. Only chartered and military flights are allowed to use the Loakan airport, which was closed for commercial flights more than a decade ago over safety and other technical aviation issues. Loakan has one of the shortest runways in the country, with its airstrip just a little over 1.6 kilometers. But the local government has said that this length is “sufficient to cater to the taxi and take off requirements of small aircrafts wanting to service the route.” Loakan airport was almost closed for good several years ago with the proposal to convert it into an expansion area of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) but the city government fought for its continued operations, citing its importance to the local tourism industry. – Rappler.com "

Efren ""Bata"" Reyes will be recognized for his contributions to Philippine sports. Photo by Lisa Marie David/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The magic may have waned, but the legend lives on. Efren ""Bata"" Reyes remains one of the top draws in Philippine sports even at the age of 65 as shown in the recent 30th Southeast Asian Games. The iconic pool player with the charismatic smile still packed them in and was easily the most sought after member of the men's billiards and snooker team. Reyes, with his deteriorating eyesight, only settled for a bronze in the men's carom – not exactly his pet event – during the region meet, but nonetheless, was an inspiring presence in the team winning a total of 12 medals, 4 of them golds. For all his greatness, ""The Magician"" has yet to conquer the SEA Games where his highest finish was a bronze, 5 times to be exact, and all of them in men's carom. Yet, that does not diminish a bit what the Mexico, Pampanga pride has achieved in the pool table, where he has been universally acknowledged as the greatest player of all time. For that, Reyes is set to be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA) during the traditional SMC-PSA Awards Night on March 6 at the Centennial Hall of the Manila Hotel. At the same time, ""Bata"" will serve as special guest speaker during the gala night in a rare function for a man known for his few words. He became the second straight athlete to become guest speaker in the event presented by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), MILO, Cignal TV, PBA, and Rain or Shine after Olympian Bea Lucero last year. Team Philippines is the recipient of the coveted Athlete of the Year award from the country's oldest media organization for defying the odds and winning the overall championship of the SEA Games. Reyes incidentally, was a three-time winner of the Athlete of the Year plum solely given by the PSA in 1999, 2001, and 2006. For the Lifetime Achievement Award, Reyes, whose humble beginnings and simple demeanor endeared him to the Filipino masses, was a hands-down choice following the massive success he achieved both in the local and world stage. The long list of honor include being the best player to win world championships in two different pool disciplines, having reigned as both world eight-ball and world nine-ball champion. He was also the first non-American to win the US Open 9-Ball Championship, became the inaugural winner of the World Cup of Pool in tandem with good friend Francisco ""Django"" Bustamante, acknowledged as the winningest player in the history of the Annual Derby City Classic with 5 titles, and won the largest prize money in the history of pocket billiards after topping the IPT World Open 8-Ball Championship worth $500,000. Known for his legendary ability to ""kick safe"" the ball, Reyes topped the billiards money list 5 times, including a record earnings of $646,000 in 2006. While still active, he was already inducted into the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame in 2003. Last year, the PSA honored bowling great Bong Coo and cycling champion Paquito Rivas with the Lifetime Achievement Award. – Rappler.com  "

Plastic in the Philippines During an advanced screening of the documentary at the University of the Philippines (UP) Film Institute on Wednesday, January 22, The Story of Plastic Executive Producer Stiv Wilson recalled seeing the extent of the plastic problem when he visited the infamous Smokey Mountain landfill in Tondo, Manila. (READ: Smelly, sticky, wet: Making it work in the dumps of Tondo) “At that moment, I resolved to make The Story of Plastic. I understood plastic as an ocean issue, but I didn’t understand it as a human rights issue, from a developing world standpoint,” said Wilson. In a widely-cited 2015 report, the Philippines was listed as one of the top 3 contributors to plastic waste in the ocean.

Zero waste in UP For UP Diliman, it is a challenge that they are willing to take on. Dr Fidel Nemenzo, vice chancellor for research and development and one of the candidates for the next UP Diliman chancellor, shared how he wants the university to join the fight against plastic. Among the efforts he proposed were encouraging students to bring their own utensils; issuing guidelines to cafeteria operators, food establishments, and caterers to minimize food waste and packaging; and installing a water fountain in every building. The vice chancellor plans on using a multidisciplinary approach in creating solutions. “We will challenge all the professors and all the disciplines to help address this problem...and think about the institutional governance mechanisms that are necessary for such a campaign,” Nemenzo said. Nemenzo emphasized how students are also integral in understanding and communicating the plastic pollution crisis to other communities.

This file picture taken on May 26, 2003 shows a policeman watching over a civet cat captured in the wild by a farmer in Wuhan, in central China's Hubei province. Photo by AFP BEIJING, China – China on Sunday, January 26, ordered a temporary ban on the trade in wild animals as the country struggles to contain a deadly virus believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild animals as food. Raising, transporting or selling all wild animal species is forbidden ""from the date of the announcement until the national epidemic situation is over,"" said a government directive. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The ban was issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Administration for Market Regulation, and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. The lethal virus, which has caused 56 confirmed deaths and nearly 2,000 total infections in China, and spread to about a dozen countries, is believed to have originated in a market in the central city of Wuhan, where a range of wildlife was reportedly sold. Conservationists have long accused China of tolerating a shadowy trade in exotic animals for food or as ingredients in traditional medicines, including highly endangered species such as the pangolin or tiger. Health experts say the trade poses a significant and growing public health risk as potentially dangerous animal-borne pathogens that people would normally not be exposed to make the jump to humans. The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 also has been traced to wild animals, with scientists saying it likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets. Civets, a cat-like creature, were among dozens of species listed on an exhaustive price list for one of the animal-trading businesses at the Wuhan market that emerged online last week. Other items included various rats, snakes, giant salamanders and even live wolf pups. Sunday's announcement said all businesses, markets, food and beverage outlets, and e-commerce platforms are ""strictly prohibited from trading in wild animals in any form."" It added that ""consumers must fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals, avoid wild game, and eat healthy."" The so-called bushmeat trade, along with broader human encroachment on wild habitats, is bringing humans into ever-closer contact with animal viruses that can spread rapidly in today's connected world, scientists say. A study by the Global Virome Project, a worldwide effort to increase preparedness for pandemics, estimated that there are nearly 1.7 million undiscovered viruses in the animal kingdom, nearly half of which could be harmful to humans. Peter Daszak, a virology expert with the project, told Agence France-Presse its research also indicated that we can expect around 5 new animal-borne pathogens to infect humanity each year. China has launched previous crackdowns on the wildlife trade, including after SARS, but conservationists say the trade typically resumes over time. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Sabah Arar/AFP BAGHDAD, Iraq – Security forces shot live rounds to clear protest hotspots in Baghdad and southern Iraq for a second day on Sunday, January 26, sparking skirmishes with demonstrators determined to keep up their movement. The anti-government protesters had feared their campaign would be squashed when riot police Saturday moved in on their tent camps in the capital, the southern port city of Basra, the holy city of Najaf and other cities. But the demonstrators returned in large numbers in the evening and on Sunday morning, with security forces trying to clear them out again. In the capital, they used live rounds in an attempt to disperse small anti-government rallies in Khallani and Wathba squares, near the main protest camp of Tahrir Square, according to a police source. At least 17 protesters were wounded, including 6 with bullet wounds, the source said. The young demonstrators have mostly thrown rocks at riot police but some have tossed Molotov cocktails. In Nasiriyah to the south, security forces also fired live rounds but there was no immediate word on casualties. Protesters had gathered there in large numbers after police reopened main thoroughfares in Nasiriyah leading to the central protest camp in Habbubi Square. The youth-dominated protests erupted in Baghdad and the Shiite-majority south on October 1 in outrage over lack of jobs, poor services and rampant corruption. Met with violence, they quickly spiralled into calls for a total government overhaul. Rallies are now specifically demanding snap elections, the appointment of an independent premier and the prosecution of anyone implicated in corruption or the recent bloodshed. But activists worry they could face a wider crackdown after firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr dropped his support for the movement on Friday. The notoriously fickle militia leader-turned-politician backed the protests when they first started and even called on the government to resign. His supporters had widely been recognized as the most organized and well-stocked protesters in Tahrir. But after holding an anti-US rally in Baghdad that was attended by thousands, Sadr said he no longer wanted to be involved in the regime change movement. Within hours, his supporters were dismantling their tents in protest camps across the country and riot police began moving in on demonstrations. But activists issued an urgent call for help, and young demonstrators flooded Tahrir and other areas. – Rappler.com "

Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Defending champion Novak Djokovic swept past Diego Schwartzman and into an Australian Open quarterfinal with Milos Raonic as he zeroes in on an eighth Melbourne Park title. The rampant Serbian No. 2 seed was on another level against the 14th seed Argentine, cruising to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win on Sunday, January 26, at the Rod Laver Arena for an 11th appearance in the last 8. Raonic is his next hurdle and the Canadian has also been in fine touch. He has yet to drop a set, blasting past fellow former world No. 3 Marin Cilic, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5. ""Milos is one of the tallest, strongest players on tour and has one of the biggest serves,"" said Djokovic, who is into his 46th Grand Slam quarterfinal, second only to Roger Federer's 57. ""I've got to be ready for missiles coming from his side of the net. One key element will be how well I'm returning."" The Serb has met 32nd seed Raonic 9 times and won them all. But the Canadian is back to full fitness after years of injury struggles and his powerful serve could cause problems. So far, he has served 59 games and won them all. Asked what he needs to do to beat Djokovic, he replied:  ""I think I'm going to have to hit more than 35 aces,"" referring to the number he pumped past 2018 finalist Cilic. ""I think we play quite opposite from each other, and he's done a good job in the past neutralising my serve,"" he added of the Serb. ""So I have really got to focus on my things well and be the one dictating."" The Australian Open is Raonic's favorite Slam. He reached the semifinals in 2016, when he lost to Andy Murray, and the quarters on 3 other occasions, including last year. His career, though, has been plagued by injuries, with operations over the years for hip, foot, and wrist problems. He has also struggled with back, ankle, calf, and knee issues. Raonic said it felt ""pretty damn good"" to finally be injury free. Quality player While Djokovic had won all 3 of his past meetings against Schwartzman, the Argentine had caused him problems previously and he needed to come from two sets down at Roland Garros in 2017 to win. Despite thism the writing was on the wall – the Argentine had never beaten a top 5 player in 21 clashes and it wasn't about to change Sunday. They went game for game in the opening set until Djokovic pounced, working a break point to get the crucial edge and go 5-3 in front. Sensing a quick victory, he stormed to a 3-0 lead in the following set, breaking twice. But Schwartzman is a fighter who runs and scraps for every ball and he pulled back a break, only for the world No. 2 to calmly serve out the set. The scurrying Schwartzman is renowned as one of the fastest men around court and did all he could to claw back into the match.

All screenshots from YouTube/Viva Films TERROR. Yam Concepcion stars in 'Nightshift.' All screenshots from YouTube/Viva Films Ever since Sigaw (2004), Yam Laranas has been aspiring for another hit, a film that would prove that the ghost story about lovers living in a haunted apartment wasn't a fluke. Sadly, from schlocky Patient X (2009), to conceptually ambitious but confusedly directed The Road (2011), to starkly unwatchable Abomination (2018), to the loud but dragging Aurora (2018), the cinematographer-turned-director could never seem to hit the right balance of creative elegance and uncomplicated entertainment that made Sigaw a success despite its obvious lack of originality. He has gotten stuck in the past, with films that feel outdated, especially in a market crowded with genre films that are built not on formula but on risk. A pleasant surprise Nightshift is, therefore, such a pleasant surprise. It has glaring problems. For example, while it indulges in the dreadful doldrums of working in a hospital morgue, it still succumbs to the temptations of a twist ending that betrays its allegiance to the terrors of noble labor. Clearly, Laranas is still beholden to the formula of laying down clues and hints to prepare for a revelation that upends expectations. Sadly, in this case, the surprise in the end is a glaring liability. It is a betrayal of the intricate deep dive into the life of an overworked morgue assistant whose anxieties and exhaustion turn her shift into a nightmare. The film works best when it introduces its contained universe of hospital-bound weirdos, all interesting because of how they cope with the macabre nature of their workplace. An enterprising tandem (Soliman Cruz and Epy Quizon) seeks to earn money for every action, waging bets on whether the lights would blink whenever they pass by with a corpse in tow, pilfering valuables from the dead, and charging fees for carrying cadavers into storage bins. Investigators (Roman Perez and Mayen Estanero) have the most suspicious ways of squeezing out confessions out of their suspects, forcing them to look at the corpses of their victims so that they can exploit whatever guilt remains in the hearts of murderers and other lowlifes. Laranas ultimately succeeds in crafting an intriguing ecosystem within the hidden basement of the hospital. Unraveling ecosystem It is through the eyes of week-old morgue assistant Jessie (Yam Concepcion) that such ecosystem unravels. She is guided by Dr. Alex (Michael de Mesa) whose nonchalance when it comes to cadavers suddenly moving or making strange noises forms part of the wickedly absurd universe that makes Nightshift intriguing, despite its faults. There is a certain allure to how Laranas slowly but surely has the mysteries of the morgue unfold, shifting from the banal to the mystical, creating an indecipherable rhythm to the horrors of the workplace. Sure, he peppers the film with typical scares, creeping sounds and standard shocks, but it is the depicted callousness of the characters towards blatant symbols of mortality that is truly unsettling. Nightshift gets the look and feel mostly right. The film doesn’t overdo the production, settling instead in marrying the fluorescent-lighted corners of the morgue with clever touches of things purposely strange and out of place. Laranas succeeds in creating that distinct mood and atmosphere to house that tricky vision of mining fear from fatigue and morbidity. His ensemble contributes greatly to keep that vision intact, turning an insulated experience into an allegory for the end of the world.  FEELING. 'Nightshift' is the latest movie from director Yam Laranas, known for 'Sigaw,' and 'Aurora.' Compelling stuff A lot of Nightshift is compelling stuff. It is just unfortunate that Laranas had to rely on old tricks to conclude what could have been a more mystical cinematic experience that connects the hazards of labor with the philosophical aspects of mortality. – Rappler.com   Francis Joseph Cruz litigates for a living and writes about cinema for fun.

Ai-Ai delas Alas stars in 'D'Ninang.' All screenshots from YouTube/Regal Entertainment Inc D'NINANG. Ai-Ai delas Alas stars in 'D'Ninang.' All screenshots from YouTube/Regal Entertainment Inc The problem with GB Sampedro’s D'Ninang is indecisiveness. It isn’t a bad movie. It’s just that its promise is derailed by mismatched intentions and misdirection. Comedic treatment The plot doesn’t beg for a comedic treatment. In fact, its grooves are akin to Hirokazu Koreeda’s Shoplifters (2018), a drama about a family surviving through petty criminality whose specific circumstances lead to moments of humor. In Sampedro’s film, the family, headed by Ditas (Ai Ai delas Alas), is also eking out its existence through various forms of thievery. Everything is sweet and dandy until Ditas’ former flame dies, which forces her to take into her peculiar household her biological daughter (Kisses Delavin), disrupting their illicit business as they all pretend that their means and ways are all above board. There are scenes that are so absurd, they are funny on their own. What ultimately becomes the film’s undoing is Sampedro’s insistence on infusing the entire film with manufactured humor, those unsubtle details that beg the audience to laugh. The narrative doesn’t call for inanity or ridiculousness. It thrives in balancing drama and levity, shifting from depictions of what supposedly should be compelling emotions to droll moments that arise from the fact that the situations are by themselves worth a chuckle. Sampedro is sadly incapable of a balancing act. He prefers to be loud and unsubtle, when the best option is to let the scenes work the magic. D’Ninang ends up grossly fake when it could have been endearing and charming.  THIEF WITH A GOOD HEART. Ai-Ai is Ditas, who steals but also lends money to those who needs. Doesn’t know what it wants to be D’Ninangdoesn’t know what it wants to be. It doesn’t know if it wants to be an boisterous comedy or a humorous family drama. Because Sampedro is confused, the performances in the film end up as bewildered as they are bewildering. De Las Alas, for example, inelegantly jumps from being the outrageous comedienne she has become known for in films like Wenn Deramas’ Ang Tanging Ina (2003) to the dramatic actress she's been desperately trying to be known for with films like Louie Ignacio’s Area (2016) and School Service (2018). It doesn’t help that De Las Alas wears a preposterous wig that renders her impossible to take seriously, even in the scenes where she tries her best to commit to the gravity and sincerity of the situation. The best performers in the D’Ninang are the actors and actresses who aren’t cast to add further comedic flavor to the project. Delavin is a much-needed sobering presence. The scenes that she shares with onscreen partner McCoy De Leon are charming because the chemistry isn’t as forced as the gags and jokes. Newcomer Angel Guardian, who plays Ditas’ adopted daughter, is also a revelation. What’s apparent here is that the performers who have least to prove and have not been relegated to stereotyped roles are the ones who are granted with the most flexibility to interpret their characters. Missed opportunity D’Ninang is a missed opportunity. Instead of becoming a family drama tainted with dark comedy, it ends up becoming a dreary mess. – Rappler.com   Francis Joseph Cruz litigates for a living and writes about cinema for fun.

CA Associate Justice Elihu Ybañez of the Special 14th Division penned the 46-page decision that upgraded the 4 convicts' sentence of reclusion perpetua, or 20 years and 1 day to 40 years in prison, to reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole. The decision also said they should have been sentenced to death, if not for the abolition of the death penalty in 2006. Besides Carungcong, the other appellants were Chief Inspector Exequiel Cautiver, Alejandro Entrolizo, and Mariano de Leon alias ""Spider."" Cautiver was a commanding officer of the Philippine National Police's Special Action Force at Fort Santo Domingo. Cautiver's wife, Chief Inspector Penelope Cautiver, was initially found guilty as well.

In 2016, Judge Eugenio dela Cruz of Pasay City Regional Trial Court Branch 117 convicted Carungcong and the others for kidnapping and killing businessman Demosthenes Cañete and driver Allan Garay in June 2008. Cañete was Carungcong's brother-in-law, according to reports. The suspects got the P20-million ransom they demanded, but killed Cañete and Garay anyway. Authorities found the victims' bodies in separate locations: Cañete in Porac, Pampanga, and Garay in Valenzuela City. In the CA ruling, the appellants were ordered to jointly pay Cañete's heirs P100,000 as civil indemnity, P100,000 as moral damages, and P100,000 as exemplary damages. This is on top of paying actual damages of P425,670.57 which was spent for Cañete's burial. The same amounts for civil, moral, and exemplary damages should be paid to Garay's heirs.

""Palakitik always ran up to greet the group's boats and followed workers around everywhere they went,"" PETA said. Earlier, the group met with government officials to discuss how best to rescue the remaining animals on the island.

A provenance economy, explained IPOPHL, is a source of a counterfeit good, whether it is a producer or a point of transit.

Then, while the 4th joint study published in 2019 ""aimed to recalibrate the findings with more updated data and an enhanced methodology,"" IPOPHL said the results ""were presented in ways that make them unsuitable for comparison."" ""In fact, the previous [European Commission] watch list report, released in 2018, even commended the country for efforts we have been amplifying since then,"" said Pascua. He highlighted IPOPHL's push to amend the Intellectual Property Code of 1998, continuous efforts to champion several IP initiatives in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the launch of the National IP Strategy in December 2019. The agency also said it has taken steps to fast-track the decision-making in IPR cases by collaborating with the judiciary to revise the current special rules on IP litigation. In addition, Pascua noted that the 2019 European Commission report's coverage was only up to August 31, 2019. ""We expect that once IPOPHL's and NCIPR's (National Committee on Intellectual Property Rights) efforts in the last quarter of 2019 are factored in, including the manifold projects and programs we intend to take in the next few years, the European Commission will give a more positive evaluation of the Philippines in its next report,"" he added. – Rappler.com "

The pair have never met before, as Federer noted: ""I've played a lot of tennis in my life but never against Tennys."" Millman epic The ageless Federer was pushed to a gruelling 5 sets by John Millman in the third round, but showed no signs of tiredness against Fucsovics despite being 38. Both players took time to feel each other out and it went with serve to 3-3 before the Hungarian grabbed the first break on the back of some high quality service returns. The unheralded 27-year-old, ranked 67, looked composed, with his power and aggressive forehand unsettling Federer and he held his nerve to grab the set – the first he had ever taken off the Swiss. Undaunted, Federer kept his cool, started to find Fucsovic's weaknesses, and dictated the points, earning a break to go 2-0 ahead in the 2nd set. He did not let up as the Hungarian struggled to stay in touch, broken again as the tide turned and normal business resumed for the Swiss great. Fucsovics, who was attempting to become the first player from his country to make the Melbourne quarters, was shellshocked as Federer turned on the style. He raced to a double break lead in the 3rd set with some brilliant passing shots and there was no way back for a player who came into the match in decent form, winning his 3 previous matches without dropping a set. Federer, who could face Djokovic in the semifinals if he gets past Sandgren, wrapped it up in two hours and 11 minutes, almost two hours less than his third-round epic against Millman. – Rappler.com "
538,250256,"January 26, 2020",Europe,Germany warns of 'mass exit' of Jews if hatred persists,Agence France-Presse,"Foreign Minister Heiko Maas says that Germany 'need to take urgent counter-measures to make sure that such thoughts do not turn into a bitter reality and lead to a massive departure of Jews'  MEMORIAL. Flowers and candles are seen at a door of the synagogue in Berlin, one day after the attack in Halle, eastern Germany, where two people were shot dead. File photo by Anton Roland/LAUB/AFP FRANKFURT, Germany – Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned Sunday, January 26, that Jews could leave Germany on a ""massive"" scale if urgent action was not taken to stem rising anti-Semitism. Writing in Der Spiegel weekly on the eve of the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, Maas said anti-Jewish insults and attacks, in real life and online, had become ""a daily occurrence."" Almost one in two Jews has considered leaving Germany, he said, a country that has long taken pains to confront its Nazi past. ""We need to take urgent counter-measures to make sure that such thoughts do not turn into a bitter reality and lead to a massive departure of Jews from Germany,"" he wrote. The fight against anti-Semitism would be a priority when Germany takes over the rotating EU presidency in July and the chairmanship of the Council of Europe, the bloc's leading human rights body, in November, Maas vowed. Germany will push for tougher legal consequences for anti-Semitic acts, he said, and for more EU nations to make Holocaust denial a crime – currently illegal in over a dozen member states including Germany, Belgium and Italy. Berlin will also step up the battle against anti-Jewish hate speech and disinformation on social media, Maas wrote, saying perpetrators ""should feel the full force of the law across Europe."" An anti-Semitic attack in the eastern German city of Halle in October – in which a gunman tried but failed to storm a synagogue before killing a passer-by and a customer at a kebab shop – showed that ""Jewish sites and communities"" needed better protection ""everywhere in Europe."" To help make that happen, Germany will contribute 500,000 euros ($550,000) to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) this year, Maas said. School trips The diplomat stressed the importance of educating young people about the horrors of World War II, when 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis. Research had shown that ""a third of young Europeans indicated knowing little to nothing about the Holocaust,"" he said. The comments came on the same day a YouGov survey found 56% of Germans were in favor of making a school visit to a concentration camp mandatory. Elderly Holocaust survivors will gather in Auschwitz on Monday to mark 75 years since Soviet troops liberated the camp, while world leaders held a sombre remembrance ceremony in Jerusalem last Thursday. More than 1.1 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Most died in the  gas chambers but many also succumbed to starvation, disease and overwork. – Rappler.com "

Residents of Barangay Wawa Ilaya in Lemery, Batangas, clean their houses as soon as they come home on January 26, 2020. Photo by Vee Salazar/Rappler BATANGAS, Philippines – Some evacuees were finally able to return to their homes on Sunday, January 26, as state volcanologists lowered Taal Volcano's status to Alert Level 3. Though the threat of a hazardous eruption is not yet being ruled out, the downgrading was a chance for families to check on what they left behind. Returning was easier for those with vehicles. ""Dineclare naman 'yan sa TV pero pansamantala lang dahil baka 'di raw...sigurado ng [Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology] kung puputok ba o hindi. Eh di kami nagdesisyon na ring pamilya na umuwi muna kami. Lilinisin ko muna ito,"" said Ramuel de Claro, a resident of Lemery. (It was announced on TV, that's the situation for now since Phivolcs can't say for certain if the volcano will erupt or not. So my family decided to come home. I'll clean here first.) De Claro and his family returned to a house with volcanic ash everywhere. They started to clean the walls and the street outside their house. But the amount of ash on their roof was just too much for them to clean in one day. The Batangas provincial government said residents may choose to come home if their area is no longer on lockdown, but evacuation centers are still open for those whose houses were damaged. Rappler went around the previously locked down areas within the 14-kilometer danger zone and saw that only a few residents had gone home. The areas still looked like a ghost town, particularly Talisay. De Claro, who stayed at his daughter's house in Makati City, said his family who came with him to Lemery left him by evening. He'll be alone in their Lemery home until state volcanologists declare that Taal Volcano will no longer erupt. What would he do if Alert Level 4 is raised again? ""Tatakbo. Ay, patigasan na lang ng dibdib. Wala na tayong magagawa,"" said De Claro. (I'll run. I just need to be brave. There's nothing we can do about the eruption.) Meanwhile, Mataasnakahoy residents got excited the moment they heard about the lowering of the alert level. ""Nakakainip na nakakapagod maghintay na makauwi. Parang kayo'y pagod na pagod kahit nakaupo lang.... Kaya nung sinabing makakauwi na, ang sarap ng feeling!"" said a resident who refused to be named. (It's boring and it's tiring to wait to be able to come home. It's like being so tired even if you're not doing anything.... That's why when they said we could return home, it felt so good!) Melisia Manalo, 63, is among the Mataasnakahoy residents who went home on Sunday. Her family used to live on the volcano island in the 1970s – the last time Taal erupted before its 2020 unrest. Should the alert level be raised again, Manalo said they will immediately gather their things to evacuate anew. ""Hindi matigas ang aming ulo dahil kaligtasan po ang habol namin,"" she said. (We won't be hardheaded because we want to be safe.) Government service The municipality of Taal, meanwhile, provided government vehicles to fetch residents.  Rommel Capuno, 32, said they started cleaning the classroom they were staying in at Banaba East Elementary School in Batangas City the moment they heard the news. ""Nung nalaman naming pwede nang bumalik kami po'y agad nag-ayos ng mga gamit. At saka tuwang-tuwa po ang aming mga kababayan na taga-rito at nababa na nga 'yung [alert level], at nag-open na 'yung lockdown,"" Capuno said. (When we learned that we could come home, we immediately fixed our things. People from our town were also very happy that the alert level has been lowered and there's no more lockdown.) Capuno said there were trucks from police in Canlubang City, Laguna, that brought the residents in batches to the Taal municipal hall. From there, vehicles from the municipal government brought them to their houses. Taal Mayor Fulgencio Mercado said the municipality borrowed vehicles from other local government units to augment theirs. According to Mercado, evacuation for their town came as a ""shock,"" as Taal had always been hosting evacuees. They weren't used to fleeing, and because of that, it took them 3 days to evacuate residents who were unwilling to leave the town. If the volcanic unrest escalates again, Mercado said evacuation may be faster the next time around. ""Siguro naman mas mabilis na ngayon, kasi before talaga nabulaga kami,"" the Taal mayor said. (I think it would be faster next time. Before, we were really shocked.) Still on lockdown At least 11 towns had been placed on total lockdown when Alert Level 4 was raised over Taal. Now, with a smaller danger zone of 7 kilometers from the main crater, only Taal Volcano Island, Agoncillo, and Laurel remain on lockdown. But Laurel residents have been given window hours of 11 am to 5 pm. (READ: LIST: Batangas towns, cities where lockdowns are lifted as Taal down to Alert Level 3) According to Laurel police manning a checkpoint, only the barangays of Gulod and Buso-Buso are highly vulnerable. Gulod, they said, is prone to landslides, while Buso-Buso is nearest to the volcano. On Sunday, Gulod resident Bonifacio Cortez traveled to their home from Alfonso, Cavite, where their evacuation center is located. He said he can't let their animals die. ""Kaya po kami nauwi dahil po ang aming alagang hayop, sayang naman po. Kung mamatay man ay wala naman pong mananagot do'n, eh di kung kami din lang po,"" Cortez said. (We came home because we need to take care of our animals. If they die, no one else would be responsible for that but us.) Cortez couldn't be bothered even if their house stands within the 7-kilometer danger zone. ""Kami po ay okay lang po kahit nandito lang po kami dahil wala naman pong pagyanig o mahina naman po ang lindol,"" he said. (We're fine even if we're staying here within the danger zone because we don't feel any earthquakes, or if we do, they're just weak.) Thousands of homes, however, may have been damaged in the past two weeks, according to Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas. The extent of the damage will still be assessed. Phivolcs has cautioned that now is not yet the time to relax, since the Taal unrest is not completely over. The volcano started erupting on January 12 and the situation rapidly progressed, catching even state volcanologists by surprise. – with a report from Tina Ganzon-Ozaeta/Rappler.com "

Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images/AFP LOS ANGELES, USA – Hollywood's directors handed World War I thriller 1917 their top annual prize Saturday, January 25 one of the final major award shows that typically spells success at next month's Oscars. The win makes British auteur Sam Mendes hot favorite for the best director Oscar – the Directors Guild of America Awards have correctly predicted the victor the past 6 years running. The movie, which follows two British soldiers on a perilous mission across no man's land, has already scooped the Golden Globe for best drama, and has 10 Oscar nominations. Mendes praised the work of fellow nominees Martin Scorsese (The Irishman), Quentin Tarantino (Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood), Bong Joon-ho (Parasite),  and Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit.) ""To those who kick dirt on the grave of the movies – not so fast,"" he said, dedicating the win to his grandfather, whose life inspired the film. ""I know it sounds a bit loopy but I did feel he was with us in a couple of occasions when I was struggling,"" said Mendes. Victory also boosts the film's frontrunner status for the best picture Academy Award. The win comes more than two decades after Mendes first received the DGA award for American Beauty, a victory that led to Oscars wins for that film. Mendes told AFP his first win had been ""frightening to be pitched into this sort of frenzy,"" adding: ""I'm 20 years older and I'm probably a little less scared."" The film's two lead actors paid tribute to Mendes. ""He's a master of so many mediums... he's pretty much done it all,"" said George MacKay. ""We'll be very excited to see what happens at the Oscars – I've never been before!"" his co-star Dean-Charles Chapman told AFP.  'New voices' A-list presenters at the glamorous downtown Los Angeles event Saturday included Al Pacino, Leonardo DiCaprio and Alfonso Cuaron, with Judd Apatow returning as host. Like the Oscars, the DGAs were criticized this year for excluding women from the top prize shortlist. DGA president Thomas Schlamme said the movie industry ""still have a lot of work to do"" on boosting diversity but pointed to the recently introduced first-time director category, featuring three women. Alma Har'el (Honey Boy) won the prize, praising fellow female nominees Mati Diop (Atlantics) and Melina Matsoukas (Queen & Slim) as ""the future."" The category means ""new voices like us can be included and celebrated,"" said Har'el, voicing support for a campaign to assist new mothers in the movie industry. Around 50 Hollywood women including Amy Schumer, Amy Poehler, and Greta Gerwig recently co-signed a letter stating women ""are penalized for having children in a way that their male counterparts are not.""  'Zeitgeist film' American Factory, a film about a US Rust Belt factory reopened by a Chinese billionaire, and which was produced by the Obamas, won best documentary. ""When we started (the film), we didn't have President Trump even, let alone trade wars and the conflict with China,"" director Julia Reichert told AFP. ""I think we're kind of a zeitgeist film."" The DGAs also honor television – Bill Hader won for directing dark hitman comedy Barry, in which he also stars, while the limited series prize went to Chernobyl. Superhero series Watchmen won the drama prize, seeing off an all-HBO shortlist including the much-maligned final season of ""Game of Thrones."" Although lower key than the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild awards, the DGAs are longer-running and offer prestigious recognition from 18,000 voters including top directors. ""To be nominated alongside these absolute legends is very surreal for me,"" Waititi told AFP. ""I am amongst the greats right now."" The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on February 9. – Rappler.com  "

With the loss, the Philippine team blew its chances on seizing the top spot and instead fell to 3rd place with a 6-4 record. Mono, meanwhile, moved further away from the pack with a 9-3 slate. Off a small 31-34 deficit midway through the 2nd quarter, the Thailand-based powerhouse erupted with an 18-5 run, capped by a Moses Morgan triple with 36 seconds left for a 16-point lead, 52-36. Mono kept the pressure up until the 2:53 mark of the 3rd frame, when Alab newcomer Prince Williams sliced the deficit to 57-62 after a pull-up trey that capped a 9-0 run. Unfazed, top Mono import Mike Singletary took matters into his own hands and slowed the pace down with 6 straight free throws to end the quarter with a 73-65 advantage. Alab had its moments in the final frame, but never got closer than 7 points as the visiting squad regained its double digit lead in the final minutes of regulation. Williams led the losing effort for Alab with 23 points in just his second game with the team, while Sam Deguara chipped in an 18-point, 10-rebound double-double. Singletary and Michael Morrison, meanwhile, led the balanced attack with 23 markers apiece in dominant road win. ""I thought we put ourselves in a hole early in the 1st quarter,"" said head coach Jimmy Alapag. ""I thought we made a run in the 3rd quarter when we had them on their heels a bit, but we fouled too much.

Only 38,000 of the 140,000 Jews who lived in the Netherlands survived World War II, but no government apology has been offered for the role the authorities played. The question of an apology was raised in 2012 when Rutte was also prime minister, but he said not enough information was available about government action during the war and that there was ""not broad enough support"" for an official apology. In 2000, then prime minister Wim Kok apologised for the ""icy welcome"" Nazi camp survivors received on their return to the Netherlands, which the Nazis occupied from 1940-1945. ""Our government institutions did not act as guardians of justice and security,"" Rutte said Sunday. ""Too many civil servants carried out the orders of the occupiers. ""The bitter consequences of the drawing up of registers (of Jews) and of the expulsions have not been adequately recognised, nor recognised in time"" Rutte added.

Hong Kong has declared the virus that first began in central China as a public ""emergency"" – the city's highest warning tier – and on Saturday announced ramped-up measures to reduce the risk of further infections. Among them was a plan to turn a newly built but currently empty public housing block in Fanling into a quarantine facility. The buildings would be used to house people who may have come into contact with carriers of the virus as they wait to get tested, as well as frontline medical staff worried about infecting their families. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The city has diagnosed 6 positive cases of the virus so far. Dozens of local residents and protesters opposed to the idea held rallies outside the complex on Sunday, with some setting up road blocks. In the evening, police said assailants threw petrol bombs at the buildings. An Agence France-Presse photographer on the scene saw fierce flames coming from the entrance of two apartment blocks before firefighters got the blaze under control. Riot police were on scene and protesters had left, although some local residents were arguing with officers who used pepper spray. The Centre for Health Protection said the plan to turn the housing estate into a quarantine zone would be suspended. The agency has already turned a holiday park in an isolated rural area into a working quarantine facility. Two other holiday parks located away from major housing estates are also ready to be used as similar facilities. But officials say they have struggled to find hotels and spare rooms for doctors and nurses working on the isolation wards where patients are being treated. The virus outbreak comes at a time when Hong Kong is already boiling with widespread anti-government sentiment after seven months of often violent pro-democracy protests. The city's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam boasts record-low approval ratings while the police force is loathed in many neighbourhoods. The frequency and ferocity of protests have died down in the last six weeks, but sporadic clashes still take place. Police fired tear gas on Saturday night – the first day of the Lunar New Year – at small groups of masked protesters in Mongkok. Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth. The city's ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers. Animosity towards China has intensified in recent years as Beijing tightens political control over the semi-autonomous territory and as mainlanders compete with locals for jobs, property and goods in the pricey city. – Rappler.com "

Kobe Bryant spent all of his 20 seasons in the NBA with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping the franchise win 5 championships. Photo by Harry How/Getty Images/AFP LOS ANGELES, USA (UPDATED) – NBA legend Kobe Bryant died on Sunday, January 26 when a helicopter he was riding in crashed and burst into flames in thick fog, killing all 9 people on board including his teenage daughter and plunging legions of fans around the world into mourning. Bryant, 41, was traveling with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and 7 other passengers and crew when their Sikorsky S-76 helicopter slammed into a rugged hillside in Calabasas, west of Los Angeles. There were no survivors. Bryant, a 5-time NBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist, is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in history, an iconic figure who became one of the faces of his sport during a glittering two-decade career with the Los Angeles Lakers. Dozens of firefighters and paramedics battled across steep terrain to reach the flaming wreckage at the crash site but found no survivors, officials said. The National Transportation Safety Board said an 18-strong team of investigators would be sent to California to probe the causes of the crash. The incident came only hours after Bryant was eclipsed by current Lakers star LeBron James for No. 3 on the all-time NBA scoring list. Bryant's final post on social media had been a tweet congratulating James on surpassing him. Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother  #33644— Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) January 26, 2020 Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother  #33644 Drafted out of high school, Bryant spent all of his 20 NBA seasons with the Lakers and helped the storied franchise win 5 championships. He also captured two Olympic gold medals with Team USA in the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Games. The man called as the ""Black Mamba"" won an NBA Most Valuable Player plum in 2008 and was included to the All-NBA First Team and NBA All-Defensive First Team for 11 and 9 times, respectively. Bryant bowed out of the NBA in 2016, scoring 60 points in his final appearance before his adoring fans at the Staples Center. It was a fairytale farewell to a sporting career which had begun two decades earlier. The son of former NBA player Joe ""Jellybean"" Bryant, the Lakers legend was born in Philadelphia in 1978 while his father played for the 76ers. The elder Bryant played from 1984 to 1991 in Italy, giving young Kobe a global worldview as he grew up dreaming of following his dad into the NBA. When his father retired as a player, the family moved back to the Philadelphia area and the younger Bryant began his star turn at the Lower Merion High School, where his jersey No. 33 was retired. He decided at age 17 to jump directly from the prep ranks to the NBA, only the sixth player and first guard to make such a leap. Bryant was selected 13th overall by the Charlotte Hornets in the 1996 NBA Draft but they were picking for the Lakers in a deal made before the draft. At 18, Bryant became, at the time, the youngest player or starter in an NBA game and the youngest winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. In 1998, he became the youngest NBA All-Star starter, and in the following year, started every game for the Lakers and signed a six-year deal worth $70 million. As the Michael Jordan era ended in Chicago, Bulls coach Phil Jackson wound up joining the Lakers and Bryant. With Bryant forming a formidable duo with dominating inside force Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers captured 3 NBA crowns in a row from 2000 to 2002, returning the team to glory days unseen since 1988. He remained with the franchise for the remainder of his career, successfully branching out into the entertainment industry following his retirement. In 2018, he won an Oscar for his animated short film ""Dear Basketball,"" a love letter to the sport which brought him fame and fortune. – Rappler.com "

552,250270,"January 27, 2020",#AnimatED,[EDITORIAL] Our biggest enemy amid the Wuhan virus outbreak,Rappler.com,"It’s not the virus. It’s not the Chinese flying into the Philippines. It’s panic. Here's the situation: a new strain of the coronavirus has caused an outbreak in the city of Wuhan in central China. It has so far killed 80 people and infected more than 2,700. While the entire province of Hubei is on lockdown, the virus has nevertheless been transmitted by infected humans to at least 12 other countries. The Philippines is awaiting confirmation if the virus has reached its shores. So far, the only case acknowledged by the Department of Health (DOH) to be under observation is a 5-year-old boy from Wuhan who was isolated in a hospital in Cebu City starting January 12, and has since been discharged. While the boy has exhibited flu-like symptoms, there’s no certainty yet that what he has is the newly-discovered 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV), also called the Wuhan virus. It could be any of the 7 known coronaviruses. Health authorities are awaiting the results of lab tests done on the boy’s samples in Australia. The Bureau of Immigration has tracked down the family of 4 whose father, after traveling from Wuhan to Hong Kong, has been found to be “preliminary positive” with the virus. Leaving the patient in HK, the family boarded a Cebu Pacific flight to Manila on January 22. The justice department says it is monitoring the movements of that family, and “may refer them to Bureau of Quarantine” (BOQ). The airline urged the passengers of that flight 5J 111 to get themselves checked. On Monday morning, January 27, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a Malacañang briefing that the DOH was investigating 11 possible nCov cases in 6 regions in the country, but reiterated that there is no confirmed case yet. Without any confirmation from health authorities, the rest of the supposed cases we’ve been reading about on social media are speculations or outright misinformation.   Understandably, Filipinos are worried. The 2019 nCov, which can infect a person’s airways, has symptoms similar to the deadly SARS-CoV of 17 years ago, and can be transferred from human to human. And while scientists have yet to understand the new virus’ life cycle, how exactly it’s transmitted, and whether it is going to mutate, there is no approved vaccine or treatment yet for the coronavirus infection. But we should caution ourselves against letting this worry spiral into panic. Because panic can blur our judgment. It makes us vulnerable to wrong information or speculation or conspiracy theories. It makes us discriminate against any person “who looks Chinese” and is wearing a mask, or is in the vicinity of a hospital. It makes us question the specialists in the health department when they don’t seem to be as worried as we are. We nag our local governments to do drastic things that are outside the protocols established by the DOH. We’ve heard of Chinese-looking individuals not being allowed to enter the emergency room of a hospital – a nurse had to talk to them outside, and then they were turned away. In one city, we heard that some journalists were among those pushing the mayor to declare a total ban on Chinese tourists. Some have made racist remarks about what the Chinese in the mainland eat. Let’s go back to what authorities say we know about the Wuhan virus, and stick to that. Arnaud Fontanet, head of the department of epidemiology at Institut Pasteur in Paris, says the 2019 nCov, in its current form, appears to be “weaker” than SARS. It’s too early to say whether the virus is going to mutate or not. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the country representative to the Philippines of the World Health Organization (WHO), said as of January 21 that it was “too early to say this is a severe disease.” So far, those who have died had pre-existing illnesses, while not all of them had a history of getting in contact with the wet market in Wuhan where wild animals being sold were suspected to have been the source of the virus. Through the WHO, China’s health ministry is expected to provide the Philippines and other countries a DNA sample of the 2019 nCoV. This “will serve as the basis for our own testing and treatment” via the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, says Secretary Duque. Duque says the Philippines’ “detection capability is still evolving,” but this should not be a handicap. Thanks to the internet, scientists from universities, research centers, and even private companies across the globe are collaborating online to study the Wuhan virus so China and other countries can all respond to it appropriately. So far, the Philippines has suspended all direct flights to and from Wuhan, and has put its Bureau of Quarantine at the airports on high alert. The DOH assures the public that it is ready in case the Wuhan virus reaches the Philippines, and this confidence stems from the fact that, since the 2003 SARS crisis, protocols on monitoring and testing are in place, and surveillance units are in place in the regions, cascading information and instructions down to the barangays.

553,250271,"January 27, 2020",Middle East,3 rockets hit U.S. embassy in protest-hit Iraqi capital,Agence France-Presse,"One rocket hit an embassy cafeteria at dinner time while two others landed nearby, a security source says  SMOKE. Iraqi protesters react amid tear gas amid clashes with security forces following an anti-government demonstration in Al-Khilani square in the capital Baghdad, on January 26, 2020. Photo by Ahmad Al-Rubaye/AFP BAGHDAD, Iraq – Three rockets slammed into the US embassy in Iraq's capital on Sunday, January 26 in the first direct hit reported after months of close calls, as thousands kept up anti-government sit-ins across the country. The attack marked a dangerous escalation in the spree of rocket attacks in recent months that have targeted the embassy or Iraqi military bases where American troops are deployed. None of the attacks has been claimed but Washington has repeatedly blamed Iran-backed military factions in Iraq. On Sunday, one rocket hit an embassy cafeteria at dinner time while two others landed nearby, a security source told AFP. A senior Iraqi official told AFP at least one person was wounded, but it was not immediately clear how serious the injuries were and whether the person was an American national or an Iraqi staff member working at the mission. The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The attack took place earlier in the day than usual, with AFP reporters hearing the booms on the western bank of the river Tigris at precisely 7:30 pm (1630 GMT). Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and Speaker of Parliament Mohammed Halbusi both condemned the incident, saying it risked dragging their homeland into war. Iraq has already been dragged into a worrying tit-for-tat between the United States and Iran over the last month. A similar attack on a northern Iraqi base killed an American contractor, and the US retaliated with a strike on an Iran-backed faction known as Kataeb Hezbollah. Less than a week later, a US drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi military figure Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis outside the Baghdad airport – prompting Iran to fire ballistic missiles at an Iraqi base where US troops are stationed. 'Only for you, Iraq!' Some 5,200 Americans are stationed in Iraq to lead the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, but the US strike on Baghdad has rallied top Iraqi figures around a joint call to order them out. Vehemently anti-American cleric Moqtada Sadr organised a mass rally in Baghdad on Friday, where thousands of his supporters called for American troops to leave. Sadr had previously backed separate anti-regime protests sweeping Iraq's capital and south, even though he controls the largest bloc in parliament and top ministerial posts. Bolstered by his own protest on Friday, Sadr announced he was dropping support for the youth-dominated reform campaign rocking the country since October. His followers, widely regarded as the best-organized and well-stocked of the anti-government demonstrators, immediately began dismantling their tents and heading home. Activists feared that without his political cover, authorities would move to crush their movement – and indeed, within hours, riot police tried to storm protest camps across the capital and south. Those efforts continued into Sunday, with security forces using live rounds and tear gas to try to flush protesters out of squares and streets they had occupied for months. One protester was shot dead in Baghdad and another in the flashpoint southern city of Nasiriyah, medical sources said, and dozens more were wounded across the country. In the capital, riot police have tried to clear streets around the main protest camp of Tahrir Square but have yet to enter the symbolic area, where many protesters stood their ground even after tents there were dismantled. Just after midnight in Nasiriyah, unknown assailants stormed the main protest camp in Habbubi Square and set the tents on fire, the flames lighting up the night sky, an AFP correspondent there said. UN hails 'Iraqi hopes' Despite the renewed violence, thousands of students flooded the streets in the capital and across the south in a bid to keep national attention focused on their demands. ""Only for you, Iraq!"" read a sign held by a young protester in the shrine city of Karbala, hinting at the movement's insistence on not being affiliated with any political party or outside backer. In Basra, hundreds of students gathered to condemn the riot police's dismantling of their main protest camp the previous day, according to an AFP correspondent. The youth-led protests erupted on October 1 in outrage over lack of jobs, poor services and rampant corruption before spiralling into calls for a government overhaul after they were met with violence. More than 470 people have died, a vast majority of them demonstrators, since the rallies erupted. Protesters are now demanding snap elections, the appointment of an independent premier and the prosecution of anyone implicated in corruption or recent bloodshed. Their voices have been heard by top UN envoy in Iraq Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert who has said: ""Unaccountability and indecisiveness are unworthy of Iraqi hopes, courageously expressed for 4 months now."" ""While death and injury tolls continue to rise, steps taken so far will remain hollow if not completed,"" she said Saturday. – Rappler.com "

While there were no new deaths confirmed outside of Hubei, the national tally of verified infections rose by 769, around half of them in Hubei, the National Health Commission said. It said 461 of those infected were in serious condition. China has locked down Hubei in the country's center, an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people and intended to slow transmission of the respiratory virus. The previously unknown contagion has caused global concern because of its similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pathogen, which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. (READ: New China virus 'not as powerful as SARS' – health official) Drastic travel restrictions have been imposed outside the epicenter, with Shandong province and 4 cities – Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and Tianjin – announcing bans on long-distance buses entering or leaving. The move will affect millions of people travelling over the Lunar New Year holiday, which authorities said would be extended while the government works to contain the virus. The populous southern province of Guangdong, Jiangxi in central China, and 3 cities made it mandatory for residents to wear face masks in public. Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and across the world – with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries including as far away as the United States. – Rappler.com "

562,250280,"January 27, 2020",Thought Leaders,"[OPINION] Duterte is a mass murderer, but I support his terminating the VFA",Walden Bello,"'Here goes that knee-jerk anti-Americanism again, some folks may say. But really, entering these two agreements were two of the most irresponsible foreign policy decisions made by our heads of state,' writes Walden Bello    President Rodrigo Duterte is, in my view, a mass murderer, but I would support his move to terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the United States. The man may be the devil incarnate but, hey, I won’t quibble about his motives. Here goes that knee-jerk anti-Americanism again, some folks may say. But really, entering these two agreements were two of the most irresponsible foreign policy decisions made by our heads of state – Joseph Estrada in the case of the VFA, and Benigno Aquino III in that of EDCA. Indeed, one of the reasons I broke with Aquino and resigned from Congress in 2015 was his succumbing to US pressure to ensnare us into EDCA. Coming into force almost a decade after the Americans gave up Subic and Clark, the VFA reflected the US’s move from a position of regarding China as a “strategic partner” under the Clinton administration in late 1990’s to its defining Beijing a “strategic rival” under George W. Bush in the early 2000’s. (READ: DOJ: Effects of VFA termination on EDCA, Mutual Defense Treaty have to be studied) What made the Pentagon change its mind? It was China’s major push to improve its missile defense emplacements on its long southeastern and eastern coastline and in the East and South China Seas, following Beijing’s realization of how vulnerable to US attack its coastal urban industrial infrastructure was when Washington sent two carrier task forces to the region to intimidate China during the Taiwan Straits Crisis in 1996. Over the next few years, the Pentagon carried out an aggressive upgrading of its capabilities to penetrate China’s improving anti-ship and anti-missile defensive shield (A2/AD) in the area. The result was the institutionalization of a warfighting doctrine focused on China: the AirSea Battle Strategy. According to the most important elaboration of AirSea Battle, its aim was “to overcome China’s A2/AD defenses” because failure to do so would result in the “United States [finding] itself effectively locked out of a region that has been declared a vital security interest by every administration in the last 60 years.” Key to AirSea Doctrine was obtaining bases in the Philippines to provide fire and logistical support to American air and naval efforts to swamp Chinese coastal and island defenses. Concluded with the Obama administration in 2014, EDCA can be described as nothing less than a gift to Washington. It allowed the US to set up military bases for troops and war materiel in nominally Philippine bases. And Washington could have these bases without paying rent – the sticking point in the 1990-91 base renegotiations! (READ: [ANALYSIS] Despite Duterte rhetoric, US military gains forward base in PH) But what was worrisome was not only that we were making a major cession of our sovereignty, but geopolitically and geographically, we were caught in the worst of all worlds. The bases here would serve as one of the springboards for a US offensive to overcome China’s A2/AD defenses on its coasts and the West Philippine Sea. At the same time, they would be within range of intermediate range Chinese missiles in the event of a conflict. Aquino enlisted us in a dangerous military alliance against China without a formal alliance! We had stupidly allowed ourselves to be suckered into a runaway arms and strategic race on the side of the United States, and, as I pointed out to Aquino’s advisers at the time, EDCA undermined the legal and moral case we had against Beijing’s island grab in the West Philippine Sea. (READ: Lorenzana says it’s within PH right to scrap defense pact with US) Under the Trump and Duterte administrations, the situation of the Philippines has gotten worse. Trump has taken the US out of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) and his Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has made it clear that Washington will now set up intermediate range nuclear missile emplacements directed at China in the Western Pacific. It is not unlikely that the Philippine bases are being considered to serve as hosts for these weapons systems. Duterte, for his part, has rhetorically inveighed against the United States, but he has done absolutely nothing so far to interrupt the flow of US troops and war materiel in the country. Washington is willing to put up with his curses, so long as he does nothing to limit the freedom of action that his predecessor Aquino, a man devoid of any strategic sense, gave the US. So, yes, I support the president’s expressed intention to withdraw from the VFA and would urge him to also include leaving EDCA and that useless relic of the Cold War, the Mutual Defense Treaty. The big question is: will he follow through, defying both his generals and their real boss – the Pentagon? This man is, as I said, a mass murderer, and I will continue to hold him accountable for his violations of human rights. But when it comes to ending VFA and EDCA, he can count on my support. – Rappler.com Walden Bello served in the House of Representatives from 2009 to 2015, during which he authored the House Resolution renaming the South China Sea the West Philippine Sea as well as opposed the Aquino administration’s entering the Enhanced Defense Cooperation with the United States.  He made the only recorded resignation on principle in the history of Congress in March 2015.  "

French residents in Wuhan speak during an interview with AFP about the possibility of being evacuated from Wuhan on January 26, 2020. Photo by Hector Retamal/AFP WUHAN, China – Anxious foreigners in the locked-down city that spawned China's deadly viral epidemic say they are stranded at home, running out of food, and desperate to leave, as governments scrambled to draw up evacuation plans. Authorities have barred travel to and from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected before it spread across China and to a dozen other countries – including the United States, France, and Australia. Several other large cities in China have introduced their own travel restrictions in a bid to contain the disease, which has killed 56 people and infected nearly 2,000 others. ""In the past week we've not been able to go out and buy anything to eat,"" said Mashal Jamalzai, a political science student from Afghanistan at Central China Normal University. He told AFP that he and his classmates had been living on biscuits, and his embassy had not responded to requests for help. ""We want to be evacuated as soon as possible, because either the virus, the hunger or the fear will kill us,"" Jamalzai said. Thousands of foreign students and other international residents live in Wuhan, a normally bustling transport hub in central China home to a huge steel and auto industry. But with schools, hospitals and public offices shut and no transport to and from the city, Hubei University student Siti Mawaddah says the city now ""looks like a ghost town."" ""The situation in Wuhan right now is very intense and worrying,"" the 25-year-old Indonesian told AFP, adding that the situation had taken a psychological toll on her and her classmates. ""If we stay in Wuhan, it's as if we're just waiting for our turn to get infected,"" she said. Mawaddah said she had heard the United States plans to evacuate consular staff and some American citizens living in the city, and hoped her own government could do the same. Evacuation plans The US State Department is sending a flight to collect its consular staff and carry them to San Francisco, but warned that there would only be limited space for the estimated 1,000 Americans living in Wuhan. ""If there is insufficient ability to transport everyone who expresses interest, priority will be given to individuals at greater risk from coronavirus,"" the department said. Diana Adama, an American teacher living in Wuhan, told CNN that she was upset at the lack of information about the virus. But she said she didn't want to leave on the chartered flight if it meant carrying the virus back home. ""I'm not going to endanger anybody else. And that's just erring on the side of caution,"" she told the broadcaster. France is also planning to evacuate its citizens stuck in Hubei province by bus, and French carmaker PSA – which has a sizable presence in Wuhan – said was formulating plans to evacuate staff and relatives for quarantine in a neighbouring province. South Korea's consulate general in Wuhan conducted a poll on Sunday to determine the demand for a chartered plane for its citizens who want to return home, while Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his country would fly out any nationals who wanted to leave. Singapore has already repatriated 20 airline staff and passengers who were quarantined in the eastern city of Hangzhou for more than a day after fears one person on the flight was carrying the disease, according to the Straits Times newspaper. And Sri Lanka said Sunday it would fly back 150 students from China in the next two days. With China ramping up travel restrictions in cities across the country – including Beijing and Shanghai – foreign countries have told their citizens to avoid Wuhan. Russia has yet to report its first case of the virus but has gone a step further, with tourism officials on Friday asking operators to stop selling tour packages to China and inform customers about the dangers of the outbreak. Tourism company Rus-Tour announced Sunday it was transporting 1,100 of its customers home from Hainan, a resort island popular with Russian travellers around 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) south of Wuhan. The firm was also halting sales of tours to China ""until the epidemiological situation in the country is back to normal,"" it said in a statement. – Rappler.com "

Residents enter the town of Lemery, Batangas after they were allowed to return to their homes following the lowering of the Taal Volcano alert level from 4 to 3 on Sunday, January 26. Photo by AFP MANILA, Philippines – It was a bittersweet feeling that residents had coming home to ash-ridden houses and starving pets that were forced to abandon following the sudden eruption of the Taal Volcano on January 12. After two weeks of uncertainty, several Batangueño evacuees finally returned to their homes Sunday morning, January 26, immediately after the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) downgraded the Taal Volcano from Alert Level 4 to Alert Level 3. The Batangas provincial government lifted lockdowns it earlier imposed on 12 cities and municipalities located within the volcano's 14-km danger zone. Residents from these areas were given the option to either return to their homes or stay in evacuation centers, said Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas in a media briefing. ""Nakakainip na nakakapagod maghintay na makauwi. Parang kayo'y pagod na pagod kahit nakaupo lang.... Kaya nung sinabing makakauwi na, ang sarap ng feeling!"" said a resident, who refused to be named. (It's boring and it's tiring to be waiting to go home. You're exhausted even if you're not doing anything.... That's why when they said we could return home, it felt so good!) Coming home did not automatically put an end to their difficulties. Returning residents face the daunting task of removing the thick blanket of ash that has covered their neighborhood. They have to attend to household pets and livestock that they had to abandon in their rush to flee when the eruption started. (READ: How groups are saving stranded animals near Taal Volcano) ""Kaya po kami nauwi dahil po ang aming alagang hayop, sayang naman po. Kung mamatay man ay wala naman pong mananagot do'n, eh di kung kami din lang po,"" Gulod resident Bonifacio Cortez said. (We would come home because we need to take care of our animals. If they die, no one else would be responsible for that but us.) The threat of a hazardous eruption remains. Phivolcs warned returning residents to prepare for a quick and organized evacuation if the alert level rises again. This is something 63-year-old Melisia Manalo understood completely. In case a hazardous eruption occurs while they're home, she said they would be more prepared. “Kami ho’y mag-iipon ulit ng gamit at aahon ho ulit kami. Hindi matigas ang aming ulo dahil kaligtasan po ang habol namin,” Manalo added. (We will gather our possessions and evacuate again. We are not stubborn, we also want to prioritize our safety) Despite the constant threat and cleaning up that needs to be done, many residents simply relish the semblance of normalcy that being home lends them.

Photo by Francis Specker/EPA-EFE MANILA, Philippines – Many legends have come and gone with the Los Angeles Lakers, but it will always be a valid argument that it has been Kobe Bryant’s team as the years went by. Which is why after his shocking death on Sunday, January 26 (Monday, January 27, Philippine time), numerous pillars of the purple and gold gave fitting tributes fit for a future Hall of Famer and a generational icon of basketball. One of these legends is none other than Bryant’s partner-in-crime during their NBA title three-peat from 2000 to 2002: Shaquille O’Neal.  There’s no words to express the pain Im going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother @kobebryant I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW pic.twitter.com/pigHywq3c1  Kobe was so much more than an athlete, he was a family man. That was what we had most in common. I would hug his children like they were my own and he would embrace my kids like they were his. His baby girl Gigi was born on the same day as my youngest daughter Me’Arah. pic.twitter.com/BHBPN5Wq8V  Despite some heated feuds in the early years of their controversial fallout, the legendary duo eventually buried the hatchet as O’Neal even attended Bryant’s 60-point farewell game. Like O’Neal, fellow legendary Laker big man and NBA all-time leading scorer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar shared his thoughts on the Black Mamba’s tragic demise.   Most people will remember Kobe as the magnificent athlete who inspired a whole generation of basketball players. But I will always remember him as a man who was much more than an athlete. pic.twitter.com/9EZuwk8wrV  Abdul-Jabbar’s long-standing scoring record has yet to be broken by any other player in the league, and the nearest active star on pace to get there is another Laker hunting for banner number 17: LeBron James. In a grim coincidence, James was just fresh off beating Bryant’s own scoring record in his birth place of Philadelphia before the tragedy struck. And the Mamba’s last words online just happened to be about that historic feat.   Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother #33644  James was mid-air in the team’s flight back to Los Angeles when the news broke, and thus he only learned of the shocking development upon landing. “The King” has yet to say a word to the public regarding his good friend’s death, but judging by this video, no words needed to be said.   LeBron is met with emotional hugs after landing in Los Angeles following the death of Kobe Bryant.(via NBC4 Los Angeles) pic.twitter.com/Fx9jt2qZVi  Other Laker legends, meanwhile, had lots more to say on Bryant’s passing, with all-time great point guard Magic Johnson having the most detailed tributes on social media.   As I try to write this post, my mind is racing. I’m in disbelief and have been crying all morning over this devastating news that Kobe and his young daughter, Gigi have passed away in a helicopter crash. Cookie and I are heartbroken. pic.twitter.com/X2vF0M0a1u  My friend, a legend, husband, father, son, brother, Oscar winner and greatest Laker of all-time is gone. It’s hard to accept. Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players. pic.twitter.com/NXsrXmCkkG  He gave his knowledge, time, and talent to tutor so many at the youth level, collegiate level, & NBA & WNBA players. Words can’t express the impact that he had on the game of basketball. I know basketball fans all over the world will miss him, especially the City of Los Angeles. pic.twitter.com/ZoB3Uwbvzk  We love you forever. #8 #24  Bryant’s teammates over the years also expressed their shock at his sudden loss, including two-time champion Pau Gasol and longtime backcourt partner Derek Fisher.   Beyond devastated... my big brother... I can’t, I just can’t believe it  Struggling to process what is now a reality. Kobe’s life after basketball was just beginning and his second act was going to be even greater. His legacy, Gigi’s legacy both will live on forever!  Steve Nash and Metta World Peace also shared a few words reflecting on their short, but meaningful stint during Bryant’s twilight years in the league.  My heart is broken for Kobe and his family. I’ll never forget the battles but what I really admired was the father he was to his girls. Rest In Peace old friend with your angel Gianna  Metta World Peace reflects on former teammate Kobe Bryant: “I wish I could have spent more time.” https://t.co/JHEuAFMSA8 pic.twitter.com/pQdpcCkj65  Clearly, Bryant’s sudden death sent massive shockwaves even outside the reaches of the sporting world, but nothing could ever compare to the pain felt by those who shared his passion throughout the years with the purple and gold. The effects of his death will surely be felt for years to come, which only proves the kind of impact the Mamba had on the hardwood and beyond. – Rappler.com  "

A participant walks past a wall showing a quote by Indian pacifist Mahatma Gandhi at the UN Climate Change Conference COP25 at the 'IFEMA - Feria de Madrid' exhibition center in Madrid, December 13, 2019. Photo by Cristina Quicler/AFP The following is a speech delivered by Yuval Harari at the 2020 World Economic Forum Annual Meeting, in its session entitled 'How to Survive the 21st Century.'  As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, humanity faces so many issues and questions that it is really hard to know what to focus on. So I would like to use the next 20 minutes to help us focus of all the different issues we face. Three problems pose existential challenges to our species. These three existential challenges are nuclear war, ecological collapse, and technological disruption. We should focus on them.  The challenges we should focus on. Now, nuclear war and ecological collapse are already familiar threats, so let me spend some time explaining the less familiar threat posed by technological disruption. In Davos we hear so much about the enormous promises of technology – and these promises are certainly real. But technology might also disrupt human society and the very meaning of human life in numerous ways, ranging from the creation of a global useless class to the rise of data colonialism and of digital dictatorships.  Technology has the potential to be highly disruptive. First, we might face upheavals on the social and economic level. Automation will soon eliminate millions upon millions of jobs, and while new jobs will certainly be created, it is unclear whether people will be able to learn the necessary new skills fast enough. Suppose you are a 50-year-old truck driver, and you just lost your job to a self-driving vehicle. Now there are new jobs in designing software or in teaching yoga to engineers – but how does a 50-year-old truck driver reinvent himself or herself as a software engineer or as a yoga teacher? And people will have to do it not just once but again and again throughout their lives, because the automation revolution will not be a single watershed event, following which the job market will settle down into a new equilibrium. Rather, it will be a cascade of ever bigger disruptions, because AI is nowhere near its full potential. Old jobs will disappear, new jobs will emerge, but then the new jobs will rapidly change and vanish. Whereas in the past humans had to struggle against exploitation, in the 21st century the really big struggle will be against irrelevance. And it is much worse to be irrelevant than exploited.  Could automation create a 'useless class?' Those who fail in the struggle against irrelevance would constitute a new “useless class” – people who are useless not from the viewpoint of their friends and family, but useless from the viewpoint of the economic and political system. And this useless class will be separated by an ever-growing gap from the ever more powerful elite. The AI revolution might create unprecedented inequality not just between classes but also between countries. In the 19th century, a few countries like Britain and Japan industrialized first, and they went on to conquer and exploit most of the world. If we aren’t careful, the same thing will happen in the 21st century with AI. We are already in the midst of an AI arms race, with China and the USA leading the race, and most countries being left far, far behind. Unless we take action to distribute the benefit and power of AI between all humans, AI will likely create immense wealth in a few high-tech hubs, while other countries will either go bankrupt or become exploited data-colonies. Now we aren’t talking here about a science fiction scenario of robots rebelling against humans. We are talking about far more primitive AI, which is nevertheless enough to disrupt the global balance. Just think what will happen to developing economies once it is cheaper to produce textiles or cars in California than in Mexico? And what will happen to politics in your country in 20 years, when somebody in San Francisco or Beijing knows the entire medical and personal history of every politician, every judge, and every journalist in your country, including all their sexual escapades, all their mental weaknesses, and all their corrupt dealings? Will it still be an independent country or will it become a data-colony? When you have enough data, you don't need to send soldiers in order to control a country. Alongside inequality, the other major danger we face is the rise of digital dictatorships that will monitor everyone all the time.  Does the future hold a digital dictatorship? This danger can be stated in the form of a simple equation, which I think might be the defining equation of life in the 21st century: B x C x D = AHH! Which means: biological knowledge multiplied by computing power multiplied by data equals the ability to hack humans, ahh.  A dangerous equation. If you know enough biology and have enough computing power and data, you can hack my body and my brain and my life, and you can understand me better than I understand myself. You can know my personality type, my political views, my sexual preferences, my mental weaknesses, my deepest fears and hopes. You know more about me than I know about myself. And you can do that not just to me, but to everyone. A system that understands us better than we understand ourselves can predict our feelings and decisions, can manipulate our feelings and decisions, and can ultimately make decisions for us. Now, in the past, many governments and tyrants wanted to do it, but nobody understood biology well enough and nobody had enough computing power and data to hack millions of people. Neither the Gestapo nor the KGB could do it. But soon, at least some corporations and governments will be able to systematically hack all the people. We humans should get used to the idea that we are no longer mysterious souls – we are now hackable animals. That's what we are. The power to hack humans can be used for good purposes – like providing much better healthcare. But if this power falls into the hands of a 21st century Stalin, the result will be the worst totalitarian regime in human history. And we already have a number of applicants for the job of 21st century Stalin. Just imagine North Korea in 20 years, when everybody has to wear a biometric bracelet which constantly monitors your blood pressure, your heart rate, and your brain activity 24 hours a day. You listen to a speech on the radio by the great leader and they know what you actually feel. You can clap your hands and smile, but if you're angry, they know, you'll be in the gulag tomorrow. And if we allow the emergence of such total surveillance regimes, don’t think that the rich and powerful in places like Davos will be safe – just ask Jeff Bezos. In Stalin’s USSR, the state monitored members of the communist elite more than anyone else. The same will be true of future total surveillance regimes. The higher you are in the hierarchy – the more closely you’ll be watched. Do you want your CEO or your president to know what you really think about them? So it is in the interest of all humans, including the elites, to prevent the rise of such digital dictatorships. And in the meantime, if you get a suspicious WhatsApp message from some Prince, don't open it. Now if we indeed prevent the establishment of digital dictatorships, the ability to hack humans might still undermine the very meaning of human freedom. Because as humans will rely on AI to make more and more decisions for us, authority will shift from humans to algorithms, and this is already happening. Already today billions of people trust the Facebook algorithm to tell us what is new, the Google algorithm tells us what is true, Netflix tells us what to watch, and the Amazon and Alibaba algorithms tell us what to buy. In the not-so-distant future, similar algorithms might tell us where to work and who to marry, and also decide whether to hire us for a job, whether to give us a loan, and whether the central bank should raise the interest rate. And if you ask why you were not given a loan, and why you the bank didn't raise the interest rate the answer will always be the same – because the computer says no. And since the limited human brain lacks sufficient biological knowledge, computing power and data – humans will simply not be able to understand the computer’s decisions. So even in supposedly free countries, humans are likely to lose control over our own lives and also lose the ability to understand public policy. Already now how many humans understand the financial system? Maybe 1%, to be very generous. In a couple of decades, the number of humans capable of understanding the financial system will be exactly zero. Now we humans are used to thinking about life as a drama of decision-making. What will be the meaning of human life, when most decisions are taken by algorithms? We don’t even have philosophical models to understand such an exsistence.  For better or for worse? The usual bargain between philosophers and politicians is that philosophers have a lot of fanciful ideas, and politicians basically explain that they lack the means to implement these ideas. Now we are in an opposite situation. We are facing philosophical bankruptcy. The twin revolutions of infotech and biotech are now giving politicians the means to create heaven or hell, but the philosophers are having trouble conceptualizing what the new heaven and the new hell will look like. And that’s a very dangerous situation. If we fail to conceptualize the new heaven quickly enough, we might be easily misled by naïve utopias. And if we fail to conceptualize the new hell quickly enough, we might find ourselves entrapped there with no way out.  Will philosophy be able keep up with machines? Finally, technology might disrupt not just our economy, politics and philosophy – but also our biology. In the coming decades, AI and biotechnology will give us godlike abilities to reengineer life, and even to create completely new life-forms. After 4 billion years of organic life shaped by natural selection, we are about to enter a new era of inorganic life shaped by intelligent design. Our intelligent design is going to be the new driving force of the evolution of life and in using our new divine powers of creation we might make mistakes on a cosmic scale. In particular, governments, corporations and armies are likely to use technology to enhance human skills that they need – like intelligence and discipline – while neglecting other humans skills – like compassion, artistic sensitivity and spirituality. The result might be a race of humans who are very intelligent and very disciplined but lack compassion, lack artistic sensitivity, and lack spiritual depth. Of course, this is not a prophecy. These are just possibilities. Technology is never deterministic.  The future isn't set in stone. In the 20th century, people used the same industrial technology to build very different kinds of societies: fascist dictatorships, communist regimes, liberal democracies. The same thing will happen in the 21st century. AI and biotech will certainly transform the world, but we can use them to create very different kinds of societies. And if you're afraid of some of the possibilities I’ve mentioned, you can still do something about it. But to do something effective, we need global cooperation. All the 3 existential challenges we face are global problems that demand global solutions. Whenever a leader says something like “My country first!” we should remind that leader that no nation can prevent nuclear war or stop ecological collapse by itself, and no nation can regulate AI and bioengineering by itself.  Play at your own risk. Almost every country will say: “Hey, we don’t want to develop killer robots or to genetically engineer human babies. We are the good guys. But we can't trust our rivals not to do it. So we must do it first.” If we allow such an arms race to develop in fields like AI and bioengineering, it doesn’t really matter who wins the arms race – the loser will be humanity.  Game over. Unfortunately, just when global cooperation is more needed than ever before, some of the most powerful leaders and countries in the world are now deliberately undermining global cooperation. Leaders like the US president tell us that there is an inherent contradiction between nationalism and globalism, and that we should choose nationalism and reject globalism. But this is a dangerous mistake. There is no contradiction between nationalism and globalism. Because nationalism isn’t about hating foreigners. Nationalism is about loving your compatriots. And in the 21st century, in order to protect the safety and the future of your compatriots, you must cooperate with foreigners.  Nationalism and globalism aren't mutually exclusive. So in the 21st century, good nationalists must be also globalists. Now globalism doesn’t mean establishing a global government, abandoning all national traditions, or opening the border to unlimited immigration. Rather, globalism means a commitment to some global rules. Rules that don’t deny the uniqueness of each nation, but only regulate the relations between nations. And a good model is the Football World Cup. The World Cup is a competition between nations, and people often show fierce loyalty to their national team. But at the same time the World Cup is also an amazing display of global harmony. France can't play football against Croatia unless the French and the Croatians agree on the same rules for the game. And that’s globalism in action.  Global solutions for global problems. If you like the World Cup – you are already a globalist. Now hopefully, nations could agree on global rules not just for football, but also for how to prevent ecological collapse, how to regulate dangerous technologies, and how to reduce global inequality. How to make sure, for example, that AI benefits Mexican textile workers and not only American software engineers. Now of course this is going to be much more difficult than football – but not impossible. Because the impossible, well we have already accomplished the impossible. We have already escaped the violent jungle in which we humans have lived throughout history. For thousands of years, humans lived under the law of the jungle in a condition of omnipresent war. The law of the jungle said that for every two nearby countries, there is a plausible scenario that they will go to war against each other next year. Under this law, peace meant only “the temporary absence of war.” When there was “peace” between – say – Athens and Sparta, or France and Germany, it meant that now they are not at war, but next year they might be. And for thousands of years, people had assumed that it was impossible to escape this law.  Have we broken the law of the jungle? But in the last few decades, humanity has managed to do the impossible, to break the law, and to escape the jungle. We have built the rule-based liberal global order, that despite many imperfections, has nevertheless created the most prosperous and most peaceful era in human history. The very meaning of the word “peace” has changed. “Peace” no longer means just the temporary absence of war. Peace now means the implausibility of war. There are many countries which you simply cannot imagine going to war against each other next year – like France and Germany. There are still wars in some parts of the world. I come from the Middle East, so believe me, I know this perfectly well. But it shouldn't blind us to the overall global picture.  Causes of death in 2016 - obesity, diabetes and more We are now living in a world in which war kills fewer people than suicide, and gunpowder is far less dangerous to your life than sugar. Most countries – with some notable exceptions like Russia – don’t even fantasize about conquering and annexing their neighbors, which is why most countries can afford to spend maybe just about 2% of their GDP on defense, while spending far, far more on education and healthcare. This is not a jungle. Unfortunately, we have gotten so used to this wonderful situation that we take it for granted, and we are therefore becoming extremely careless. Instead of doing everything we can to strengthen the fragile global order, countries neglect it and even deliberately undermine it. The global order is now like a house that everybody inhabits and nobody repairs. It can hold on for a few more years, but if we continue like this, it will collapse – and we will find ourselves back in the jungle of omnipresent war. We have forgotten what it's like, but believe me as a historian – you don’t want to be back there. It is far, far worse than you imagine. Yes, our species has evolved in that jungle and lived and even prospered there for thousands of years, but if we return there now, with the powerful new technologies of the twenty-first century, our species will probably annihilate itself.  What will be left? Of course, even if we disappear, it will not be the end of the world. Something will survive us. Perhaps the rats will eventually take over and rebuild civilization. Perhaps, then, the rats will learn from our mistakes. But I very much hope we can rely on the leaders assembled here, and not on the rats.

Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna were headed to a basketball game when their helicopter crashed. Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images/AFP  LOS ANGELES, USA (UPDATED) – Nine people were killed in the helicopter crash which claimed the life of NBA star Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Los Angeles officials confirmed on Sunday, January 26. Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said 8 passengers and the pilot of the aircraft died in the accident. ""There were no survivors... There were 9 people on board the aircraft, the pilot plus 8 individuals,"" Villanueva said. The helicopter crashed in foggy weather in the Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas. Authorities said firefighters received a call at 9:47 am about the crash, which caused a brush fire on a hillside. The Los Angeles Times quoted police as saying that weather conditions were such that the Los Angeles Police Department's air support division grounded its helicopters until the afternoon, when the fog lifted. ""The weather situation did not meet our minimum standards for flying,"" said police spokesman Josh Rubenstein. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said firefighters had to hike to the site with medical equipment and hose lines to extinguish the blaze. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti confirmed that Bryant's 13-year-old daughter Gianna was among the victims. ""L.A. is grieving with the Bryant family over the loss of Gianna, who perished with her father and friends in today's tragedy,"" Garcetti wrote on Twitter. Gianna was one of Bryant's 4 children with his wife Vanessa. The retired NBA star, 41, and Gianna were flying to a game his daughter was expected to play in when their helicopter crashed, according to US reports. Local media said the other victims included another player and a parent. Orange Coast College confirmed that its baseball coach, John Altobelli, 56, was on board the helicopter. CNN said Altobelli's wife, Keri, and one of their two daughters, Alyssa, were also aboard the chopper. Villaneuva told reporters the authorities would not identify the victims pending notification of family members and identification from the coroner's office. ""It would be extremely disrespectful to understand your loved one has perished and you learn about it from TMZ,"" Villanueva said, referring to the celebrity news website that first broke the news about the crash. ""That is just wholly inappropriate so we are not going to be going there. We are going to wait until the coroner does their job."" The National Transportation Safety Board said it was dispatching an 18-person team to California to help with the investigation into the crash. ""Our team will be looking at the history of the pilot and whatever crew was on board,"" said Jennifer Homendy, a member of the NTSB. ""We will be looking at maintenance records of the helicopter. We will be looking at records of the owner and operator of the helicopter and a number of other things."" She added that the helicopter was a Sikorsky S-76B that has a black box which investigators will seek to recover. According to data from flightradar24.com, a flight tracking site, the chopper took off from John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana at 9:06 am. It headed northwest, reportedly to Mamba Sports Academy in Newbury Park, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) away. – Rappler.com  "

Trump says Bolton's statements were made 'only to sell a book.'  BOLTON. Former national security advisor John Bolton speaks to the Federalist Society in Washington DC on September 10, 2018, when he was still in office. Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP WASHINGTON, DC, USA (UPDATED) – President Donald Trump on Monday, January 27 denied that he told his former national security advisor John Bolton that military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating his political rivals. Trump's tweets came after The New York Times reported Sunday that Bolton alleges as much in a draft of his upcoming book. ""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination,"" Trump tweeted in the early hours of Monday. ""If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."" Citing Bolton's unpublished manuscript, The Times wrote that Trump told Bolton he wanted to keep frozen $391 million in aid to Ukraine until Kiev officials helped with a probe into his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump was impeached last month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. House of Representatives prosecutors have spent three days laying out a detailed case that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to open an investigation into Biden and the former vice president's son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Democrats quickly seized on the report to press demands that Bolton and other key people in the Trump administration be called testify in Trump's impeachment trial. A key point of Trump's impeachment defense has been that there was no quid-pro-quo. Trump's team has maintained that the holdup in aid was separate from his requests for an investigation into the Bidens. Bolton's reported assertion in the manuscript would undercut this. The Democrats want key Trump administration officials to testify -- including Bolton and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney -- believing they know a lot about Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Bolton has said he is willing to testify if subpoenaed. In response to The Times' report, the lead House manager in the trial, Adam Schiff, tweeted that Trump had ""blocked our request for Bolton's testimony.""

The Philippine government improves its tax collections for POGOs in 2019. Photo by Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government’s crackdown against tax-dodging Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) yielded to more revenues, as it was able to collect P6.4 billion in taxes in 2019, 169% higher than the P2.4 billion collected in 2018. But billions more need to be collected. The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) collected P5.1 billion in withholding taxes, P644.1 million in income taxes, P91.1 million in value-added taxes and percentage taxes, P81.1 million in documentary stamp taxes, and P469.1 million in other taxes from POGOs. (READ: Online gambling: Good for whose business?) Despite the surge in collections, there is much more to collect from the industry that has raked in mounds of cash that may be equivalent to a full percentage point of the country’s gross domestic product. BIR has issued some 170 notices to collect a total of P27.4 billion in tax liabilities from errant POGOs. The bureau aimed to collect P2 billion from these companies a month. The interagency task force responsible for chasing after foreign nationals not paying the right taxes was able to temporarily shut down several POGOs last year. These companies opened shop just days after committing to pay the right taxes. While tax collection has improved, the Philippine government needs to catch up on the industry that has exponentially grown despite China's disapproval. (READ: [ANALYSIS] Duterte and the POGO dilemma) For one, the government’s basic data on the industry are not aligned. BIR estimates around 103,000 foreign workers in the POGO industry, yet the Department of Labor and Employment counted only over 86,000. Meanwhile, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, the agency which grants licenses to POGOS, said that there are over 93,000 workers. Industry sources said POGO workers go as high as 400,000. Security concerns have also grown, as kidnapping incidents and other crimes in the capital has been more rampant due to the rise of the industry. – Rappler.com  "

Guevarra says President Duterte threatened but did not order to terminate the VFA  JOINT DRILLS. The Philippine Marines and US forces opened the 3rd KAMANDAG joint exercises at Subic Bay International Airport on October 9, 2019. Photo by Nappy Manegdeg/Rappler.com MANILA, Philippines – After initially kickstarting the termination of the 20-year-old Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the United States (US), the Duterte government is now taking a step back and is preparing an impact assessment report. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told reporters on Monday, January 27 that Malacañang has ordered a ""preliminary impact assessment on the possible termination of the VFA."" ""We have just been instructed today to expand the scope of our study to include a preliminary impact assessment on the possible termination of the VFA,"" Guevarra said on Monday, the day he is supposed to submit his legal memorandum to President Rodrigo Duterte on the procedures to terminate the VFA. Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said on Friday, January 24, that he would ""start the process"" of terminating the VFA, a day after Duterte said he would terminate the VFA because the US canceled the visa of his former police chief and now Senator Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa. The visa cancelation is widely seen as an effect of the Global Magnitsky Act that imposes sanctions on human rights violators. Guevarra could not categorically answer whether the termination is now on hold pending the assessment report. ""It is my understanding that the President has threatened, but has not given an order, to terminate the VFA. That's why his office has requested us to study the potential impact of such termination,"" said Guevarra. Effects on EDCA, MDT Guevarra and the Department of Justice (DOJ) was supposed to craft a memorandum that was ""purely legal,"" meaning it would not touch on the ""wisdom of the action."" Asked on Monday whether the assessment would now include impact on foreign relations, the effect on the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) – the operational aspect of the VFA – and the overarching Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), Guevarra said: ""Looks like ganun na nga (It looks like that's the case)."" ""But I will ask to convene the Cabinet cluster on justice and security and/or the VFA commission for an in-depth and comprehensive impact assessment,"" said Guevarra. The cluster includes the Department of National Defense (DND), Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA), and the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES). Guevarra was unable to provide a timeframe to complete the assessment report, saying ""'yung sa legal side madali lang, 'yung impact assessment ang kailangan ng masuring pag-aaral (the legal side is easy, the impact assessment needs extensive study)."" The VFA Asked why Malacañang suddenly wanted an impact assessment report when last week it had already started the process of terminating, Guevarra said: ""Only Malacañang can answer that."" The VFA, ratified by the Philippine Senate in 1999, was an affirmation of the Philippines and US' obligations under the 1951 MDT. The MDT was a commitment to defend each other in case of an attack. The Aquino-time EDCA, which provided for increased military presence of the US in the Philippines, operationalized the VFA. Several progressive groups have tried to revoke VFA via the Supreme Court on grounds that it violates Philippine sovereignty and that it is a lopsided agreement that protects US soldiers who commit crimes here. The Supreme Court upheld the VFA in 2000 saying the Court was ""without power to conduct an incursion and meddle with such affairs purely executive and legislative in character and nature."" – Rappler.com "

575,250293,"January 27, 2020",NBA,"Kobe's relentless spirit inspired NBA fans, players",Agence France-Presse,"'I love everything about this game. For me, it's not a part of life, it is life, and it's a part of me,' Kobe Bryant said   FAREWELL. Kobe Bryant leaves an unmatched legacy. Photo by Mark R. Cristino/EPA  WASHINGTON, USA – Kobe Bryant used a ferocious competitiveness and uncanny shooting touch to become an NBA icon, leaving behind a legacy that has influenced the newest generation of league talent and fans worldwide. From his 81-point game, the second-best scoring performance in NBA history, to 5 NBA titles in 20 years of dazzling performances with the Los Angeles Lakers, Bryant delivered a relentless attitude that attracted a global following before his death Sunday at age 41 in a helicopter crash. Bryant joined giant center Shaquille O'Neal to spark the Lakers to NBA titles in 2000, 2001 and 2002, becoming at the age of 23 the youngest player to capture 3 titles. A bitter feud with Bryant saw ""Shaq"" depart, with Bryant portrayed as never having had childish ways while O'Neal never outgrew them. That left Bryant without the inside force needed to capture the crown until Spain's Pau Gasol arrived, and the Lakers won titles in 2009 and 2010 with Bryant in command and later patching things up with O'Neal. Bryant sparked the US Olympic team to gold medals at the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics and became a global celebrity as much for his personality as his playmaking. Bryant's fierceness was legendary and led him to nickname himself the ""Black Mamba"" for his ability to strike quickly with deadly scoring accuracy. There were spectacular nights, but nothing topped his 81-point effort against the Toronto Raptors on January 22, 2006, a mark surpassed only by Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant scored 65 points in a 2007 win over Portland, then followed with 50 points against Minnesota, 60 at Memphis and 50 more against New Orleans – the third-longest run of 50-point games in NBA history behind two from Chamberlain. Some say Bryant saved the best for last, scoring a league season-high of 60 points against Utah in his final NBA game in 2016, becoming the oldest player in league history to crack that milestone at age 37. ""I love everything about this game,"" Bryant famously said. ""For me, it's not a part of life, it is life, and it's a part of me."" In all, Bryant finished with 33,643 points, 7,047 rebounds and 6,306 assists over 1,346 career NBA games. He was an 18-time NBA All-Star, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player, the NBA Finals 2009 and 2010 NBA MVP and matched a record as a four-time NBA All-Star Game MVP. Kobe faced controversy But it wasn't a smooth path to stardom. In addition to nagging injuries that slowed his later seasons, Bryant faced a major rape controversy that delivered a body blow to his endorsements image. A father of 4 who married wife Vanessa in 2001, Bryant faced his darkest hour in 2003 when he was arrested in Colorado over a sexual assault allegation filed by a 19-year-old employee of a hotel where Bryant was staying ahead of knee surgery. Bryant was accused of rape. He admitted to adultery but said he did not commit rape. In 2004, the case was dropped after the accuser refused to testify in a trial, and Bryant issued an apology saying he could understand how she might feel if there was no consent. A separate civil suit was settled under terms kept private. In 2011, Bryant made an apology for using a gay slur to describe a referee and paid a $100,000 fine imposed by the NBA. Knee and ankle injuries mounted as years began to take a toll on Bryant. He missed most of the 2013-2014 season with a left knee injury and much of his penultimate campaign with a torn right rotator cuff, then announced his retirement by saying, ""My body knows it's time to say goodbye."" After retiring, Bryant became a children's book writer and wrote the movie ""Dear Basketball"" – last year's Academy Award winner for Best Animated Short Film. Basketball is life Kobe Bean Bryant, the son of former NBA player Joe ""Jellybean"" Bryant, was born in Philadelphia in 1978 while his father played for the NBA's 76ers, the child named for the Japanese beef seen on a menu and his father's nickname. The elder Bryant played from 1984 to 1991 in Italy, giving young Kobe a global worldview as he grew up dreaming of following his dad into the NBA. ""When I was growing up in Italy, it opened up a whole new world to me and I thought anything was possible,"" Kobe told AFP in 2009. Bryant became one of the first NBA players to seek out a growing fan base in China, blogging for Chinese internet giant SINA in 2009. ""As a kid growing up, I never in my wildest dreams thought I would have this big fan base halfway around the world in Beijing and Shanghai,"" Bryant told AFP. – Rappler.com  "

Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP LOS ANGELES, USA (UPDATED) – Goth-inspired pop innovator Billie Eilish cleaned up at Sunday's Grammys, winning all 4 major awards including the prestigious Album of the Year prize. The 18-year-old beat out stiff competition from viral hitmaker Lil Nas X and the year's most-nominated artist Lizzo. Eilish soared to mainstream stardom over the past year, after having won a fervent online following for her in-your-face pop sound that can get a little creepy at times, with haunting melodies and heavy bass. ""Mainly I think the fans deserve everything. I feel like they have not been talked about enough tonight because they're the only reason any of us are here at all,"" she said. ""So thanks to the fans."" She shared her success with her older brother Finneas O'Connell, her primary creative collaborator. ""We just make music in a bedroom together,"" said O'Connell. ""We still do that and they let us do that. (...) This is to all of the kids making music in your bedrooms today – you're going to get one of these."" Eilish also offered a shoutout to pop sensation Ariana Grande, saying she in fact deserved Album of the Year for thank u, next. The teen star was among the leading Grammy nominees at Sunday's gala – just 17 when the shortlists came out, she is the youngest person ever nominated in all of the top 4 categories. She scored a total of 5 awards on 6 nominations, including both Record and Song of the Year for ""Bad Guy"" – which made her the first musician born in the 2000s to top the Billboard Hot 100. In claiming the spot, she finally booted Lil Nas X, the country-trap sensation whose viral hit ""Old Town Road"" set a record of 19 weeks atop the US songs list. Eilish has been an outspoken advocate for action to tackle climate change, banning plastic straws at her shows and encouraging fans to bring their own refillable water bottles. The artist named Billboard's 2019 Woman of the Year has also written and will perform the theme song for the upcoming James Bond film No Time To Die. ""I feel like I'm not supposed to be here,"" she told E! television on the red carpet before the gala. ""Life is weird.""  "

Rowena, a daycare worker and a mother, is among the tens of thousands of women who are poised to benefit from the unpaid care ordinance enacted by the local government of Salcedo. Photo by Jed Regala/Oxfam  Rowena, from Salcedo in the Philippines, is a daycare worker at a local school. After she’s done with her day’s work, she comes home to care for her family. As a housewife, her care work takes a lot of time and literally means heavy lifting: “The heaviest housework is fetching water. It takes us 3 to 4 hours to go and get water because our water source is far. We have to go to the river and lift our own water cans.” Rowena and other women in Salcedo are constantly working at home and at their jobs, anxious about earning enough to keep kids in school, having enough money to survive, and being barely prepared for times of trouble such as disasters that regularly happen across Asia, the latest of which is the Taal volcano eruption in Philippines. Lim Kok Thay, the highest-paid CEO in Malaysia, is one of the wealthiest men in the country. The billionaire, son to founder of Genting Group, builds his wealth on a portfolio of casinos, tourism, and oil investments. He adds to his wealth every year with his salary of US$ 68.6 million from two positions at Genting Bhd and Genting Malaysia Bhd. His earnings per minute are at least US$290. For a domestic care worker who struggles to get through the day, it would take 21,561 years to earn what Lim earns in a year. In turn, Lim would earn what a domestic worker earns in a year in just 10 minutes. Does that sound fair to the Rowenas of the world? (READ: Why many of the hungry are women) Asia truly is a tale of two fortunes. While Asia’s billionaires wallow in wealth, it’s also home to the world’s largest population of those struggling to make ends meet – 1.2 billion people living in and near poverty. 831 billionaires in Asia and Pacific own 2,700 billion in wealth, which is more than 1.8 billion of us have. In the region, China has the most billionaires – 324, followed by India with 106. MOTHER.

Photo by April Abello-Bulanadi/Oxfam The problem is global, too. 4.6 billion of us have less wealth than the world’s 2,513 billionaires. That a few thrive while a majority strive hard for a decent living is a symptom of a global epidemic. In fact, most of us will struggle to make ends meet if we miss a paycheck due to sickness or family trouble; a clear sign of an economy and system that’s failing. Inequality that ails our economies is out of control and keeps growing, leaving billions behind, particularly women and girls. Of the estimated 67 million domestic workers worldwide, 80% are women. While many governments have committed to reducing inequalities, they are barely walking their talk. We must demand that they prioritize the needs of people who elected them over the profits and fortunes of a few at the top. By making sure businesses and the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, our leaders can invest in our wellbeing now and for the future. The wealthy have gotten away with paying little either by using legal loopholes or illegally dodging taxes altogether. Asians believe that widespread corruption among leaders of nations and government service providers has stalemated the kind of progress that can benefit many. We know that when nations spend more of their resources earned through fair taxation on public services like schools, hospitals, social safety and other public services, the lives of millions, if not billions, significantly improve. For instance, taxing an additional 0.5% of the wealth of the richest 1% over 10 years and spending on public goods can create 117 million jobs in education, health, elderly care, and other sectors.

Photo by April Abello-Bulanadi/Oxfam We also have some examples from countries in Asia – Thailand, Philippines and elsewhere – where good policies implemented well have transformed the lives of millions, but there just aren’t enough. For the billionaires of the world, a high-quality education, great health care, and meeting all other needs is a birthright, but for the Rowenas, who are a majority in Asia, these rights are unmet, unfulfilled. And there lies the injustice. Oxfam’s report ""Time to Care,"" launched at the World Economic Forum convened in Davos, shows how, despite the tremendous contribution women and girls make to running the global economy, their work is often unrecognized. Women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day – a contribution to the global economy of at least $10.8 trillion a year. (READ: More women prefer working than staying at home – ILO) Governments can ease the burden of care workers drastically by investing public funds. Universal access to safe water, sanitation, energy, universal childcare, eldercare, and care for people with disabilities would go a long way towards improving their lives and creating opportunities for them to achieve a better tomorrow. Paid care workers are underpaid and undervalued. Domestic workers, nurses, child and elderly caregivers, those who work in hospitality, and others often don’t enjoy full labor rights or a decent wage enough to meet their needs. Governments must sign on and implement the International Labor Organizations Convention 189 to protect their rights. Make no mistake. Care work is work that’s essential for our societies to survive, prosper, and grow. It is the hidden engine that runs our economies. Nurturing children, caring for the sick and elderly, and all the mundane household chores are critical necessities. It’s largely the burden of women and girls. Globally, 42% of women of working age are outside the paid labor force, compared with 6% of men, because of unpaid care responsibilities. All women and girls have the right to a fair living wage. We must put an end to the wage-pay gap between men and women and end discrimination at work completely. Care workers need a voice at decision-making tables not only in governments but in their communities and places of work. Within businesses, women and girls are often relegated to low-paying jobs at the lowest end of value chains. For instance, in the seafood industry, women are limited to bottom-rung jobs like cleaning and packing. (READ: Women, the sea, and food security) The contribution of care work by women and girls is more than thrice the contribution made by the entire global tech industry. And this figure is probably an underestimation as many forms of care work is invisible. We need to respect care work, recognize the role it plays in making our society function and reward care workers justly. We must, as a society, embrace care work as a duty of all – men, boys, women, and girls. We need to build a new story for a more humane economy where prosperity is shared, and it must show care work the respect it deserves. Our societies and cultures here in Asia have long placed care as a virtue of the highest order – caring for our people, our families, our kids, elders, neighbors, even those different to us. It’s high time we walk our values and put our money where our ideals are. – Rappler.com Lan Mercado is the Regional Director for Oxfam in Asia.

File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – If only to have talks on the Philippines' bilateral ties with the United States, former foreign secretary Albert del Rosario urged President Rodrigo Duterte to accept US President Donald Trump's invitation for a summit. Del Rosario gave the recommendation following Duterte's threat to terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with Washington if the US fails to ""correct"" Philippine Senator Ronald dela Rosa's canceled visa. ""Should our President wish to improve the MDT (Mutual Defense Treaty) and the VFA, he may wish to accept the invitation to meet President Trump. This would present an excellent opportunity for our President to place on the table his full expectations pertaining to our bilateral relations,"" Del Rosario said in a statement on Sunday, January 26. Duterte earlier rejected Trump's invite for him and other Southeast Asian leaders to attend a special summit in Las Vegas in March. In declining the invite, the Philippine President harked back to his tumultuous relationship with former US president Barack Obama, who was critical of Duterte's war on drugs. Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr also announced on Friday, January 24, that he would ""start the process"" of terminating the VFA, a day after Duterte's threat. 'Imperfect,' but 'essential' Del Rosario said that while the VFA is ""imperfect,"" it is ""essential"" for the two countries' decades-old defense alliance. ""While the VFA is admittedly an imperfect agreement, [junking] it would interrupt the benefits of the MDT with regards to the joint training and exercises, the pursuit of modernization, achieving interoperability, and providing assistance during natural calamities,"" he said. The 69-year-old MDT, which covers the South China Sea, is seen as a deterrent to China's aggressive tactics against its fellow maritime claimants. Del Rosario warned that terminating the VFA would actualize the Philippines' pivot to China, ""against the strong and vehement objections of our people."" He also recalled how the VFA made quick US aid possible when the Philippines was hit by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013. ""Other countries wanted to immediately respond but were constrained by the lack of legal arrangements for their troops to enter the Philippines. At its peak, the US military efforts included more than 13,000 military personnel, 66 aircraft, and 12 naval vessels. The US delivered more than 2,500 tons of relief supplies and evacuated over 21,000 people,"" he said. Palace says no In response, Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte does not need Del Rosario's advice. ""I suggest he stays retired. The President knows what he is doing, he does not need advice...especially from the one who lost the West Philippine Sea to the Chinese government,"" Panelo said. Del Rosario, a staunch defender of the West Philippine Sea, was foreign secretary when the Philippines took China to court – and won. The Duterte administration has since downplayed the victory in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in exchange for loans and grants from Beijing. The VFA, ratified by the Philippine Senate in 1999, outlines guidelines for the conduct of American troops visiting the Philippines and is the foundation for military exercises between the Philippines and the US. The Aquino-time Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which provided for increased US military presence in the Philippines, operationalized the VFA. – Rappler.com "

588,250307,"January 28, 2020",IMHO,[OPINION] It was more than just a dinner: On Imelda and the CCP,Fernan Talamayan,"Some Filipinos enjoyed a lavish dinner to 'honor' a convicted plunderer while the Taal evacuees suffered from hunger and thirst    During times of crises, Filipinos never fail to show compassion and solidarity. When the Taal Volcano spewed ash, Filipinos from different walks of life exerted effort to help those affected by the eruption – some willingly shared food and water to those in need, while some washed volcanic ash off windshields of passing cars so that drivers could safely reach their homes. Others organized to donate whatever was needed in evacuation centers. It is also during crises that acts of outrageous insensitivity stick out like a sore thumb. There were internet trolls who spread fake news at a time when information was crucial in risk mitigation. There were bloggers who bashed politicians who were actively helping evacuees. There were also lawmakers who held a plenary session in calamity-stricken areas to take advantage of the situation. Worst of all, some enjoyed a lavish dinner to “honor” a convicted plunderer while the Taal evacuees suffered from hunger and thirst. Amid the Taal Volcano crisis, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) held a “fancy sit-down” dinner to celebrate its 50th anniversary last January 15. To mark this auspicious event, they chose to “honor” CCP’s founding chair, Imelda Marcos. (READ: FAST FACTS: Imelda Marcos, the 'Iron Butterfly') Netizens reacted angrily to this, as they called out the said government institution (as well as the Marcoses) for their lack of delicadeza. As people observed how disconnected the CCP leadership is to the masses, a few days later, the CCP defended its appreciation dinner with pronouncements that the event raised funds for the survivors of the Taal Volcano eruption. While the CCP’s hosting of this event was indeed worth calling out, such unbefitting conduct should not have come as a surprise given the participants’ history. It is for this reason that I raise another question concerning the recent glorification of Mrs. Marcos: how do we understand the link that ties Mrs. Marcos, the CCP, and the arts? I believe that what truly makes the appreciation dinner disturbing is its potential contribution to Marcos historical revisionism. The dinner is also worthy of our criticism because of the context that enabled it. (READ: Edjop, Imelda Marcos, and the fear of forgetting) In all fairness, as the CCP’s founding chairperson, the CCP, of course, found it fitting to “honor” Mrs. Marcos. As the CCP vice president Chris Millado noted, “[I]t cannot be denied that Imelda founded this [CCP] during the Marcos years, that Imelda was the main patron for the establishment of this institution.” Simply put, it is impossible to celebrate the founding of CCP without remembering the role that Mrs. Marcos played in its establishment. Aside from the historical link that intertwines the CCP and Mrs. Marcos, the connection between the current CCP chair Margarita Moran-Floriendo and the Marcoses cannot be denied too, as the former Miss Universe 1973 Moran-Floriendo is married to the son of Antonio Floriendo Sr. – a Marcos crony known as the “banana king” and who served as Imelda’s dummy in many multi-million real estate deals in New York. (READ: DOCUMENT: Full decision convicting Imelda Marcos over illegal Swiss foundations) Beyond these connections, it must be remembered too that the Marcoses have long been regarded as “patrons” of the arts.  During the Martial Law years, they sponsored artists by sending them to study abroad or commissioning them to produce works of art. As such, a good number of artists in the Philippines were indebted to the Marcoses. It is perhaps these decades of involvement (or investment) in the Philippine art industry that enable the Marcoses to continue to participate in art circles. But do not be mistaken – such acts of “generosity” and “care” for Filipino artists were instrumental in advancing the Marcoses’ political propaganda. For instance, during the Martial Law years, the Marcoses commissioned Evan Cosayo to depict themselves as “Malakas” and “Maganda.” The production of such images contributed to their systematic reconfiguration of Philippine myths, in their attempt to convince the people that they were the “First Filipinos” of the “new” Philippine society. The painting also created an image of the Marcoses as “parents” of the Philippine society, which meant that they should always be obeyed and respected in return for their “care” and “kindness.” (READ: TIMELINE: How the Marcoses made their political comeback) So yes, it was wrong for CCP to host a lavish event to “honor” Mrs. Marcos amid the Taal Volcano crisis. It was right to call-out the CCP leadership for such a distasteful act. However, we should, at the same time, express strong concern over the continued influence and involvement of the Marcoses in Philippine arts and politics. While one can argue that the event is unrelated to any pro-Marcos propaganda, it must be noted that a government-sponsored glorification of a Marcos could help put the Marcoses (and the Martial Law years) in a good light. It contributes to the promotion of the Marcos-led “golden years” that never were. Hence, condemnation of the extravagant dinner at CCP should imply not only disgust against insensitivity, but also vigilance toward activities that promote Marcos-led deception and propaganda. – Rappler.com Fernan Talamayan is a doctoral student at the Institute of Social Research and Cultural Studies, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan.

(READ: The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?) Safety from the Wuhan virus was one of the prayers by Santo Niño devotees in Singapore on Sunday. With some of them wearing surgical masks, devotees joined not only the Mass but also the Sinulog procession afterwards. ""Since there's the coronavirus, hopefully no Filipino is affected by this disease,"" said Janice Papa, a Filipino who has been working in Singapore for almost 11 years. Papa, who has attended Sinulog celebrations in Singapore since 6 years ago, also prayed that Taal Volcano would not erupt again, and that she might have good health. One of the event's organizers, Eric Naguiat, also prayed that the Wuhan virus ""will be prevented soon,"" and that victims ""be given God's grace for their fast healing.""

The Wuhan virus, however, did not stop the Sinulog in Singapore from demonstrating the vibrant faith of Filipinos anywhere in the world. Still it showed how Filipinos, from merely receiving the Gospel from Spaniards almost 500 years ago, are now the ones spreading Catholicism worldwide – in the words of Pope Francis late last year, ""smugglers of the faith.""

591,250310,"January 28, 2020",iSpeak,[OPINION] Speaking truth to power: Why the government should listen to scientists,Timothy Gardner,"'Scientists provide a path through the dark of misunderstanding...and governments around the world would do well to listen to them. Especially when it's not convenient.'    In an era of misinformation, twisted half-truths, and downright lies, incorporating science into good governance is not just important, it is vital. Science, as an evidence-based discipline, sometimes feels at odds with the current political environment, which often seems to ignore evidence freely and whenever it is convenient. I am a young American scientist who was fortunate enough to do marine mammal work in the Philippines with support from the Fulbright program. Unfortunately, I can attest to the fact that the pointed refusal to acknowledge facts, namely when they interfere with agendas or talking points, is, and has been, an international political trend. Not only is this frustrating, but it is downright dangerous. The denial of science and facts interferes with governments around the world being able to prepare for, mediate, and respond to crises like emerging epidemics, natural disasters, and climate change. Scientific conclusions have to be backed by carefully collected data. In many research circles, the running joke is that data doesn’t care about your feelings. This tends to become apparent at the worst of times – for example, the night before an undergraduate lab report is due, months into thesis preparation, or when you realize your experimental design is wrong at 3 am. But this seemingly cold indifference is in large part where science derives its strength. When done well, scientific conclusions are sound because they can stand alone, independent of the researchers that crafted them. In an ideal world, this would make science highly sought after in government. If multiple researchers who, as human beings, have their own set of biases even as they seek to limit them come to the same conclusions, those results can be trusted as apolitical. In this, science has the capacity to reach across ideological divides. One of its core principles is that scientific conclusions should be reproducible anywhere by anyone (if their funding hasn’t dried up). Instead, the reaction to unfortunate scientific findings is often ridicule and scorn. I am immensely grateful that the United States has a long history of investing in scientific research through programs like the National Science Foundation. However, even just last week, President Trump ridiculed climate activists like Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate at the World Economic Forum in Davos, calling them “perennial prophets of doom” and “heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers,” even when the broad consensus that climate change is real, caused by human activity, and dangerous is backed by heaps of evidence collected from around the globe. This moment is just one example of an alarming disconnect between scientific reality and political action. However, when coupled, science and policy can tackle monumental problems, including natural disasters. When predictions are sound and evacuations are planned and implemented before danger strikes, lives are saved. When they aren’t, the results can be catastrophic. With the ongoing Taal eruption, Phivolcs has had the difficult task of balancing risk assessment and the unfortunate reality that mass evacuations put people in difficult, distressing situations. Leaving homes, animals, and belongings behind, knowing they might be buried under a blanket of ash when you return, is far from easy. But if Phivolcs reduces warning levels too soon, thousands of people could be caught in the path of an incinerating pyroclastic flow or other volcanic hazard. In this, Phivolcs bears a great and difficult responsibility. (READ: Netizens defend Phivolcs amid criticisms) Scientific organizations like Phivolcs often seem to get caught between the dueling questions of “What is going on?” and “Tell me what I want to hear.” But when scientific conclusions are listened to, even at their most dire, a necessary cooperation is forged between science and policy. Natural disasters, many of which are being strengthened by climate change, remind us how fragile life can be. Typhoons, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and earthquakes are facts of life. Even when we don’t want them to strike, they will. There are scientists working around the world, around the clock, to keep us informed and safe. Understanding our world makes it a safer one, because in the face of disaster, the most important thing is that we are prepared. I have had the distinct privilege of working with many hard-working, dedicated Filipino scientists, and am even luckier to call them my friends and mentors. They deserve a seat at the decision-making table, just as scientists in the United States deserve it in our government. Science’s role in governance should be to inform and impact good political decision-making, and this can only be achieved by affording scientists respect and support, and that includes funding. The globalized world often feels overwhelming, with new problems emerging faster than existing one’s can be solved. Scientists provide a path through the dark of misunderstanding, and as the new decade begins, governments around the world would do well to listen to them. Especially when it's not convenient. – Rappler.com Timothy Gardner is an environmental scientist and marine mammal researcher from the United States.

Gianna Bryant is killed at 13 years old. Photo from Instagram/@kobebryant MANILA, Philippines – Gianna Maria-Onere, the 13-year-old daughter of NBA legend Kobe Bryant, was among the 9 people killed in the Los Angeles helicopter crash that also claimed the life of her father. Kobe and Gianna were reportedly on their way to the Mamba Sports Academy, which the late NBA great co-founded, when the helicopter crashed in foggy conditions in the Los Anges suburb of Calabasas.

She, her older sister Natalia, and their mother Vanessa frequently watched Los Angeles Lakers games when Kobe was still playing in the NBA. Gigi was there when Kobe played his final game in 2016 as he dropped 60 points against the Utah Jazz in a storybook ending to a celebrated career.

A visitor checks in at the Amazon corporate headquarters on June 16, 2017 in Seattle, Washington. File photo by David Ryder/Getty Images/AFP SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Hundreds of Amazon employees on Sunday, January 26, openly criticized the online retail giant's environmental record, in violation of the company's communications policy. More than 300 signed a Medium blog post by Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ), which is pushing the company to go further in its climate change mitigation plan which was announced with great publicity in September. Group members have publicly criticized the company, and some have been warned that they could be fired. ""The protest is the largest action by employees since Amazon began threatening to fire workers for speaking out about Amazon's role in the climate crisis,"" the AECJ said. ""As Amazon workers, we are responsible for not only the success of the company, but its impact as well. It's our moral responsibility to speak up, and the changes to the communications policy are censoring us from exercising that responsibility,"" said Sarah Tracy, a software development engineer at Amazon. It is common for companies to demand restraint from employees when it comes to publicly discussing the firm's activities and even more so when openly questioning them. Amazon had nearly 650,000 permanent employees at the end of 2018, according to the company's annual report. While the environment and climate change was the focus of many of the posts on Sunday, Amazon was also criticized for other activities such as providing artificial intelligence capabilities to companies in the oil sector. Amazon is often criticized over its carbon footprint because of the high energy consumption of its huge server farms for its lucrative cloud computing activities. And it has built its success on the back of a huge road transport logistics network to ensure speedy deliveries, which generates a lot of greenhouse gases, the main culprit of climate change. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on September 19 last year made public environmental commitments, promising in particular that the firm would be carbon neutral by 2040. The AECJ said this was insufficient and Amazon should be aiming for a 2030 target. ""This is not the time for silencing voices. We need policies that welcome more open discourse, more problem-solving, and more urgent and concerted action about climate change and its causes,"" said Mark Hiew, a senior marketing manager at Amazon. Amazon did not respond to an AFP request for a response but an article in the Bezos-owned Washington Post quoted spokesman Drew Herdener as saying Amazon encouraged employees to express themselves, but internally through the various platforms available to them. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Czeasar Dancel/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – A national political reporter for The Washington Post is in trouble after posting a controversial tweet relating to Kobe Bryant’s 2003 rape case just hours after the former NBA player’s death on Monday, January 27, Philippine time. Felicia Sonmez posted a tweet that linked to a The Daily Beast article titled “Kobe Bryant’s Disturbing Rape Case: The DNA Evidence, the Accuser’s Story, and the Half-Confession.” The story includes details of the then-19-year-old accuser’s testimony about how the player choked and forced himself into her even as she repeatedly said no. She added that she knew Bryant had heard her because “every time I said no he tightened his hold around me.” The case ended as the accuser refused to testify in a trial while a separate civil suit was settled out-of-court. Immediately after the tweet, Sonmez was hit with a barrage of replies from an angered Twitter mob – calling for her firing, that she be sent to Wuhan in China, and calling her out for what they perceived was insensitivity and a lack of empathy.

596,250315,"January 27, 2020",NBA,Kobe Bryant was a superhero of this generation,Naveen Ganglani,"The Black Mamba is dead, and with each passing second, that sentence grows more difficult to comprehend   LEGEND.The death of Kobe Bryant will be remembered as a day when the world – both in sports and out – stood still. Photo by Harry How/Getty Images/AFP  MANILA, Philippines – Kobe Bryant was a superhero, but not only because of his otherworldly ability to shoot a basketball through a hoop. He was a hero because he was inspiring beyond words; a champion who made the impossible looks realistic through sheer will and determination. “What’s the secret?” I asked him as an anxious 23-year-old reporter back in 2015 in Los Angeles, hoping to gain the knowledge that propelled him from being the chosen successor of His Airness, to creating his own legacy as The Black Mamba. Charismatic and brilliant, he answered that the secret is there is no secret. Because the secret is that it’s actually only “hard work.” Kobe Bryant is dead, and with each passing second, that sentence grows more difficult to comprehend. This has to all be a bad nightmare, right? When will we wake up? But it is real, and instead, our hearts are left shattered. For most of his Hall of Fame-bound career, Kobe Bryant seemed invincible. Actually, he was invincible. There was often a piercing look in his eyes; the same image that brought fear to his adversaries, and hope for the millions who adored his every step. Most of them wore purple and gold. He was a legend, in all shape and form. A global one, too.  Aftershocks The magic in life is finding what you love, he said back in 2016, after his retirement, when I spoke with him again in Manila – a place he admitted he loves. No wonder it looked like magic whenever he was on a basketball court, or whenever he visited our country. No one had a more beautiful jump shot. No one had a better display of footwork and fundamentals. No one had a stronger desire, aside from Michael Jordan, when it came to winning. Jordan, the man Kobe chased for the title of Greatest of all Time, felt larger than the game. But Kobe Bryant mastered it. The helicopter carrying Kobe, his beautiful and talented daughter Gianna, and 9 others crashed on Sunday, January 26 (US time) in Calabasas, California, as the party were on their way to a basketball game. There were no survivors. In heartbreaking fashion, families were torn apart, and the dreams of way too many were taken away. Hours later, the entire world felt aftershocks as result from the incident. We were left in disbelief. Others were in pain. The NBA community was in distraught. The games for the day should have been cancelled, it was argued online. The league pushed through with them anyway, and thankfully so, allowing those who were still unable to process heir grief an avenue to find company in misery. Matches started with 24-second shot clock violations in honor of Bryant. Players on the bench and basketball court were crying. In the twilight of his prime, Kobe made it a point to reach out to the Trae Youngs and Devin Bookers of the world, and was always eager to pass on what he had learned from his distinguished 20-year career. He cared about the young up-and-comers. He was the image of the posters on their childhood bedrooms. He loved the game more than life itself, and wanted to leave the league he helped catapult to stardom in good hands. Was Kobe perfect? No, but nobody is. He was an arrogant young talent who drove both his legendary teammate (Shaq) and head coach (Phil Jackson) away. There was the accusation of rape that eventually resulted unproven and was settled. His words on the court, in certain occasions, went too far. But the truly memorable stories aren’t those which are flawless from beginning to end; they are about the ability of human beings to rise up past trials and tribulations in order to grow as better individuals.  Sad, sad day Kobe’s roadblocks were always so public, but he still always had a charm that drew us in despite the complexities. So in his tale as a champion turned one-man show turned redeemed icon, we witnessed the theme that many others seek: Retribution and a second chance. Whether fanatic or critic, his journey brought all of us together, and his death now does the same, too, for we are reminded of how special and fragile both time and life are. “It’s just a sad, sad day,” said a choking Mike Breen, the greatest NBA sportscaster in history, who was at a loss for words. Even coaches who went to battle against Bryant’s Los Angeles Lakers – Gregg Popovich and Doc Rivers – were unable to control their emotions in interviews. Even as the Grammys took place at Staples Center – the arena Kobe made famous – thousands of peopled walked the streets of LA to pay homage to a fallen hero of this generation. Somehow, Bryant became even larger than life after the end of his playing days. Accomplishments in business, media, and even the Oscar factored in, with more success to come, but more than anything, he was adored because of how great a father he became. He loved his wife, Vanessa, and daughters – Natalia, Bianka, and Capri – with intense pride, and played the role of the ideal encouraging parent to perfection. Because of what he dreamt for them, he became an advocate of women’s basketball, and one of its patriarchs. Gianna Bryant, 13, had her whole life ahead of her, with a legacy she would create by herself on its way to fruition.  Greatness In the last decade, fans of Kobe, the Lakers, and the NBA watched his daughter grow from the adorable kid idolizing her father on the sidelines to future basketball sensation. That she was robbed of what was a lifetime of opportunities ahead of her is gut-wrenching. “The best thing that happens is when we go out and fans come up to me, and she'll be standing next to me… They’ll be like, “You gotta have a boy, have somebody carry on the legacy...” Bryant once revealed in an interview about Gigi. “She’s like, “Oh, I got this!’” Their bond was unique. What happened isn't fair. Ultimately as time passes by, the death of Kobe will resonate as strong as the loss of many other icons throughout history. It will be remembered as a day when the world – both in sports and out – stood still. Families returned home to each other remembering one of life’s best blessings – that we have the gift of sharing our precious time with loved ones, which we should never take for granted. Kobe Bryant never did. He was always on the quest for greatness, but always remembered what truly mattered. And in the future there will still be that kid – whether the one shooting hoops in the park, or throwing a crumpled paper in the trash – who will shout out, “KOBE!” with every attempt. We’ve lost a hero of our generation. But his legend will live forever. Rest easy, Kobe. We’ll miss you. – Rappler.com  "

Lil Nas X (center) performs with Jin, V, SUGA, Jimin, RM, J-Hope and Jungkook of BTS onstage during the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards at Staples Center on January 26, 2020 in Los Angeles, California. Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images/AFP LOS ANGELES, United States – The 2020 Grammys, which took place on Sunday, January 26, offered up a wide range of performances, including hits from pop's new stars, old-school tributes, and a few surprising group acts. Here's a rundown of the night's top stage moments: Rappers surprise on stage It was a wacky night for rap, with the genre-benders Lil Nas X and Tyler, the Creator delivering eclectic performances that had the audience on its feet. Lil Nas X – who won two awards on the night – delivered a wild rendition of his crossover smash hit ""Old Town Road"" with a coterie of guest stars. He began the tune on a rotating set that featured a tribute to the late NBA legend Kobe Bryant, his jersey displayed in the background.  A banjo-playing, bandana-wearing Diplo joined the meme king onstage along with the K-pop superstars BTS, campy country star Billy Ray Cyrus and none other than the rapper Nas. Tyler, the Creator gave a high-energy performance complete with pyrotechnics while wearing a pink and magenta color-block suit and a blond bowl-cut wig. Boyz II Men and R&B legend Charlie Wilson joined the 28-year-old artist onstage.  Shortly thereafter, the artist won the Grammy for Best Rap Album – a win he voiced happiness about, while also voicing worry about being pigeon-holed. ""Half of me feels like the rap nomination was a back-handed compliment,"" he told journalists backstage. ""It sucks that whenever we, and I mean guys that look like me, do anything that's genre-bending... they always put us in a rap or an urban category. ""I don't like that urban word. it's just a politically correct way to say the n-word."" Pop divas slay Pop princess Ariana Grande arrived at the Grammys in a cloud of blue-gray tulle. But once she got on the stage, she ended up in skimpy pink lingerie, gyrating with her dancers on a bed and throwing one sexy slumber party. Grande performed a medley of her hits: from ""Imagine,"" she segued into ""My Favorite Things"" from ""The Sound of Music"" – the bridge to her own song ""7 rings,"" which samples heavily from the show tune.  She finished up with a bit of ""thank u, next,"" the mega-hit off her album of the same name. It was a triumphant return to the Grammys stage for the 26-year-old, who pulled out of a performance last year over a dispute with producers about what she would sing. Singer Demi Lovato is on her way back after an overdose in 2018. On Sunday, she performed for the first time since then, singing ""Anyone"" – a song she told NBC News she wrote days before she nearly died as a ""cry for help."" After she appeared to choke up on the first few notes, the 27-year-old Lovato had to start again. When she resumed, tears were visible on her face.  ""Nobody's listening to me, nobody's listening,"" she sang in a raw, powerful voice. ""Anyone, please send me anyone. Lord, is there anyone? I need someone."" Her voice soared, and when it was over, the spectators at the Staples Center sprang to their feet. Welcome back, Demi. Tributes reign It was tribute night at the Grammys, which featured an emotional musical homage to the late rapper Nipsey Hussle from artists including DJ Khaled, John Legend and Meek Mill. Hussle, an Eritrean-American who was born Ermias Asghedom – was shot dead last March, triggering an outpouring of grief in Los Angeles and among his superstar peers.  The tribute included a rendition of ""Higher,"" Hussle's Grammy-winning song with Khaled and Legend, which they performed with a gospel choir as projections of the rapper's image alongside that of Bryant presided over the stage. Bryant, who died tragically in a helicopter crash Sunday morning, January 26, also got a shout-out from one of the night's brightest stars Lizzo, who kicked off Grammy night by laying down the evening's theme: ""Tonight is for Kobe."" Usher, donning a sparkling jacket and tight pants delivered a musical love letter to Prince, as FKA Twigs impressed with a pole dance. The late pop icon's protegee Sheila E shimmered in a glittery green pantsuit as she banged out drum solos. And veteran rockers Aerosmith added to the nostalgia with a medley of their greatest hits including ""Walk This Way."" Rap act Run-DMC joined them onstage, where another Bryant jersey waved – another wordless tribute to the legendary Laker. – Rappler.com "

In its early years, Dinagyang was a parish celebration where natives covered in ash danced in the streets, adopting the Ati-Atihan of Aklan. Now in its 52nd year, the celebration has evolved to feature joyous performers in colorful costumes, dancing to the beat of the drums while chanting ""Hala Bira"" with the crowd.   The annual Ilonggo festival is celebrated every 4th Sunday of January as a way to honor the Holy Child Jesus, referred to as Señor Sto Niño. Dinagyang Festival is a mixture of culture and religion. Among the common themes of the performances during Dinagyang are the pagan rituals of the Ati tribe and the introduction of Catholicism, represented by relics of Señor Sto Niño in all forms and sizes. Iloilo Festivals Foundation Inc (IFFI), a new group of organizers, handled this year's Dinagyang Festival with the aim of reining back the focus of the festival to the faith and devotion of the Ilonggos. (READ: Devotee for 40 years: Iloilo's faithful steward is Dinagyang's hermana mayor)   The word ""dinagyang"" comes from the Hiligaynon term ""dagyang"" which means merrymaking. During the festival, revelers flock to the streets of Iloilo to dance, listen to local music, and relish the company of people from different cultures. The highlight of the monthlong Dinagyang Festival is the Ati Tribe dance competition, where students form school-based tribes and conduct theatrical street performances. This year's theme was ""Perfect Vision: Celebrating the Ilonggo Spirit in Honor of Señor Sto Niño."" Hoping to change things up, IFFI set up an arena-type presentation of the tribe dances, giving the audience a 360-degree view of the performances during the Ati Tribe dance competition.   There were 4 stations where revelers can witness performances from every angle: the Iloilo Freedom Grandstand, Iznart-Solis Street, Valeria-Ledesma Street, and Iloilo Central Market. Besting 7 other contingents, Tribu Paghidaet of La Paz National High School took home the top prize with their performance showing the evolution of faith in the island – from folk healing traditions to faithfulness to the Sto Niño. Trailing after Tribu Paghidaet was Tribu Panayanon with their vibrant take on the conversion of the Ati tribe to Christianity through Sto Niño, as they gave thanks for their bountiful harvest. Meanwhile, Tribu Ilonganon of Jalandoni Memorial National High School and Tribu Salognon of Jaro National High School took 3rd and 4th place, respectively. Tribu Dagatnon, with their performance depicting Ati healers and their rituals, got 5th place. Here are some photos of this year's Dinagyang Festival:               – Rappler.com Carl Don S.

This file photo shows US soldiers and their Filipino counterparts joining forces in an Amphibious Landing operation as part of the 2015 Balikatan Exercises made possible by the VFA. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo downplayed the possibility of the United States terminating other military treaties with the Philippines, following the Duterte government's efforts to start the process of terminating the two countries' Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Panelo said the Duterte administration was not concerned with such a fallout when asked to comment on how the Philippines would respond if the US terminated the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) – the operational aspect of the VFA – and the overarching Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). ""That's in the realm of speculation. I think the treaties benefit more the Unite d States than the Philippines. Strategically, the US needs to be in almost every part of the world to secure itself from its perceived enemies,"" Panelo told reporters on Monday, January 27. On Thursday, January 23, President Rodrigo Duterte warned the US government he would scrap the VFA if it failed to ""correct"" the cancelled visa of his former police chief and now Senator Ronald dela Rosa. A day after, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr announced he would ""start the process"" of terminating the VFA. The VFA, ratified by the Philippine Senate in 1999, outlined guidelines for the conduct of American troops visiting the Philippines and is the foundation for military exercises between the Philippines and the US. It was an affirmation of the Philippines and US' obligations under the 1951 MDT, which is the Philippines and US' commitment to defend each other in case of an attack. The Aquino-time EDCA, which provided for increased military presence of the US in the Philippines, operationalized the VFA. 'Tactical, thinking President' Panelo refuted criticism that Duterte's decision was rash and disproportionate to the US' cancellation of Dela Rosa's visa, insisting it was a ""studied response"" from a ""tactical and thinking"" President. Aside from Dela Rosa's cancelled visa, Panelo said among the reasons Duterte renewed threats to scrap the VFA was his anger over US lawmakers' efforts to sanction Philippine officials involved in extrajudicial killings and the detention of Senator Leila de Lima. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra earlier told reporters Malacañang ordered a ""preliminary impact assessment on the possible termination of the VFA,"" expanding the scope of the justice department's initial study on the matter.

Vivencio Manguiat, 63, is one of them. He recalled how many people died over 5 decades ago because they had no access to information and knew about the eruption too late. “Ang ikinamatay ng iba ay sa pagputok ng bulkan, ang iba naman ay sa kanilang pangangagaw nila sa kanilang sasakyan, ang [sumakay sa] bangka ay nagdamihan na hanggang sa nalubog ang bangka,” said Manguiat.

Manguiat said that unlike the situation in 1965, people knew what to do when the Taal Volcano began erupting on Sunday afternoon, January 12. Thanks to the blow-by-blow updates on mainstream media as well as on social media, people were able to safely evacuate from the island. “May alam ang mga tao sa sitwasyon ng bulkan so hindi sila nag-papanic. Nalaman agad nila kung ano ang gagawin, hindi katulad noong dati na wala talaga (People had an idea of what was going on with the Taal Volcano so they didn’t panic. They already knew what to do, unlike before, [they knew] none at all),” he said. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) has been monitoring the Taal Volcano since its state of unrest on January 12. Phivolcs is using two networks to monitor volcanic earthquakes – the Philippine Seismic Network which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former. In 1965, Taal Volcano erupted at Mt Tabaro, leaving 200 dead. The eruption was phreatomagmatic and violent, characterized by falling rock fragments, ashfall with 25-centimeter thick deposit, and acid rain. (READ: TIMELINE: Taal Volcano eruptions since 1572) Homecoming to uncertainty While the 2020 Taal Volcano eruption recorded few casualties, many people lost their homes and livelihood, just like in 1965. “Kaya lang ang problema ‘yung kanilang mga bahay na iniwan doon at hayop ay talagang nawala. Ang mga bahay nila natakluban ng buhangin. '’Yun ngang Taal Volcano naging disyerto na. Wala ka nang makikitang bahay, wala ka nang makikitang punong kahoy puro akala mo ay buhangin,” Manguiat said. (The problem now is they lost their homes and their livestock. Their houses are all covered in ash. The volcano island is like a dessert. You cannot see the houses and the trees anymore, just ash.) With the Taal eruption threat level downgraded to Alert Level 3, people could return to their homes. Manguiat was asked for his message to the national government as evacuees, especially those who have nothing to return to, start to rebuild their lives. “Ang mensahe ko lang ay sa aming pag-uwi, kami ay may i-uuwi na pagdating sa bahay ay may makakakain dahil kami po ay hindi pa gasino makakapaghanapbuhay. Kaya ayun po ang tanging mahihiling ko sa gobyerno natin na kami ay masuportahan,” he said. (My only message to the government is when we return to our homes, we would bring home something so that once we're home, we would ahve something to eat as we haven't gone back to work yet. That’s all I ask from the government, that they support us.) In a press briefing on Sunday, January 26, Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas said thousands of houses were damaged by the Taal eruption, and advised residents not to return to the hard-hit communities. Mandanas said the provincial government was planning the resettlement of affected residents. He said the initial estimate is 22,000 new homes for resettlement. (LOOK: Eyed relocation site for Taal evacuees in Ibaan, Batangas) He said a resettlement area had been identified, but work was still being done on the roads, power and water supply.

It’s quite an absurd and novel comedic spectacle that everything else just feels second-rate and standard. The sad thing here is that the gag are no longer a surprise. They are used as a come-on to get kids interested enough in a cartoonic James Bond-esque adventure fueled not by manly thrills and tension but by cuteness and color. That the humor’s no longer a surprise, however, shouldn’t stop parents from having their kids sift through the regurgitated jokes to uncover a pacifist core that in this age of unadulterated violence. is quite special. Spies in Disguise, while obviously catering to a market of toddlers who’d easily be amused with a bunch of baddies turning soft with the sight of adorable kittens, is bolstered by a statement that is much-needed in a world that is festering in division. Sure, there are moments of violence such as when the main characters fall from a high rise or bumping their heads and bodies on walls and ceilings, but those slapstick antics are meant for chuckles, and not to instill a dangerous message that pain and brutality are alright. The film’s still defiantly a cartoon that endeavors to tickle less sophisticated taste buds. It is its underlying heart that differentiates it from its immature ilk.  GENIUS. Walter (voiced by Tom Holland) shows his gadgets to Lance. Irresistible rapport It certainly helps that Smith and Holland have irresistible rapport. Their banter, which comprises majority of the film’s dialogue, is amusing. Holland’s geekiness provides ample heart and soul to Smith’s trademark coolness. The arguments are never distracting, as they make most of the reliable tropes that have made the odd couple genre a hit. There is nothing truly special about the film’s look. It is standard Blue Sky fare – unsurprisingly glossy, vibrant and at times, boring. There are times that the cartoon wows with colors, such as in the opening where a fight scene set in Japan blossoms into a dazzlingly hued tableau that seems ripped off from Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill series.

""At around 1:10 pm (0840 GMT) a plane crashed in Deh Yak district of Ghazni province. The plane is on fire and the villagers are trying to put it out. We still don't know if it is a military or commercial plane,"" Aref Noori, Ghazni's governor's spokesman, told AFP. A police spokesman in the province also confirmed the crash but was also unable to identify the craft. Large swathes of the rural areas in Ghazni province are controlled or under the influence of Taliban militants making access to the area difficult for officials. Social media was rife with suggestions that the plane was from the state-owned Ariana Afghan Airlines – however the company said the rumours were ""not true"". ""All the flights of Ariana Afghan Airlines have been completed normally,"" a statement on the carrier's verified Facebook page read. Crashes involving military flights, particularly helicopters, are common in Afghanistan where inclement weather and creaky aircraft are often pressed to their limits in the war-torn country where insurgents have been known to target helicopters. The last civilian flight to crash was in May 2010, when an ageing Pamir Airways plane went down in bad weather during a scheduled flight to Kabul from the northern province of Kunduz. It was carrying six crew and 38 passengers when it crashed into a mountainside 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Kabul. – Rappler.com "

In this file photo taken on March 5, 2019 Football Leaks whistleblower Rui Pinto is escorted by judicial officers as he arrives at the Metropolitan Court in Budapest, Hungary, for his trial. Photo by Ferenc Isza/AFP LISBON, Portugal – Lawyers for a Portuguese computer hacker said on Monday, January 27, he was responsible for revealing the dealings of Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, a corruption scandal with fallout across Europe and Africa. The hacker, Rui Pinto, handed over a hard drive ""containing all data related to the recent revelations concerning Ms. Isabel Dos Santos’s fortune"" to a whistleblowing organisation in 2018, his lawyers said. (READ: Document trove shows how 'Africa's richest woman' stole fortune – ICIJ) The tycoon daughter of former Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos now faces a slew of corruption allegations stretching across Angola's state oil and diamond industries and banks – all of which she has denied in interviews from London. Rui Pinto – described by his lawyers as a ""very important European whistleblower"" – is also behind the so-called Football Leaks, a series of stories about financial dealings and transfers involving clubs in Europe's top leagues. The football revelations, which first appeared in 2015 and were eventually published in Germany's Spiegel and other European outlets, sparked criminal investigations in countries including Britain and France. Pinto, 31, was extradited from Hungary last March over allegations that he hacked into the systems of investment fund Doyen Sports and tried to blackmail them in return for not publishing information he had taken. His lawyers have argued that Pinto – currently in pretrial detention in Portugal – willingly stopped the blackmail attempt and turned whistleblower, publishing the documents rather than profiting personally. But a Portuguese court decided on January 17 to go ahead with his trial on a total of 90 charges. 'Broken system' According to his lawyers, the hard drive Pinto handed over on the Angolan tycoon's finances provided the source material for revelations about ""all the actors that might be involved in the fraudulent operations committed at the expense of the Angolan State"". The New York-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) -- which had also worked on previous financial scandals including the 2016 ""Panama Papers"" -- began publishing stories on dos Santos in mid-January. The consortium said it had trawled more than 715,000 files and produced stories it said revealed a ""broken international regulatory system"". Within days, Angola's prosecutors announced charges against dos Santos, as the so-called Luanda Leaks scandal swirled around allegations that she had syphoned off hundreds of millions of dollars of public money into offshore accounts during her tenure at Sonangol, Angola's state-owned oil giant. Hundreds of companies, many based in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands, are alleged to have helped dos Santos accrue her fortune. A Portuguese banker who worked for Eurobic -- in which dos Santos is the main shareholder -- was found dead last week in an apparent suicide. He was named in the Luanda Leaks documents and later described in media reports as her account manager. Pinto had forwarded the hard drive to the Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa and the ICIJ, his lawyers said. He had ""sought to help understanding complex operations conducted with the complicity of banks and jurists which not only impoverish the people and the State of Angola, but may have seriously damaged Portugal’s general interest"", the statement said. Angolans call Isabel dos Santos ""the princess"", and she is Africa's richest woman according to Forbes, which estimates her assets at $2.1 billion. – Rappler.com "

Nick Kyrgios pays tribute to late NBA great Kobe Bryant before facing Rafael Nadal in the Australian Open. Photo by Saeed Khan/AFP MELBOURNE, Australia – World No. 1 Rafael Nadal weathered a fierce storm from gutsy showman Nick Kyrgios Monday, January 27, to set up an Australian Open quarterfinal against Dominic Thiem and keep alive his quest for a 20th Grand Slam title. The Spanish top seed came through a riveting clash at the Rod Laver Arena, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (8/6), 7-6 (7/4), to end the gallant hopes of the basketball-mad Australian, who came on court wearing a Los Angeles Lakers jersey in honor of Kobe Bryant. He will now face 5th seed Thiem after the Austrian swept past Gael Monfils 6-2, 6-4, 6-4. ""What can I say about Nick? When he is playing like today with this positive attitude, he gives a lot of positive things to our sport,"" said Nadal, the 2009 champion who is looking to match Roger Federer's record 20 Slam crowns. ""He's one of the highest talents we have on our tour and I like the Nick Kyrgios during the whole of this tournament."" ""I just feel happy that I won one more match tonight, an important one,"" he added. It was billed as a grudge match after a series of bad-tempered exchanges last year when Nadal accused Kyrgios of lacking respect and the Australian fired back that the Spaniard was ""super salty."" But Kyrgios struck a conciliatory tone beforehand, calling Nadal ""a hell of a player,"" and it was played with respect from both sides. There was little to split them on paper, with Nadal leading their career head-to-head 4-3 but Kyrgios 2-1 up on hardcourts and an even 1-1 in their Grand Slam matches, both at Wimbledon. The second of those, last year, was a torrid affair, with Kyrgios ranting at the umpire, serving underarm, and deliberately firing a forehand at the Spaniard. The Australian walked out on Rod Laver Arena wearing a yellow Bryant singlet as a mark of respect to the legend who tragically died in a helicopter crash, while a short video tribute was shown. Both held their opening service games before Nadal got a break in game 4. He was reading Kyrgios' monster serve well and getting returns back over the net. Kyrgios began talking to himself, never a good sign so early in the match, and with Nadal too strong from the back of the court, he comfortably took the set. But the Australian calmed down and crucially held his opening 2nd set service game in a 10-minute slog, and as his boisterous fans got behind him, he broke Nadal with a looping forehand, punching the air in delight for a 3-1 lead. Feeding off the crowd energy, he sealed the set with an ace. Kyrgios was enjoying himself, grinning, and applauding Nadal as the pair played some mesmerizing rallies in a high-quality 3rd set. But he began unravelling at 6-5 down, becoming irritated with a line judge and telling the umpire: ""We're giving 130 percent and he can't get line calls right. It's embarrassing."" And when Kyrgios went 3-1 down in the tie-breaker, he slammed his racket, leaving it a mangled mess. Then at 5-5 in the tie-break, Kyrgios double faulted, giving Nadal a set point. In bizarre scenes, the Spaniard responded by double faulting himself before finally taking the set, furiously pumping his fists. Kyrgios appeared spent and was broken to love for Nadal to take 2-1 lead in the 4th set, where the Spaniard appeared headed for the finish line. But he amazingly sent down a double fault when serving for the match to give Kyrgios a break point and it again went to a tie-break before Nadal finally sealed the victory. – Rappler.com "

Several residents have opted to stay at evacuation centers even afer the Batangas provincial government has announced they can go home. Photo by Charles Salazar/Rappler BATANGAS, Philippines – Many residents affected by the Taal Volcano eruption were grateful for the donations they got, but more than the relief packs, they said they need cash to start anew. Emelita Begornia, 67, walked around the Batangas City Sports Complex clutching a bible in her bag. ""Kahit isang singkong duling, wala!,"" Begornia said. (I don't have a single cent.) Begornia, a resident of the municipality of Taal, came to Batangas City with her 4 daughters, all single mothers, and her 12 grandchildren, to seek refuge from the restive volcano on January 12. The relief goods were more than enough, she said, but their house needed repairs. Staying more than two weeks at the evacuation center, her family didn't have any income. ""Ang gusto ko, [tulong] pinansiyal. Ang aking [bahay] ay kahit gay'on ay nakatindig pa rin, pero puro crack,"" Begornia said. (What I want is financial aid. My house is still standing, but it has a lot of cracks.) Begornia is not an isolated case. When Taal Volcano started erupting on January 12, more than 500 earthquakes followed. The groundshaking has damaged thousands of homes. Marissa Parcon, 60, is worried not just about a house full of cracks but also her son's livelihood. The breadwinner, Parcon's son is a cement mixer, but there were no construction projects because of the volcanic eruption. ""Siyempre, pagdating po ninyo [sa bahay] ay wala po kayong makuk’wan. Eh ’yun pong kukunin pa’ng aming bahay, at ’yung ang aming mga pagkain, wala po kaming hanapbuhay. ’Yun pong aming kailangang-kailangan talaga po’y pinansiyal [na tulong],"" Parcon said. (Of course, when we got back, we don't have anything. We need to spend for our house and our food, but we don't have livelihood now. We really need financial aid.) President Rodrigo Duterte planned to kas Congress for a P30-billion supplemental budget for the rehabilitation of the affected areas. From the proposed supplemental budget, Senator Risa Hontiveros has urged the government to provide at least P30,000 in cash aid to Taal Volcano eruption survivors. She said the amount should be regarded as an ""initial assistance"" to evacuees, pending a complete post-disaster assessment. (LIST: Relief proposals for Taal Volcano evacuees) ""Hindi naman kami nahingi ng malaking halaga. Kung ano'ng 'pagkaloob sa amin,"" Begornia said. (We're not asking for a huge amount. Any amount will do.) Better safe than sorry Several residents have gone back to their homes on Sunday, January 26, as state volcanologists lowered Taal Volcano's status to Alert Level 3. But many Batangueños opted to stay at evacuation centers, fearing that the alert level might be raised again to 4. Marivic Cuarto, 48, said they would rather not return to their house in Kawit, Taal, given the threat. She said that they didn't own a vehicle to rush back to evacuation centers should the inevitable happen. ""Kaya kami nagpilit na na'ndito pa po, ano po, may bata pong maliit.

(We're staying here because my grandchildren are still small. I have another grandchild there who is only 6 days old. What if Taal Volcano erupts again, how can we flee?)

A human chain and candlelight protest is staged by rights groups in Quezon City to condemn the violence in Negros province. File photo by Maria Tan/Rappler BACOLOD CITY, Philippines – The Senate panels which jointly looked into the series of killings in the provinces of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental have recommended that policemet, soldiers in the army, and a local anti-communist vigilante group be investigated for possible liabilities. Senate Committee Report No. 33 was prepared by the committee on public order and dangerous drugs chaired by Senator Ronald dela Rosa, and the committee on justice and human rights chaired by Senator Richard Gordon. The report urged the Philippine National Police (PNP) Internal Affairs Services to determine whether police personnel and units involved in Oplan Sauron committed abuses or violated laws or the Revised Police Operational Procedures. They may face administrative and criminal liabilities. The report also recommended that the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) investigate personnel involved in Oplan Sauron for possible human rights abuses or violations of law. “The series of killings seems to follow a crooked pattern. Unarmed civilians, peasants, human rights defenders, church workers, and even members of the police force who go after insurgents are likewise targeted and are murdered,” the Senate report pointed out. (LOOK: MAP: Negros killings since July 2016) “No one was spared — men, women, and children suffered at the hands of lawless armed men,” the report said. (READ: Death comes unprovoked upon Negros Island) The panels stressed that between October 2018 and July 2019, a series of killings and attempted killings took place in the two provinces of Negros Island. The cases included 9 farmers, who were shot to death by unidentified armed men in Sagay City, Negros Occidental, on October 20, 2018. The Senate report pointed out that during the 8-month period between the launch of the Simultaneous Enhanced Managing of Police Operations on December 27, 2018, and of its second version, Oplan Sauron, on March 30, 2019, killings on the island escalated. The “dreadful episodes of carnage and violence, however, continued to hound the terrorized Negros Islands,” the report stressed. (READ: TIMELINE: Killings in Negros) Six people died while 31 were arrested in the simultaneous police operations on December 27, 2018. On March 30, 2019, during the wee hours, 14 people were killed in the raids. The 14 victims, who were suspected members of the New People's Army, allegedly resisted arrest as cops served search warrants for illegal possession of firearms and explosives. The families of the victims, however, insisted that the cops, who reportedly wore bonnets, still executed the victims even if they had already yielded to them. They also noted irregularities in the raids. In the Senate report, the joint panels stressed that one important angle that must not be ignored is the possible abuses that might have been committed by the members of the military and the police in implementing ""all necessary measures to suppress any and all forms of lawless violence"" in the affected provinces. The Senate also asked the PNP and AFP to review, evaluate, and report to the President the effectiveness of Oplan Sauron vis-a-vis the objective to suppress and end lawless violence in the Negros Island.

Police officers and security guards stand outside the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market where the coronavirus was detected in Wuhan on January 24, 2020 File photo by Hector Retamal/AFP WUHAN, China (UPDATED) – China's capital on Monday, January 27, recorded its first death from a deadly coronavirus as it struggles to contain a rapidly spreading disease that has sparked global alarm, with countries scrambling to evacuate their citizens from the epicenter of the epidemic. The death in Beijing raises the death toll from the new virus to 82, with more than 2,700 people infected across the nation and cases found in more than a dozen other countries. Mongolia closed its vast border to vehicles from China while Germany urged its citizens to avoid travelling to the country and Malaysia banned people from central Hubei province, where the pneumonia-like virus emerged, from entering its soil. In a sign of the mounting official concern, Premier Li Keqiang visited ground zero to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the disease first appeared late last month. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, effectively trapping tens of millions of people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the Lunar New Year holiday unfolds. The Communist government decided to extend the holiday, initially due to end on January 30, for 3 days to limit population flows and control the epidemic. US President Donald Trump said the United States has offered China ""any help that is necessary"" in combatting the virus. Beijing's health commission said a 50 year-old-man who visited Wuhan died of respiratory failure on Monday, January 27, only 20 days after visiting the city. More than 700 new infections were confirmed in the country, while the number of suspected cases doubled over a 24-hour period to nearly 6,000. The youngest infected patient was a 9-month-old baby being treated in Beijing. In Wuhan, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reporters saw construction workers making progress in the building of one of two field hospitals that China is racing to complete by next week to relieve overcrowded facilities swamped with people waiting hours to see doctors. On day 5 under quarantine, residents shouted ""Go Wuhan"" from their windows, according to videos posted online, and AFP journalists saw a building with the words lit up in red in front of the Yangtze river. ""I'm getting more concerned every day,"" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP. Global fears spread Landlocked Mongolia, which is heavily dependent on trade with China, closed the border with its huge neighbor to cars. Mongolian schools and universities will be shut until March 2, while public gatherings involving sports and entertainment are also suspended. Malaysia banned visitors from Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province. Turkey advised its citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China altogether. In Germany, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the government was holding crisis talks with health experts to discuss the spread of the virus. ""Travelers should consider delaying or cancelling any unnecessary trips to China,"" Maas said. A US-bound flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens. France plans to fly citizens out of the city in the middle of this week. Japan will also bring its citizens home. Belgium, Bangladesh, India and Spain said they were working to repatriate their nationals, while Germany was considering the possibility. The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted international trade or travel restrictions. But the world body said Monday that the global risk from the deadly virus in China was ""high,"" admitting an error in its previous reports that said it was ""moderate."" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus headed to Beijing for discussions with Chinese officials. Global stock markets and oil prices plunged Monday over coronavirus fears. China shuts down The virus is believed to have jumped to people from animals in a Wuhan market that sold a wide range of exotic wild game. China on Sunday, January 26, banned all wildlife trade until the emergency subsides. The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. Authorities around China have already imposed aggressive curbs on transport during the usually high-traffic Lunar New Year season to keep the virus from spreading. At Beijing's main international airport, almost all passengers wear masks. Fever checks are conducted at subway and railway stations. Typically, hundreds of millions of people criss-cross China in jam-packed buses and trains during the holiday, a time for family reunions. But the festivities have been ruined this year by coronavirus, which can be transmitted between humans, with people told to avoid gatherings. Countless popular public attractions and seasonal festivals have been shut down. Several Beijing malls shortened their opening hours, according to state media. The nationwide measures threaten to put a dent in an economy that was already slowing down. Beijing and Shanghai were among places mandating stringent checks and 14-day observation periods for people arriving from Hubei. Wuhan's mayor Zhou Xianwang said around 5 million people had left the stricken city during the new year travel rush in January, highlighting fears the virus could spread further. – Rappler.com "

In a purported audio message by its spokesman Abu Hamza al-Quraishi, the jihadist organization called for sabotaging a so-called peace plan US President Donald Trump is due to unveil. The spokesman said ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi encourages the group's fighters to launch ""a new phase"" and vowed major operations against Israel. ""The eyes of the soldiers of the caliphate, wherever they are, are still on Jerusalem,"" the spokesman said in the 37-minute message. ""And in the coming days, God willing, you will see what harms you and what will make you forget the horrors you have seen,"" Abu Hamza al-Quraishi said, apparently threatening attacks of unprecedented scope. Agence France-Presse could not immediately authenticate the message but the recording was published via the group's usual social media channels. The jihadist organization once administered a sprawling self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" straddling big parts of Syria and Iraq, where it minted a currency, levied taxes and ran school curricula. Under pressure from combined military operations by Syrian and Iraqi forces supported by their respective allies, the proto-state collapsed last year. Trump plan ISIS has remained a potent outfit in its Euphrates heartland and surrounding desert hideouts however and its franchises in Africa and Asia have also continued to expand their attacks. The group also has a presence in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, which borders Israel and which the Jewish state occupied for 15 years after the 1967 war. The spokesman said ISIS leader Quraishi was ""determined, and has encouraged his mujahideen brothers in all provinces, and Muslims across the world,"" to launch ""a new phase."" That new focus ""is fighting the Jews and reclaiming what they have stolen from the Muslims, and this cannot be reclaimed except through fighting,"" he said. Trump was from Monday, January 27, hosting both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the premier's rival Benny Gantz in Washington ahead of unveiling his ""peace plan."" The ISIS spokesman made a direct reference to the ""Trump plan,"" which has already been rejected by the Palestinians, who ironically call it the ""Deal of the Century."" ""To Muslims in Palestine and across the world...be the warhead in fighting Jews and foil the so-called 'Deal of the Century',"" Abu Hamza al-Quraishi said. He urged ISIS fighters, especially those in Syria and Sinai, to turn Jewish settlements into ""a testing ground"" for their weapons. Some 600,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem among around 2.9 million Palestinians. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and annexed the territory in 1981. On its southern coast, Israel imposes a crippling blockade on the Palestinian territory of Gaza, a strip which is controlled by the Islamist movement Hamas and shares a border with Egypt's Sinai region. Since coming to office, Trump has already gifted Netanyahu – who is running for re-election – a number of political presents. These include breaking with diplomatic consensus to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and ending US opposition to settlements. – Rappler.com "

Britain's Prince Andrew, Duke of York (L) denies meeting Virginia Roberts, one of disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein's alleged victims. AFP file photo NEW YORK, USA – Prince Andrew has given ""zero cooperation"" to the FBI in its investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, despite publicly offering his assistance, a US prosecutor said Monday, January 27. The British royal denies claims he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured by Epstein and said in November he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."" But New York attorney Geoffrey Berman, who is leading an investigation into possible co-conspirators of the disgraced US financier, said Andrew was yet to respond to a request by the FBI and his office for an interview. ""To date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation,"" Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, told reporters. Berman gave the comments during a news conference outside Epstein's former Manhattan mansion, which Andrew has admitted staying at. He said he would not normally comment on whether individuals were cooperating but made an exception for the prince because of his statement offering help. ""It's fair for people to know whether Prince Andrew has followed through with that public commitment,"" said Berman. Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to request for comment. Queen Elizabeth II's second son stepped back from frontline royal duties after he faced outrage over an interview with the BBC late last year in which he defended his friendship with Epstein. Andrew, 59, also denied having sexual relations with Virginia Giuffre, who alleges she was trafficked to have sex with friends of Epstein when she was 17. Epstein, 66, killed himself in a New York jail in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. He was a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager who befriended countless celebrities over the years, including US President Donald Trump. Epstein was charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and another of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. He denied the charges but was facing up to 45 years in jail if found guilty. 'Ill-judged association' Determined to obtain justice despite his death, dozens of women who say they were abused by Epstein have sued his estate and prosecutors have pledged to pursue any accomplices. ""Jeffrey Epstein couldn't have done what he did without the assistance of others and I can assure you that our investigation is moving forward,"" Berman said Monday. Giuffre says she had sex with the prince at the central London home of Epstein's socialite girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001. In what proved to be a disastrous BBC interview, Andrew said he did not remember meeting Giuffre and that he ""absolutely and categorically"" did not have sex with her. Afterwards he issued a statement in which he said ""I... unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein."" While Epstein's death has been ruled a suicide – with two prison guards charged for alleged failure to monitor him – it has also fueled conspiracy theories, mostly speculating he was murdered to stop him revealing compromising information about wealthy acquaintances. Several of Epstein's accusers have said Maxwell recruited them to provide sexual favors for Epstein and some of his associates. Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of paying young girls for massages but served just 13 months in jail under a secret plea deal struck with the then state prosecutor. – Rappler.com "

We have to leave compassion,” Amer said. “We have to realize that in an effort to leave empathy out, we are at war and that the people we are competing with see the rule of the game the same way they do....

Passengers wearing protective facemasks to help stop the spread of a deadly SARS-like virus which originated in the central city of Wuhan arrive at Beijing railway station in Beijing on January 24, 2020. Photo by Noel Celis/AFP GENEVA, Switzerland – The World Health Organization said Monday, January 27, it remained unclear if the deadly coronavirus spreading in China and beyond is contagious during its incubation period, before symptoms appear. The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has in a matter of weeks killed more than 80 people and infected some 2,740 in China, while cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries. In a fresh report on the new virus, known as 2019nCoV, the UN health agency said current estimates put the incubation period for the virus at between two and 10 days. ""Understanding the time when infected patients may transmit the virus to others is critical for control efforts,"" WHO said. It did not immediately confirm assertions made by Chinese authorities that people who are infected can spread the disease before they show any symptoms of fever or respiratory difficulties. ""Detailed epidemiological information from more people infected is needed to determine the infectious period of 2019nCoV, in particular whether transmission can occur from asymptomatic individuals or during the incubation period,"" it said. WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern – a rare designation used only for the worst outbreaks that would trigger more concerted global action. But the world body admitted Monday it had made an error in its risk assessment for the deadly virus in several reports last week, acknowledging the global risk was ""high"" rather than ""moderate."" The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. The new virus is believed to have jumped to people from animals in a Wuhan market, but it has since begun spreading between humans, although the exact mode of transmission has yet to be confirmed. As with SARS and another deadly coronavirus known as Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, WHO suggested that the new virus could be spreading through droplets, for instance when people sneeze or cough, or through direct contact with infected people or with objects they have touched. To reduce the risk of infection, WHO stressed the need to avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequently wash one's hands, and avoid unprotected contact with farm or wild animals. The agency also stressed the importance of practicing so-called cough etiquette, including maintaining distance and covering coughs and sneezes with tissues. WHO has not recommended any international travel or trade restrictions, but does call for high levels of vigilance, including encouraging airport exit and entry screening for passengers leaving affected areas to check for fever and coughs. – Rappler.com "

The Staples Center matchup, which had been set to be the first NBA game on the Lakers' home court since Lakers legend Bryant died in a helicopter crash Sunday, will be rescheduled at a later date. ""The decision was made out of respect for the Lakers organization, which is deeply grieving the tragic loss,"" the NBA said in announcing the postponement. The next scheduled Lakers game is on Friday at Staples Center against Portland.

Had so many great convos about so many things and I will cherish those moments forever. Love you forever, Bean!"" Bryant, his daughter Gianna and 7 other people were killed in the crash in the suburban Los Angeles hills near Calabasas, California. An outpouring of grief from fans and athletes worldwide has included thousands in Los Angeles who have gathered outside the arena and left items in tribute to Bryant, who retired in 2016 after 20 seasons with the Lakers. Bryant is considered by many the most outstanding athlete from any LA sports team. The Lakers own the second-best record in the NBA at 36-10, the best mark in the Western Conference.

In this file photo taken on March 16, 2019, former US vice president Joe Biden speaks during the First State Democratic Dinner in Dover, Delaware. Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – US President Donald Trump's lawyers on Monday, January 27, defended his request that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, arguing at his Senate impeachment trial that it was motivated by concerns about corruption. Pam Bondi, the Republican former attorney general of Florida, and another Trump lawyer, Eric Herschmann, launched a concerted attack on the Bidens as they sought to defend the president's actions to the 100 senators who will decide his fate. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives impeached Trump on December 18 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for withholding military aid to Ukraine to pressure Kiev to open a probe into the Bidens. (READ: Top Trump ally admits tying Ukraine aid to Biden investigation) During a July 25 phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to ""look into"" Joe Biden, his potential November election rival, and Hunter Biden, who served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Democratic prosecutors said the request by the president was not motivated by concern about corruption but rather was designed to smear a political rival and allow him to win re-election. Displaying bank records, Bondi said Hunter Biden had been paid ""millions"" of dollars to serve on the Burisma board while his father was Barack Obama's vice president. ""If your last name wasn't Biden do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of Burisma?"" she asked. ""I don't know, probably not."" She cited remarks from a State Department official who expressed concerns in 2015, when Biden was vice president, that the appointment could create the ""perception of a conflict of interest."" Bondi also noted that Burisma had been the target of persistent corruption allegations. She said Trump was within his rights to raise his concerns and that the House Democratic prosecutors known as managers had declined to present all of the facts surrounding Burisma and the Bidens. ""You've heard from the House managers they do not believe that there was any concern to raise here, that all of this was baseless,"" Bondi said. ""And all we are saying is that there was a basis to talk about this, to raise this issue."" 'No expertise or experience' Like Bondi, Herschmann attacked Hunter Biden's credentials for serving on the Burisma board. ""He had no expertise or experience in the natural gas industry,"" Herschmann said. ""He had no known expertise in corporate governance, nor any expertise in Ukrainian law. ""So why did Burisma want Hunter Biden on its board?"" he asked. ""Well, he did have one qualification – he was the son of the man in charge of the Ukrainian portfolio."" There have been no accusations of criminal wrongdoing against the Bidens and Hunter Biden defended his appointment to the Burisma board in an interview last year with ABC News. ""I was vice chairman of the board of Amtrak for 5 years,"" he said of the US railroad company. ""I was the chairman of the board of the UN World Food Program. I was a lawyer for Boies Schiller Flexner, one of the most prestigious law firms in the world."" Hunter Biden did acknowledge, however, that taking the Burisma position may have been a mistake. ""In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,"" he said.

637,250360,"January 28, 2020",US & Canada,Ken Starr defends Trump amid Bolton's explosive revelations,Agence France-Presse,"'Like war, impeachment is hell,' Starr tells the 100 senators who will decide Trump's fate. 'At least presidential impeachment is hell.'  DEFENSE. Kenneth Starr, counsel to the President, speaking in the Senate Chamber at the US Capitol during the impeachment trial, on January 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. Photo by HO/US Senate TV/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – Pressure mounted on Republicans on Monday, January 27 to call former national security advisor John Bolton as a witness at Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial following explosive new revelations about the US president's dealings with Ukraine. As Clinton impeachment investigator Ken Starr resumed the White House defense of Trump on the Senate floor, at least 3 Republican senators indicated they would favor hearing testimony from the 71-year-old Bolton. According to The New York Times, Bolton, in a draft of his upcoming book, says that Trump told him in August that he wanted to freeze military aid to Ukraine until Kiev opened an investigation into his potential November election rival Joe Biden. The allegation that Trump withheld the aid for his own political purposes is at the heart of Trump's impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Four Republicans would need to join forces with Democrats in the Senate – where Republicans hold a 53 to 47 seat edge – to allow testimony from Bolton and other witnesses sought by Democrats. Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah said he believed there may be enough Republican backing to compel Bolton to testify. ""It's increasingly apparent that it would be important to hear from John Bolton,"" Romney told reporters. ""I think it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton."" Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine, said the Bolton reports ""strengthen the case for witnesses."" Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, said she has always been ""curious as to what John Bolton might have to say."" Chief Democratic prosecutor Adam Schiff welcomed the news that Republicans were considering calling Bolton to testify at what is just the third impeachment trial of a president in US history. ""You can't have a trial, a meaningful trial, without witnesses and you certainly can't have one without John Bolton,"" Schiff said. ""Senators should not wait until March 17 when the book comes out. They should demand this information while it would still be pertinent to their decision."" While just 51 senators are required to allow further trial witnesses, 67 senators – a two-thirds majority – are needed to remove Trump from office. 'Age of impeachment' Trump lashed out at Bolton on Twitter, denying he had ever told his former aide that military assistance to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating Biden or his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. ""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,"" Trump said. ""In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book."" Speaking later to reporters, Trump said he had not yet seen the manuscript, which was submitted to the White House last month for security clearance. The White House began its defense presentation on Monday with a historical overview of past impeachments from Starr, whose investigation led to the 1998 impeachment of president Bill Clinton. ""The Senate is being called to sit as the high court of impeachment all too frequently,"" Starr said. ""Indeed we're living in what I think can be aptly described as the age of impeachment."" Starr argued that efforts to remove Trump from office were unconstitutional because unlike in the cases of Clinton and former presidents Richard Nixon the articles of impeachment did not allege any actual crime by the president. ""Like war, impeachment is hell,"" Starr told the 100 senators who will decide Trump's fate. ""At least presidential impeachment is hell."" He also said in the Nixon and Clinton cases there was a bipartisan consensus between Democrats and Republicans in the House to impeach the president. ""Not a single House member of the president's party supported either of the two articles of impeachment,"" Starr said. ""Not one."" ""Impeachment must be bipartisan in nature,"" he argued. Executive privilege Starr also reprised the argument made by White House lawyers on Saturday, January 25 that American voters – not Congress – should decide in November whether Trump should be removed from office. Starr's appearance drew a caustic comment from former Democratic senator Claire McCaskill, among others. ""I'm scratching my head here,"" McCaskill said. ""They get the lawyer who thought an extramarital affair was impeachable to argue that withholding urgent military assistance to an ally in war against our enemy for a political favor is not impeachable. ""If it wasn't so infuriating it would be hysterical,"" she said. If the Senate does subpoena Bolton, the White House is likely to cite executive privilege to try to send the matter to the courts and prevent him from testifying. House investigators asked Bolton to testify but declined to force him to do so with a subpoena out of fear it would be tied up in the courts. Bolton, who was fired by Trump in September after 17 months in the job, has since said he was prepared to testify before the Senate. – Rappler.com "

The National Transportation Safety Board and other authorities survey the wreckage of the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California. Photo by David Swanson/EPA-EFE LOS ANGELES, USA – Federal investigators on Monday, January 27 sifted through the wreckage of the helicopter crash that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and 8 other people, hoping to find clues to what caused the accident that stunned the world. Bryant, 41, was traveling Sunday with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and 7 other passengers and crew when the Sikorsky S-76 slammed into a rugged hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of LA. There were no survivors. A five-time NBA champion for his only team, the LA Lakers, and a double Olympic gold medalist, Bryant is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in history. He was traveling on his private helicopter from Orange County, where he lived, to his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks where his daughter was set to play. Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a press conference that investigators would remain at the site of the crash throughout the week to collect evidence. ""It was a pretty devastating accident scene,"" she said, adding that the wreckage was strewn across about 600 feet (180 meters). ""We will be here about 5 days on scene to collect perishable evidence,"" she said. ""We are not here to determine the cause of the accident. We will not determine that on scene."" Homendy said the aircraft did not have a black box, which was not required on that type of helicopter. Spatial disorientation Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters that it would ""take a while"" to recover the remains of the victims because of the force of the crash and the rugged terrain. He added that given the number of people trying to access the site unlawfully, his agency has had to resort to police on horseback or all terrain vehicles to secure the area. ""We want to make sure everyone stays where they should be ... and keep everyone safe because the area is dangerous even in daytime because of the steepness of the terrain,"" he said. Philippe Lesourd, a helicopter pilot and instructor who has been flying in California for 29 years, told AFP that the heavy fog likely caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. He said he pilot most probably suffered ""spatial disorientation"" after losing sight of the ground upon entering the clouds. The fog was heavy enough on Sunday that the Los Angeles Police Department and the sheriff's office grounded their helicopters for part of the day. Witnesses told local media the helicopter appeared to be flying very low and seemed to struggle before it slammed into a hillside. Dozens of firefighters and paramedics battled across hilly terrain to reach the flaming wreckage but found no survivors. 'LA feels empty' Villanueva said the recovery effort would probably take days because the steep terrain at the crash site made it a ""logistical nightmare."" Apart from Bryant and his daughter Gianna, the other passengers on the flight included baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife Keri and their daughter Alyssa, who played basketball at the same club as Gianna. Christina Mauser, an assistant coach of the Mamba girls' basketball team, was also killed along with Sarah and Payton Chester, a mother and daughter. News of the crash reverberated across the globe and hundreds gathered at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, where Bryant wowed fans for 20 years, placing flowers, candles and messages for their fallen hero. ""It's unbelievable that he is gone,"" said Esmeralda Cisneros. ""Everyone feels empty. California and LA feel empty without him. Tributes have also flooded in from former US presidents, pop stars and athletes from different sports, a sign of how the man known as the ""Black Mamba"" had transcended basketball. ""Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,"" Barack Obama tweeted. The NBA announced that it had postponed Tuesday's Lakers game against the Los Angeles Clipper in the wake of the tragedy. ""The decision was made out of respect for the Lakers organization, which is deeply grieving the tragic loss of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people in a helicopter crash on Sunday,"" a statement said. Bryant's career began in 1996, straight out of high school. On top of his NBA championship wins, he helped the US squad of all-stars to Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London. Fairytale farewell Bryant bowed out of the NBA in 2016, scoring 60 points in a fairytale farewell appearance at the Staples Center. The son of former NBA player Joe ""Jellybean"" Bryant, the Lakers legend was born in Philadelphia while his father played for the 76ers. The elder Bryant played from 1984 to 1991 in Italy, giving young Kobe a global worldview as he grew up dreaming of following his dad into the NBA. He would eventually join the ranks of professionals at the age of 17, jumping directly into the NBA, only the sixth player to make such a leap. At 18, Bryant became, at the time, the youngest player or starter in an NBA game and the youngest winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. With Bryant alongside Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers captured 3 straight NBA crowns from 2000-2002, returning the team to glory days unseen since 1988. Bryant's career was almost derailed in 2003 when he was arrested in Colorado over a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee where Bryant was staying ahead of knee surgery. He admitted to adultery but denied an accusation of rape and the case was dropped in 2004 after the accuser refused to testify. A separate civil suit was settled under terms kept private. After his playing career, Bryant branched out into the entertainment industry. In 2018, he won an Oscar for his animated short film ""Dear Basketball,"" a love letter to the sport which brought him fame and fortune. The film was made available for free on Monday on Vimeo and the dearbasketball.com website. – Rappler.com  "

Photo by Tolga Akmen/AFP BRUSSELS, Belgium – At midnight on Friday, January 24 –1,317 days after British voters decided to leave the European Union – Brexit will finally come about. What will change on February 1? At first, not much. Daily business between the United Kingdom and the EU will continue as before during an 11-month transition period until the end of the year. This will allow London and Brussels to negotiate new arrangements to guide future relations, but in the meantime there are some practical changes. No turning back In theory, the British government could rescind its decision to leave the European Union at any moment until midnight on Friday (2300 GMT), as if nothing had happened. But from then on there will be no turning back, the union would have lost one of its largest and richest states, the first ever to quit the project. The EU will therefore lose 66 million inhabitants – leaving it with a population of around 446 million – along with 5.5% of its land mass. If Britain ever does decide it wants back in, then this will be a matter for EU accession procedures as for any outside applicant. The institutions In Brussels, the lowering of the Union Jack outside the European Parliament will symbolize a concrete change: Britain is out of the union and a ""third country."" It will have no MEPs. 73 Brits elected in May will leave. 46 of the seats will be kept for future EU members and 27 will be distributed among under-represented countries. Britain will no longer have a right to nominate a top official to the European Commission, although London failed to do so last year and its seat is already vacant. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will no longer be invited to summits of the European Council of leaders, and ministers will no longer attend EU council meetings. As non-EU citizens, Brits will not be eligible for senior bureaucratic posts in Brussels, but many have already secured dual nationality and residence rights. Britain will, however, continue to pay into the EU budget as the second largest net contributor after Germany until the end of the transition. Citizens rights According to the United Nations, around 1.2 million British citizens live in other EU countries, mainly in Spain, Ireland, France, Germany, and Italy. And according to the UK stats office, another 2.9 million citizens of other EU countries live in Britain, around 4.6% of the population. Under the withdrawal agreement signed by both sides, both sets of expatriates will initially retain the rights they had before Brexit to work and reside in their host country. But Britons in Europe and EU citizens in the UK may have to register with the authorities and individual member states will set up procedures of their own. Free movement will apply until the end of the transition. Afterwards, the withdrawal treaty says EU nationals will be able to stay in the UK if they continue to work. The UK government has said it intends to end ""freedom of movement"" for future EU arrivals, and precise details of reciprocal rights will be negotiated after Brexit. The negotiations Britain has, of course, already spent years negotiating with European Commission official Michel Barnier's Brexit task force on the terms of its departure. But these negotiations will change after Friday, when the ""Article 50"" procedure in the European Treaty expires and the UK becomes a third country. The UK will nevertheless remain subject to EU law and the European Court of Justice until the end of the transition, and in any judgements in cases pending from before the final departure. Barnier is in talks with EU member states to draw up a negotiating mandate for a trade agreement to govern cross-Channel commercial ties after the transition. This will then be hammered out with UK officials in the same way as Europe's free trade agreements with other third countries, such as Canada or Singapore. Unlike the withdrawal deal between the UK and Commission, ratified by EU members, the trade deal must be passed by more than 30 national and regional parliaments. – Rappler.com "

The UN mission in Libya, UNSMIL, condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the rocket strikes on Tripoli's Mitiga airport, which has been hit by repeated attacks in recent months. UNSMIL said in a statement Sunday evening that the strikes had wounded at least two civilians as well as damaged the tarmac and a number of buildings at the airport. (READ: Libya war leaves thousands homeless in Tripoli) World leaders met in Berlin last weekend and committed to ending all foreign meddling in Libya and to upholding the 2011 UN Security Council weapons embargo as part of a broader plan to end the country's conflict. They also agreed to a permanent ceasefire and steps to dismantle numerous militias and armed groups, while pushing a political process under the UN. But fighting broke out on Sunday in the Abu Grein region, 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Sirte, according to sources on both sides of the conflict. Libya has been mired in chaos since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that killed longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, with two rival administrations latterly vying for power. The conflict deepened last year when military strongman Khalifa Haftar, who controls much of the south and east of Libya, launched an assault in April to seize Tripoli, base of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA). 'Blatant violations' On Saturday, January 25, the UN had said it ""deeply regrets the continued blatant violations of the arms embargo in Libya."" ""Over the last 10 days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country, providing the parties with advanced weapons, armoured vehicles, advisers, and fighters,"" it added. UNSMIL said the ceasefire, which had provided much-needed respite for civilians in Tripoli, was now at risk of collapse. ""This fragile truce is now threatened by the ongoing transfer of foreign fighters, weapons, ammunition and advanced systems to the parties by member states, including several who participated in the Berlin conference,"" it said. On Sunday, Germany's foreign ministry backed the UNSMIL statement and voiced concerns about ""a series of unconfirmed but credible reports of embargo violations on both sides"". Haftar has the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia while the GNA is supported by Qatar and Turkey. On Sunday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan travelled to Algiers for talks with his Algerian counterpart on Libya's crisis and the January 12 ceasefire, which Moscow and Ankara brokered. Algeria shares a common border with Libya of some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles). Ahead of his departure, Erdogan lashed out afresh at Haftar, calling him a ""putschist"" and claiming he was ""constantly behind violations of the ceasefire."" The UN says the fighting since last April has killed more than 280 civilians and over 2,000 combatants, while thousands have been wounded on both sides. More than 170,000 Tripoli residents have been displaced. Renewed clashes around Tripoli on Saturday, January 25 killed at least one civilian – a Moroccan national – and wounded 7 others, GNA health ministry spokesperson Amin al-Hashemi told AFP. 'Stable ceasefire' The UN is hoping to hold inter-Libyan talks soon in Geneva to consolidate the sagging truce, as its mission in the country warns of ""a renewed and intensified round of fighting."" A military commission established at the Berlin summit – comprising 5 GNA loyalists and 5 Haftar delegates – has been tasked with defining ways of making the truce hold. ""What's important now is to achieve a stable ceasefire, which the military committee '5 + 5'... wants to negotiate in the coming days,"" the German foreign ministry said. Ankara dispatched troops – in a training capacity, it said – to support the GNA earlier this month in a move criticized by European powers and US President Donald Trump. Western powers are keen to stabilise Libya – home to Africa's largest proven crude reserves – because of concerns Islamist militants and migrant smugglers, already active, will take advantage of the chaos. Libya's National Oil Corporation said Saturday that oil production had plunged by around three-quarters since pro-Haftar forces launched a blockade the day before the Berlin summit, causing estimated losses of over $250 million. – Rappler.com "

Photo by said Khatib AFP WASHINGTON, DC, USA – President Donald Trump on Tuesday, January 28 will ignore accusations – led by the Palestinians themselves – of pro-Israeli bias and unveil what he says is a peace plan capable of solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Long held secret, the plan will finally be aired jointly by Trump and visiting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House. Given that it has been rejected by the Palestinians, the latest of many US proposals to address the bitter, multi-generational Mideast conflict might seem to have little future. But Trump insists he is optimistic and whatever happens, both he and Netanyahu could reap political benefits as they battle respective domestic scandals. ""It might have a chance,"" Trump said of the plan at an initial Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu on Monday, January 27. Trump, whose impeachment trial in the Senate is entering a critical phase, said his plan was getting widespread support from ""many of the Arab nations"" and claimed that even Palestinians would come round to the idea. ""It's very good for them, in fact it's overly good for them,"" Trump told reporters. ""We think we will have ultimately the support of the Palestinians."" Netanyahu, praising Trump as ""the greatest friend that Israel's had in the White House,"" described the peace plan as ""the deal of the century."" Netanyahu faces corruption charges, as well as a tense election in just over a month where his right-wing Likud is neck-and-neck with Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White party. On Monday, January 27, Trump also met separately with Gantz, but the limelight fell almost entirely on the incumbent prime minister – as will any political dividends from a peace plan favoring Israel. No deal No Palestinians have been invited to the White House event. They say they were never included in crafting the plan, which was overseen by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Shtayyeh on Monday urged international powers to boycott the plan, which he said was designed ""to protect Trump from impeachment and protect Netanyahu from prison."" ""It is not a Middle East peace plan,"" Shtayyeh told a cabinet meeting. ""This plan gives Israel sovereignty over Palestinian territory."" The plan, whose details still remained under wraps up to the last minute, has been gestating for so long that skeptics asked whether it really existed. Aaron David Miller, a Mideast expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Kushner's team wants to ""finally, basically demonstrate that they have a plan"" – and to do so ahead of the US presidential election in November. Trump has already thrown Netanyahu a string of political presents throughout his first term. These include breaking with international diplomatic consensus to recognize the disputed city of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which were seized from neighboring Syria, and ending opposition to Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land. Last Thursday, January 23, Trump described the still-unpublished peace plan as ""great"" and said it ""really would work."" But on Sunday, January 26, Palestinian leaders warned that instead of bringing peace, the plan could trigger their withdrawal from key provisions of the decades-old Oslo Accords, which sought to map out peaceful Israeli-Palestinian relations. ""Trump's plan is the plot of the century to liquidate the Palestinian cause,"" the Palestinian foreign ministry said in a statement. – Rappler.com "

A view of the volcano from Balete, Batangas, on January 26, 2020. Photo by Charles Salazar/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Taal Volcano's sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission and number of volcanic earthquakes went down further in the past 24 hours, said state volcanologists on Tuesday morning, January 28. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in its 8 am bulletin on Tuesday that the SO2 emission was ""below instrumental detection,"" or too low to be detected. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. More SO2 is released when magma is near the surface of a volcano. The previous average given on Monday, January 27, was 87 tons per day. At high points in Taal's activity in the past two weeks, SO2 emission averaged thousands of tons per day. Meanwhile, there continues to be fewer volcanic earthquakes. Quakes are another indicator that magma is moving or rising toward the surface. The Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 755 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12, when the Taal unrest began. Of these, 176 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. But from 5 am on Monday until 5 am on Tuesday, there were only 3 volcanic earthquakes plotted. These were magnitudes 1.5 to 2.2, with no felt event. The Taal Volcano Network, which can record small earthquakes undetectable by the Philippine Seismic Network, recorded 92 volcanic earthquakes in the past 24 hours. These included 4 low-frequency events, which are ""caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface,"" according to the United States Geological Survey. Phivolcs had said on Monday that the Taal Volcano Network recorded 170 volcanic earthquakes, including 4 which were low-frequency. As for activity at the main crater, Phivolcs said on Tuesday morning that it observed ""weak to voluminous emission of white to dirty white steam-laden plumes 100 to 800 meters"" in the past 24 hours. Despite the easing situation, Phivolcs reiterated that Alert Level 3 remains raised for Taal Volcano, since the unrest has not completely stopped. The following could still happen, which would threaten Taal Volcano Island and lakeshore areas in the province of Batangas: Taal Volcano Island; the barangays of Bilibinwang, Subic Ilaya, and Banyaga in Agoncillo; and the barangays of Gulod, Buso-Buso, and Bugaan East in Laurel remain on lockdown. These areas are within a 7-kilometer radius from the main crater, which is Phivolcs' recommended danger zone while Taal is under Alert Level 3. The volcano had been downgraded from Alert Level 4 to Alert Level 3 or a ""decreased tendency towards hazardous eruption"" last Sunday, January 26. Alert Level 4, which meant a hazardous eruption might occur within hours to days, was raised on January 12, forcing tens of thousands of families to flee.

Workers are seen at the construction site of a new hospital being built to treat patients from a deadly virus outbreak in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province on January 27, 2020. Photo by Hector Retamal/AFP WUHAN, China – Hundreds of workers are toiling around the clock at the site of a field hospital that China is racing to build within days to treat a rapidly growing number of patients stricken by a deadly virus. The outline of a floor began to take shape and electrical switchboards were already up on Monday, January 27 when AFP reporters visited the site of the facility, dubbed ""Fire God Mountain,"" being built in Wuhan, the central city where the coronavirus first emerged. It is one of two makeshift hospitals that Chinese authorities are rushing to build within a fortnight in the city of 11 million people to relieve medical facilities swamped with patients waiting for hours to see doctors. Work to build Fire God Mountain started Friday and is due to be ready to receive patients on February 3, according to state media. The second one, named ""Thunder God Mountain,"" will be ready for use on February 5. The construction workers all wore masks as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of the city, which has been under lockdown since Thursday, January 23. They are checked for fevers when they arrived by bus and again during their breaks. They worked around a forest of excavators and trucks bringing in prefab material at the site on the southwestern side of the city. ""We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,"" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP. He said he worked 9 hours per day, ""sometimes less, sometimes more. It depends on what they need"". All workers mobilized The 25,000-square-metre hospital will have between 700 and 1,000 beds to treat patients of a pneumonia-like virus that has killed 81 people – mostly in Wuhan – and infected more than 2,700 across the country. The second facility will have 1,300 beds. ""We've mobilized all the workers left in Wuhan to work in shifts to ensure round-the-clock construction,"" Zhang Chongxi, general manager of the road and bridge company of Wuhan Construction, was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency. Chen Bingzhong, a former health ministry official, said the facilities are needed because infectious diseases should not be treated in general hospitals. ""Because the infectious power of this virus is too strong, it will infect other patients, including medical staff,"" Chen told AFP. 'Let's go Wuhan' China has experience building hospitals in record time in periods of crisis. In 2003, it built a facility in Beijing within a week to treat patients during the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic. Authorities have used this as a model for the new facilities for the patients ill with the novel virus, which shares genetic similarities with SARS. Premier Li Keqiang visited one of the construction sites on Monday during his first trip to Wuhan since the health crisis erupted – a sign of the growing concern among the leadership in Beijing. ""Fast doesn't mean without quality,"" Li, who wore a mask, told the workers, according to videos of his visit. ""Fire God Mountain"" is being erected next to a residential building. A road outside the construction site is used to park dozens of trucks and construction vehicles. The city's new rallying cry – ""Let's go Wuhan!"" – was written on a banner across the front of a truck. Bulldozers flattened the earth, electricians installed 5G antennas, and workers began to bury pipes. ""We are happy to help in this situation.

The House committee on constitutional amendments chaired by Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez recommend changes to the proposed amendment to form a Regional Development Authority due to possible conflict. Rappler screenshot MANILA, Philippines – Upon the reopening of hearings on charter change, the House committee on constitutional amendments saw kinks and suggested remedies in the proposals submitted by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Federalism and Constitutional Reform. In particular, the House panel was concerned on the issue of empowerment of the Regional Development Authority (RDA). The hearing was held after the committee recalled its previous resolution amending parts of the 1987 Constitution, which included easing the constraints on foreign investments in the Philippines. That resolution was discreetly approved in December 2019. Also part of that recalled resolution was mandating that the president and vice president be voted as a team, extending the term of House members and local government unit officials from 3 years to 5 years, and cutting senators' terms from 6 years to 5 years. The IATF, however, submitted a broader set of proposed amendments to the constitution to the House committee chaired by Cagayan de Oro City 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez. On Tuesday, January 28, the House panel discussed the IATF's proposed amendments, including the transformation of the Regional Development Council (RDC) to the RDA, enabling the body to acquire funding and approve and implement regional projects. The task force argued that the current RDCs were powerless because of the lack of funds. It proposed that RDAs would have a just share in all national taxes as determined by law, based on financial needs, organizational capacities, and resources. The proposal also said that the RDA head would be appointed by the president. However, lawmakers said there were two possible conflicts in the proposed creation of the RDA. These are in terms of project implementation and among the members of the new unit. Surigao del Sur 2nd District Representative Johnny Pimentel said, if the RDA would have the power to formulate, implement, and monitor development plans, this would conflict with the powers of other government units such as the Department of Public Works and Highways in the case of infrastructure projects. Pimentel added, that the appointment of the RDA head by the president could cause internal conflict because of political rivalries. Isabela 1st District Representative Antonio ""Tonypet"" Albano said a presidential appointment would not be in the spirit of decentralization.""We are not actually decentralizing when the president appoints the [RDA head], which may have conflicts with the provincial and regional governor,"" Albano said. The House panel recommended two options. First, the local government officials could field 2-3 candidates that the President can choose from, so that the region would still have a hand on choosing the RDA head. Second, local government officials may elect the RDA head among themselves. ""They are in a better position to know who would be their leader,"" Pimentel said. The recommendations would be forwarded to the task force and would be discussed in future hearings. Interior Secretary Eduardo Año requested to brief all lawmakers on the proposed amendments, tentatively scheduled on February 4.

The contagion, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Lunar New Year holiday unfolds. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) ""It's deeply stressful,"" Joseph Pacey, a 31-year-old Briton who teaches English in Wuhan, told AFP. ""The virus is scary, but the biggest fear for me is that this thing will go on for months, and it will get harder and harder to get supplies, and to live."" Governments are scrambling to devise ways to safely get their citizens out of the city of 11 million. Japan announced it would send a chartered flight to Wuhan on Tuesday evening to evacuate about 200 of 650 Japanese nationals. ""We will also bring with it aid supplies such as masks and protective suits for Chinese people as well as for Japanese nationals,"" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in Tokyo. Motegi said the plane would leave Wuhan on Wednesday morning, and that efforts were being made ot organize more flights. Flight delays The United States was also trying to organise a rescue mission. A chartered California-bound flight with limited space had been scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens. But the State Department said it was postponed to Wednesday, without giving a reason. France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week. Several other countries also were working to repatriate their people, while Germany said it was considering doing so. Exposure to a sneeze or cough from an infected person appeared to be the main transmission mode, Chinese infectious disease experts told reporters on Tuesday. To prevent huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country. In the latest move, state-owned China Railway Group announced on Tuesday that it would suspend hundreds of train lines throughout the country. China already has extended the Lunar New Year national holiday into next week to keep people at home. And the education ministry on Tuesday said the spring semester for schools and universities would be postponed, giving no resumption date. Death toll climbs Despite the unprecedented measures, the virus has showed little sign of slowing down. The National Health Commission on Tuesday announced 26 new deaths, bringing the nationwide total to 106. Confirmed infections also nearly doubled compared to Monday, to 4,515. Nearly 7,000 more cases are suspected and awaiting confirmation. On Monday, the first infections were confirmed in Germany, Canada and Sri Lanka. Colombo followed up by imposing new visa restrictions on Chinese visitors to the island. President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing ""any help that is necessary"" in combatting the virus. But the United States, Turkey and Germany were among nations urging their citizens to ""reconsider"" all travel to China. Landlocked Mongolia – which is heavily dependent on trade with China – took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbor to cars, while banning large gatherings and suspending classes. Fighting spirit Medical facilities have been overwhelmed in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost town. China has deployed hundreds of military medics to help and is building two field hospitals, aiming to finish them in just 10 days. Hundreds of masked workers toiled around the clock at one site, where a foundation was already taking shape and electrical switchboards were up. ""We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,"" a worker in his 30s, told AFP. Pacey, the British teacher, said he and other foreign friends in Wuhan were in contact via chat groups ""to keep each other's spirits up."" He was rationing what food he had and hopes for a UK-organised evacuation, but complained that his government has been unresponsive. ""Things here are going to get worse, and I feel that China should be able to deal with their own citizens and not have me needing extra help,"" he said. But Wuhan's people, who have a reputation in China for resilience, sought to project a fighting spirit. Quarantined residents shouted ""Go Wuhan"" from towering apartment blocks, according to videos posted online. A building lit up the night sky late on Monday with those words in red. The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. But the WHO on Monday admitted making an error in originally assessing the virus' worldwide threat as ""moderate"", issuing an update late Sunday saying the risk was actually ""high at the global level.""

Japanese Chef Kei Kobayashi (center) has been awarded 3 stars by the Michelin guide international. Photo by Martin Bureau/AFP PARIS, France – Chef Kei Kobayashi became the first Japanese chef ever to win the maximum 3 Michelin stars in France on Monday, January 27. The flamboyant 42-year-old, who was born in Nagano, was the biggest winner on a night when Japanese cooks triumphed in the backyard of French haute cuisine. Kazuyuki Tanaka won two stars for Racine, his restaurant in the northeastern city of Reims, as did Yasunari Okazaki for his sushi and crossover cuisine at L'Abysee au Pavillon Ledoyen in Paris. Kobayashi – a striking figure with bleached blond hair – said Japanese cooks have earned their place at the top table of French cuisine. ""There are lots of Japanese chefs now in France and you have accepted us and given us a place,"" he said as picked up the highest distinction in French cooking. ""Thank you, France,"" he added. Kobayashi admitted that his perfectionism can make him a ""difficult person"" to work with. ""I am quite hard. I ask a lot of my team, and then I ask a lot more,"" he joked. A dozen top Japanese cooks in France have shaken up the elite ranks of the Michelin in recent years, led by two-star chefs Takao Takano in Lyon and Masafumi Hamano at the Au 14 Fevrier near Macon in rural Burgundy. Last year, Keigo Kimura at the Asperule in Dijon and Takafumi Kikuchi at La Sommeliere in Lyon won their first stars for helping to re-define and re-invent French cuisine. Kobayashi opened his restaurant, Kei, in centre of the French capital 9 years ago, and wowed diners with such dishes as sea bass cooked on its scales and smoked salmon with roquette mousse and a tomato vinaigrette with lemon emulsion. 'Virtuoso of flavors' Critics hailed the precision of his cooking and the way he made relatively simple dishes like gnocchi, truffle, bellota ham, and parmesan cheese extraordinary. He told AFP after his Michelin victory Monday that he didn't like his cooking ""categorized"" as either French or Japanese, ""just the best"". The famous red guide described him as a ""virtuoso of flavors"" and his cooking as both ""delicate and memorable"". ""It's very simple. Every dish that Kei turns the rigor of his attention to is called on to become a signature one,"" it added. But not all French gastronomes were quite as convinced of his genius. The influential culinary website Atabula said his cooking lacked ""coherence and emotion"", adding that although his restaurant was ""a good two-star table, it's a thin three-star one"". Kobayashi, however, is not one to be easily shaken. With its sparse grey interior, the chef said he did not need to hang pictures on the walls of his 30-seat restaurant, which he runs with his wife Chikako. ""My cuisine provides the necessary touches of color,"" he declared. New French openness The son of a chef who worked in a traditional Japanese multi-course ""kaiseki"" restaurant, Kobayashi decided to dedicate himself to French cuisine after watching a television documentary about the nouvelle cuisine pioneer Alain Chapel, himself a three-star Michelin chef. He moved to France in 1998 after training in French restaurants in Japan, working under the legendary chef Gilles Goujon at the Auberge du Vieux Puits on the Swiss border and Alain Ducasse at the Plaza Athenee in Paris before going out on his own. Michelin's rewarding of so many Japanese chefs again shows how French gastronomy – once regarded as the best in the world – has opened up to foreign cooks as its dominance has waned. Last year, the Argentinian Mauro Colagreco became the first foreign chef working in France to get 3 Michelin stars for his restaurant Mirazur, overlooking the Mediterranean at Menton near the Italian border. Two French chefs – Christopher Coutanceau from the western port city of La Rochelle and Glenn Viel, who cooks at the Oustau de Baumaniere hotel in Baux-de-Provence – joined Kobayashi this year in earning the maximum Michelin ranking. Only some 130 restaurant worldwide hold the prestigious guide's highest distinction. – Rappler.com "

While the issue of her management is still under contention with Viva threatening legal action against Nadine or others that do business with her directly, one thing's for sure: Nadine is taking her life into her own hands – and part of that is going back to what she says is her first love: music. In December 2019, Nadine signed as a talent under James' music label Careless, and said that this year, she plans to take her music career to the next level.  SIGNED ARTIST. Nadine poses with the team at her label, Careless after signing a contract with them.

""This year, I wanna explore more on that side, I wanna go back to where I started,"" she said. Nadine shared that she's working on an album – but can't share when she's going to release it just yet. ""I'll just drop it when I feel like it,"" she laughed. We may not know when this new album is coming, but Nadine clued us into the kind of stuff we can expect. It'll definitely be pop – perhaps to honor the ""pop girl"" in her – but this time, she'll veer away from bubblegum bops, and lean more into grown-up territory: pop with smatterings of house, R&B, and EDM.

The 5 songs that changed Nadine's life give us even more insight into her musical side.

""Digital Love"" by Daft Punk ""I just grew up with that song. I have good memories with that song, memories with my dad also because he loves Daft Punk. I think that's where I got my love for music, from my dad, because he would listen to music everyday.

Morente cited the move of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to suspend direct flights from Wuhan City, the epicenter of the virus. Philippine health authorities had not yet confirmed a case of novel coronavirus in the country but as of Tuesday, 3 people were being monitored for flu-like symptoms at the San Lazaro hospital in Manila. Two of the 3 patients have a history of travel to Wuhan. Morente clarified there is no policy to bar Chinese nationals in general, so those who have other valid visas can still enter the Philippines. “We have not received any directive imposing policy changes on Chinese nationals. But we are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCov,” Morente said.

Photo by Mara Cepeda/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Two congressmen who belong to political dynasties opposed the proposal to include in the Constitution the prohibition on relatives within the second degree of consanguinity to run in the same elections. As the House committee on constitutional amendments reopened its hearings on charter change on Tuesday, January 28, Isabela 1st District Representative Antonio “Tonypet” Albano said it is “anti-democratic” to include anti-dynasty provisions in the Constitution. “This is very anti-democratic because there are families elected democratically,” said Albano, whose older brother Rodolfo “Rodito” Albano III is currently governor of Isabela. Their father, the late Rodolfo “Rudy” Albano Jr, was also serving as LPG Marketers Association Inc in the 18th Congress when he died in November 2019. “The strengthening of political reforms and educating people is more important than limiting the democratic right of a person to run and be voted upon, whether he is a spouse, a son, a brother, or a sister,” added the younger Albano. (READ: [OPINION] Political dynasties: Impossibility of democracy) The House panel was discussing the list of proposed amendments by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Federalism and Constitutional Reform, composed of 11 member-agencies under President Rodrigo Duterte’s government. One proposed amendment is to bar spouses or relatives within the second civil degree of consanguinity of an incumbent official to run for the same position in the succeeding elections. Persons that fall under the same relations would also not be allowed to simultaneously hold positions for governor and vice governor as well as mayor and vice mayor. Albano was against this, arguing that the proposed prohibition “curtails” the right of the people to vote. “Kung magkagalit ’yong magkapatid, mag-ama (If the siblings or the father and son are not in good terms)...don’t we give that right to the people for them to decide which is the better brother or which is the better father or son? That again strikes [as] anti-democratic,” the Isabela representative said. His sentiments were echoed by Deputy Speaker and Surigao del Sur 2nd District Representative Johnny Pimentel, whose brother Alexander Pimentel is currently provincial governor. “We are curtailing already the right of the ordinary citizen to vote! Kung maganda naman ’yong trabaho no’ng incumbent…it’s the right of the people to vote, to put in place who would be their congressman, their governor,” the Surigao del Sur congressman said. He suggested that the House committee on constitutional amendments defer finalizing the anti-political dynasty provision as it is “a very contentious and very controversial issue.” At least 163 political families currently have members who won as senators, House representatives, and governors during the 2019 elections. (READ: MAP: Major political families in PH after the 2019 elections) The President himself is part of a political dynasty, as 3 of his children won seats in Davao City during the 2019 elections: Mayor Sara Duterte, Vice Mayor Sebastian Duterte, and Davao City 1st District Representative Paolo Duterte. Article II, Section 26 of the Constitution prohibits political dynasties, but there is supposedly no law to implement this provision. However, Rappler columnist Emil Marañon III, an election lawyer, argues that Republic Act No. 10742 or the Sangguniang Kabataan Reform Act already defines what a political dynasty is, and can be the basis for implementing the constitutional ban. (READ ALSO: [OPINION] Practical questions on the Sangguniang Kabataan law's anti-dynasty provision) There have been repeated attempts in Congress to finally pass the anti-political dynasty bill over the years, but the measure has so far failed to hurdle the Senate and the House, where scions of political clans are repeatedly elected into office. Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, Agusan del Norte 1st District Representative Lawrence Fortun, and 1-Sagip Representative Rodante Marcoleta have filed their own versions of the anti-dynasty bill, but the measures are pending with committees. Several experts and political scientists have suggested that Congress just prohibit “fat dynasties” or families with two or more members in power all at the same time and allowing those who serve in succession. – Rappler.com "

665,250389,"January 29, 2020",IMHO,[OPINION] I won’t wear KNPP clothing’s lewd shirts,Jose P. Mojica,"'If clothes reflect who we are, then what does it mean when we wear a shirt with a vulva?'    Clothes are more than just a cover for our bodies. They are revelations, for they speak even before the wearer speaks, or without the wearer having to speak. They are extensions of man. The clothes and the wearer are not separate. They project the aspired identity or our real identity. “They change our view of the world and the world’s view of us,” writes Virginia Woolf. A change of clothes is a change of identity. The repetition of clothes is also the repetition of identity. Never would it not say anything about anyone. Just recently, social media exploded with call-outs against KNPP Clothing, a brand that sells what many find offensive or lewd shirt designs. To begin with, KNPP means kain pepe. In the vernacular, kain means eat and pepe means vagina. Many of their shirt designs feature graphic variations of the vulva – a puzzle vulva, a vulva on a heart, a vulva on pizza, a vulva on ice cream. There are also designs showing various personalities sticking out their tongues and making the V sign, a gesture signifying cunnilingus. Urban dictionary calls this the “vagface.” The vulgarity of these shirts disgusted many Filipinos across genders and ages. Of course, as Filipinos, we know what the shirts mean and don't need to have dirty minds to comprehend them. Kain pepe has no other meaning but cunnilingus. The owners of the clothing brand must be aware of how they would be understood. They have no excuse. These shirts exhibited the shameless sexualization and commodification of a woman’s private parts. This is indecent exposure. These shirts refer to the public display of one’s body, which may be offensive within the moral and behavioral standards of a particular place or society. Although the term ""indecent exposure"" refers to the literal exposure of body parts, these shirts may be still categorized under it because they bear images of a body part that should not be exposed to the public. (READ: The many faces of sexual harassment in PH) ""Decency"" is the behavioral standards of a local community based on religion, morality, culture, and tradition. What may be unacceptable for us may be acceptable for others. But historically, it was never acceptable in the Philippines to expose private parts. We are a Catholic country – we remain conservative, though we have become progressive when it comes to other things. (READ: [Dash of SAS] Mr. President, keep your foul mouth away from our vaginas) Can we ever find these shirts acceptable in the near future?

666,250390,"January 28, 2020",Philippines,Panelo to U.S.: State reason for Dela Rosa's canceled visa 'out of courtesy',Sofia Tomacruz,"Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo says the United States should give an explanation since there should be courtesy 'among allies'  'COURTESY.' Presidential Chief Legal Counsel and Spokesperson Salvador Panelo says the United States should disclose why it canceled Senator Ronald dela Rosa's visa. Malacañang file photo MANILA, Philippines – Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo on Tuesday, January 28, insisted the United States government should explain, ""out of courtesy,"" why it canceled the visa of Philippine Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa. Panelo said that's the least the US could do since the Duterte government provided a reason when it banned several American senators from entering the Philippines. These American senators had backed sanctions against Philippine officials involved in extrajudicial killings and the detention of Senator Leila de Lima. ""What I'm saying is, we stated why we were banning their senators from coming here as a matter of courtesy and among allies, courtesy also requires – as a matter of courtesy, [dapat] sinabi rin sa sa atin (they should have also told us [why they canceled Dela Rosa's visa]),"" Panelo told reporters in a press conference in Malacañang on Tuesday. What canceled visa? Dela Rosa, who was President Rodrigo Duterte's first Philippine National Police chief responsible for implementing his bloody anti-drug campaign, earlier confirmed that his US visa had been canceled. According to the senator, Washington officials informed him he could apply for another visa if he wished. The visa cancellation angered Duterte and prompted him to threaten to terminate the two countries' 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). Special treatment? Reporters pointed out the seeming double standard of the Palace in demanding that the US government explain why it canceled Dela Rosa's visa. For one, after former foreign secretary Albert del Rosario was denied entry to Hong Kong in June 2019, Panelo claimed the Philippine government could not question the authority or right of a country ""to stop or to investigate any guest or visitor who wanted to enter that particular country."" ""That's their exclusive domain,"" Panelo said at the time. Del Rosario has been critical of Duterte's foreign policy approach, particularly moves to downplay the Philippines' victory over China before an arbitral tribunal in 2016. In addition, when sanctions against Philippine officials involved in De Lima's detention were included in the US State Department's 2020 budget, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said it was the US' prerogative to deny entry to individuals as it wished. Despite these, Panelo denied Dela Rosa is getting special treatment. He again drew parallels to how the Philippine government ""explained"" why it was denying entry to American senators involved in seeking sanctions against Philippine officials. Panelo went on to say that Dela Rosa's visa was canceled prior to the approval of sanctions found in the US State Department's 2020 budget and the US Senate's approval of a resolution invoking Global Magnitsky Act sanctions. ""It happened prior to the approval of that amendment.... Nauna 'yung cancellation kay Bato bago nung Senado na-approve (The cancellation of Bato's visa happened before the US Senate's approval),"" he said. The cancellation of Dela Rosa's visa is seen as an effect of the Global Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on human rights violators. – Rappler.com "

Rafael Nadal says he is playing better as the Australian Open progresses. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Rafael Nadal is taking nothing for granted in his Australian Open semifinal against Dominic Thiem despite owning a 100 percent record at Grand Slams against the slick Austrian. At stake for both men is a last-four clash against either resurgent veteran Swiss Stan Wawrinka or German young gun Alexander Zverev. Nadal was stretched to 4 sets for the first time in the tournament against explosive Australian Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round. But the Spaniard warned he was getting better by the day as he looks to add to his 2009 Melbourne Park title and draw level with Roger Federer on 20 Grand Slam crowns. ""I think I am moving in the right direction. Every day I'm playing a little bit better,"" said Nadal, who is aiming for a seventh Australian Open semifinals, while Thiem is gunning for his first. The two have met 13 times before and Nadal holds a 9-4 edge but 5-0 in Grand Slams, where he has claimed 3 of his last 4 victories over the Austrian. Thiem was the man he beat in the last two French Open finals and the top seed has a lot of time for how the 26-year-old goes about his business. ""Very tough match. He's playing well. I saw him play (fourth round) against Gael (Monfils). He was playing a very high level of tennis,"" said Nadal. ""We know each other well. He's a player that I like a lot, the way that he works, the way that he plays, and the way that he tries his best always."" ""It is a match that's going to be a tough one, but will be interesting. I know I have to be at my best to have chances."" Thiem took Nadal to 4 sets in the French Open final last year and pressed him to 5 sets in the 2018 US Open quarters, stunning the Spaniard by winning the opening set, 6-0. ""I couldn't be happier to be in the quarterfinals,"" he said, as he continues his search for a maiden Grand Slam title. ""I'm also very excited [to play Nadal]."" 'One of the toughest players' Like Thiem, Zverev is seen as one of the players capable of breaking the stranglehold of Nadal, Roger Federer, and Novak Djokovic at the major tournaments. But he must first get past Wawrinka, who is incredibly the only man other than the 3 greats to win the Melbourne Park title since 2006. Wawrinka upset the traditional order in 2014 when be beat Nadal and went on to win two more Grand Slams – the French Open in 2015 and US Open a year later – before knee surgery in 2017 halted his march. Now ranked 15, he said after upsetting 4th seed Daniil Medvedev to set up the Zverev clash that he was playing his best tennis since the surgery, with the passion to win another Slam still burning bright at 34. ""I've been feeling great on the court, on the practice court, putting a lot of work in physically and tennis-wise,"" said Wawrinka, who will have to overturn a 0-2 record against the 7th seed. ""Zverev, he's been in the top 10, top 5 since few years now. It's going to be a difficult match, for sure."" Zverev, who has huge potential but has yet to go beyond the quarterfinals in 18 Grand Slams, knows he has his work cut out against one of the toughest and most experienced competitors around. ""He showed why he's a Grand Slam champion, beating Medvedev, coming back from two-sets-to-one down, playing great tennis. He's still one of the toughest players to play, especially here in Australia,"" said the 22-year-old. – Rappler.com "

The 'World Dream' cruise ship arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 28, 2020. The Bureau of Quarantine declared its passengers free of the novel coronavirus. Photo from the Philippine Coast Guard MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Two ships from China docked at Pier 15 of the Port of Manila were declared ""clear and safe"" from the novel coronavirus by the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ), the Philippine Coast Guard said on Tuesday, January 28. The World Dream cruise ship arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on Tuesday. Its 778 passengers were ""authorized to travel"" by the BOQ. They were originally scheduled to board the ship again on Tuesday night to travel to Subic Bay for a tour on Wednesday, January 29. However, Olongapo City Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr and Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun both asked the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to stop admitting cruise ships because of the threat of the novel coronavirus. In Olongapo City, which faces Subic Bay, groups rallied to protest the arrival of cruise ships, worried it would put them at risk of exposure to the virus. Coast guard spokesperson Captain Armand Balilo said the World Dream's Subic tour has been canceled, and the cruise ship will sail back to Hong Kong on Wednesday. The other vessel, the cargo ship MV Ligulao, arrived in Manila from Lianyungang, Jiangsu, in mainland China on Monday, January 27. Although the BOQ declared the ship's 20 crew members free of the novel coronavirus, they were not allowed to disembark because they had no shore passes. The MV Ligulao is expected to leave Manila on Tuesday afternoon. Officials from the BOQ ran ""mandatory inspections"" of both vessels' crew and passengers, the coast guard said. When asked how the BOQ concluded that the people aboard the ship were free of the virus given that its carriers may not show any symptoms, the coast guard did not give an immediate answer. The coast guard works with the BOQ and the Bureau of Immigration (BI) in inspecting vessels coming into the Port of Manila. Immigration officers routinely board cruise ships bound for the Philippines at a foreign port, and then conduct inspections onboard while at sea, said Undersecretary Markk Perete of the Department of Justice (DOJ), which oversees the BI. ""We have directed the BI to coordinate with the Department of Health on the proper protocols – the use of masks and other protective clothing or gear, the procedure on face to face checks, et cetera. All these safety measures have been designed in coordination with, and taking into consideration, the inputs from our health officials,"" Perete said in a media interview on Tuesday. Although the DOJ temporarily suspended granting visas upon arrival to Chinese nationals starting Tuesday to ""slow down the influx of group tours,"" the order did not cover the passengers of the World Dream cruise ship because cruise passengers secure visas before arriving in the Philippines, BI Spokesperson Dana Mengote Sandoval told Rappler. The novel coronavirus is believed to have originated from Wuhan, China. At least 106 people have died in the epidemic that has spread throughout China, and reached several other countries around the world. Travel to and from Wuhan has been blocked, and travel in and around China has been restricted. Although the Philippines suspended flights to and from Wuhan, it has not extended the measure to cover China entirely. Philippine health officials are monitoring a number of patients with flu-like symptoms, including two at Manila's San Lazaro Hospital who have a history of travel to Wuhan.

I write this letter with urgent love – for my country and for you, too. This letter is for you – the white to my brown, the expat to my immigrant, the athleisure to my sando. Don’t worry, this is not about the 300 years in the convent or the 50 years in Hollywood, although let’s face it, we talk a lot about colonialism and imperialism without talking about whiteness. Relax, this is not about that. Our own colonial mentality and perverse piety are already taking care of the punishment and complicated guilt. (READ: Racism in the Philippines: Does it matter?) Let me first say that I am elitist. My attitude and behavior signal condescension. I don’t intentionally look down on others nor do I have any interest in doing so; I strive towards love. But I fully participate, despite my best intentions, in the self-delusion that I am rightly part of a select group. I cultivate the image of the Filipino-American ilustrado. I claim, with fervor, to have returned from the US “to do good, for good” – all in the built-in performance of social media. I operate on a set of assumptions that this beatific kindness entitles me to specific privileges. Yes, I am taking a risk in this very public space, but that is the market value my entitlement ordains me: I don’t have to care about what you think. I concede to this tension so that I might dismantle it. But I doubt that I could ever walk away completely because I am indebted to the cocooned upbringing of my brown skin. The OFW industrial complex – to which my nurse-mother was a necessary devotee – formed my deepest worldview about human dignity and capabilities. The balikbayan boxes were rehearsals to our American life. There, Los Angeles and New York trained me to be hypervigilant about identity and visibility, a skill coursing through the veins of my work now as an academic. Years of doubting and questioning my own sense of belonging shaped my desire to tackle the greatest needs among marginalized and disadvantaged groups. There is no way I am giving up these instincts. Yes, I strive towards love, yet I am elitist. And so I ask you, do you strive towards dismantling your own white resentment? Hear me out. There you are minding your own white self, maybe walking into a freezing shopping mall without a light sweater, and without having your bag checked by the security guard. Then, you feel Oriental eyes on the pursuit. And if you are a white man reading this, you were imagining the grins and side whispers from the young women with their necks craned in the shadows of your long strides. (READ: [DASH of SAS] Brown is the color of my skin and passport) And was there ever a time when Filipinos, total strangers, asked to take a photo with you? Or perhaps you’ve lost count of the number of times street children followed you, practiced their call-center English, and asked you for money. You can see where I’m going with this – because we all know how hawk-eyed you are to the reactions to your white skin. At first, you might have enjoyed it. The attention was tolerable, maybe strange or even cute, but over time, your celebrity status – of the tokenism kind – snowballed into annoyance and perhaps anger. You probably tried to ignore it, but this only magnified the problem because their seemingly trivial or benign fascination you experienced as hostile and insulting. (READ: Bianca Gonzalez on being morena: 'Hindi kami kawawa') I get you, I understand you. These are more than just hassles of everyday life. They can lead to stress that have detrimental consequences to mental and physical health. But here is where you lose me – when you jump to “reverse discrimination” or “white victimhood.” Your grievance assails preferential treatment. There are those of you who will say that you should not be treated differently from Filipinos because of your skin. You might go so far as to protest that your race, gender, and socioeconomic class should be de-emphasized not only because it is discriminatory but also because you are, at the end of it all, not spectacular. You might even defend Filipinos by suggesting that bias towards your white skin devalues others’ brown skin. If you are saying these things, then you’ve stopped listening, really listening. Your claims of reverse racism are precisely the projective disgust your white narcissism affords you. Again, hear me out. I ask you to concede to your color blindness so that you may dismantle it. When you claim that your white skin should not matter, it also means that you are not willing to acknowledge or admit that indeed our skin colors do matter – for you and me both. It is dismissive that Filipinos should avoid explicitly discussing skin color, as well as the convent and Hollywood that lay bare its complex meaning. You send the message that Filipinos should instead assimilate or acculturate to a warped worldview that is race-unconscious, the kind of distorted fear that underpins white victimhood against affirmative action. When you deny me and my brown brothers and sisters of our racial differences from your white skin – perhaps as a defensive move not to appear racist – you are also denying the gaping imbalance of power and privilege. Here in the Philippines, you are still the majority. My white brothers and sisters, I ask you not to deny the racial reality of both our skins. The young women at the mall and the children on the street are racially biased. But so are you.

Holidays extended Hundreds of millions of people criss-crossed the country last week return to their families for the Lunar New Year holiday, in what is typically a joyous time of gatherings and public celebration. Instead, public health officials asked China's 1.4 billion citizens to confine themselves at home until all is clear. Schools and universities across the country were ordered not to reopen until further notice on Tuesday, a day after the holiday break was extended to try and reduce the spread of the virus. Wuhan and Beijing had earlier cancelled public events that usually attract hundreds of thousands of people to temples during the New Year holiday. Attractions closed The historic Forbidden City – a sprawling imperial palace in Beijing and one of the country's most revered cultural sites – was closed from Saturday. Other famous landmarks including a section of the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs and Yinshan Pagoda are also not open to visitors. Tibet's Potala Palace was shut down on Monday. Disneyland theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have closed down indefinitely. Women's Olympics football qualifiers scheduled for next week in Wuhan have been moved out of the country and will now be held in Sydney. China's film box-office earnings for Lunar New Year's Eve on Friday were just one-tenth of last year as people shunned crowds. US coffee chain Starbucks said it had shut all its stores in Hubei during the holiday break. Travel screenings China has ordered sterilization and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains, while travellers are being screened for fever. Temperature screening checkpoints have been set up in hundreds of Chinese railway stations, according to state news agency Xinhua. Authorities have asked people to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, get plenty of fresh air and wear protective face masks. City authorities in Wuhan have gone further and made it mandatory to wear masks in public places. A similar order was issued in southern Guangdong province, which has more than 110 million people. With people rushing to get masks at pharmacies and on popular websites, China's industry and information technology ministry vowed to increase supply. Two new hospitals Authorities in Wuhan are rushing to build two field hospitals by next week to ease pressure on medical facilities in the city that are struggling to handle a growing caseload. The first facility is expected to be operational by next Monday and will have a capacity of 1,000 beds spread over 25,000 square metres, according to state media. The second is slated to open two days later with 1,300 beds. Xinhua said the two new hospitals in Wuhan would be similar in size to the temporary facility built to tackle SARS in Beijing in 2003, when 650 people died from the disease in the mainland and Hong Kong. – Rappler.com "

Kobe Bryant is remembered by his peers as a fierce competitor and a great inspiration to many. Photo by Larry W. Smith/EPA/EFE LOS ANGELES, USA – Kobe Bryant combined rare shooting skills, a tireless work ethic, fierce competitiveness, mental toughness, and creativity to become one of the NBA's greatest players, according to his fellow basketball legends. Bryant, who died on Sunday, January 26, aged 41 in a helicopter crash, was recalled as an iconic figure on and off the court who inspired younger players and delighted fans worldwide, embracing a global audience that adored him. ""He was a fierce competitor, one of the greats of the game and a creative force,"" said six-time NBA champion Michael Jordan. ""I loved Kobe – he was like a little brother to me."" On purely basketball terms, Bryant was simply among the elite guards in NBA history, a maestro with dazzling drives to the hoop and the courage to take high-pressure three-point shots and the skill to sink them. ""I have no fear whatsoever,"" Bryant said. ""If I take the last shot and miss, so what?"" It was a bravado that he backed up more often than not with spectacular plays, making teammates better and rivals dig deep for their very best. ""There will never be a greater warrior in our sport,"" said Mike Krzyzewski, who coached Bryant on 2008 and 2012 US Olympic gold medal teams. ""He was in constant pursuit of doing something special."" ""We have tragically lost one of the greatest sports figures of our time."" Bryant, an 18-time NBA All-Star in 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, won 5 titles in 7 NBA Finals trips. He was the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player, the 2009 NBA Finals and 2010 NBA MVP and a four-time NBA All-Star Game MVP. Bryant finished with 33,643 points, 7,047 rebounds, and 6,306 assists over 1,346 career NBA contests, making history from first game to last. As a rookie in 1996, Bryant was then the youngest-ever NBA player, days after his 18th birthday. At 37 in 2016, Bryant scored 60 points in his final NBA game, the oldest player to crack the milestone. ""Kobe was a chosen one, special in many ways to many people. He went beyond the veil,"" said Phil Jackson, who coached Jordan and Bryant to a combined 11 NBA titles. Outside the Boston Celtics' 1960s dynasty, the only guard to win more titles than Bryant was Jordan. Former Celtics center Bill Russell, an 11-time NBA champion, called Bryant ""one of the best basketball minds in the history of the game."" Jordan's former teammate Scottie Pippen was among Bryant's top admirers. ""Kobe wanted to be like Mike, and who didn't? He modeled his game after MJ's and aspired to be the best,"" Pippen said. ""But behind the scenes, Kobe was picking everybody's brains. I loved his approach... He cared so much about the game and winning and had an insatiable drive to constantly learn and improve... those are the things that will define his legacy."" 'Top two all-time' It was grit mixed with heart and genius that made the self-styled ""Mamba"" the envy of fellow superstars. ""One of the all-time greatest players,"" said Lakers guard LeBron James, a three-time NBA champion who overtook Bryant for No. 3 on the NBA career scoring list only hours before Bryant's death. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and James have scored more NBA points than Bryant, who began basketball at age 3 and adored the ""Showtime"" 1980s Lakers of Magic Johnson and Abdul-Jabbar. Johnson called Bryant ""the greatest Laker of all time"" while Abdul-Jabbar called him a ""magnificent athlete who inspired a whole generation."" For most current NBA talent, the greatest player when they grew up was Bryant. One of those was Zion Williamson, a 19-year-old who played his first NBA game just 4 days before Bryant's death. ""I think he's top two all-time,"" Williamson said of Bryant. Legendary achievements Stolen with Bryant's passing was his impact on the sport as an elder statesman as well as careers as a children's book writer and Oscar-winning filmmaker. ""Kobe was not only an icon in the sports arena, he was a man of the world and touched so many lives,"" said Celtics legend Larry Bird. Allen Iverson, whose lone NBA Finals visit was spoiled by Bryant's Lakers, said: ""A true student of the game... He prepared relentlessly. There is something we can all learn from the 'Mamba' mentality."" Bryant showed endurance as well, fighting off injuries throughout his career, notably going to the free throw line with a torn Achilles tendon in 2013. Only a handful of NBA players went beyond Bryant's 20 seasons, none of them taking the punishment of playing purely as a guard and only Dirk Nowitzki managing the feat with a single team as Bryant did. ""He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary,"" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said. Bryant's inspiration for future generations and his achievements are destined to remain immortal in the basketball realm. ""Basketball is better today because of Kobe,"" Krzyzewski said. ""And he deserves eternal appreciation for that."" – Rappler.com "

Anselmo Carlos became the 46th member of the legal profession to be killed under the Duterte administration. His driver, Marcial Mendoza, was also killed in the Tuesday morning attack. According to a Sta Rita police spot report, the 3 suspects – all on a single motorcycle – shot Carlos and Mendoza who were in a Toyota Camry in front of the San Vicente Parish Church in Sta Rita at 9 am on Tuesday. ""Unidentified male suspects...shot the victims on [their] neck, head, and chest using caliber .45,"" said the spot report prepared by Police Captain Renemer James Pornia. Carlos is the 29th lawyer killed in the Duterte administration, and the 46th in total in the legal profession, including prosecutors and judges. In March 2019, an international delegation of lawyers went on a fact-finding mission in the country to probe the killings of lawyers, and concluded that the government has not done an effective investigation into the killings. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said the Department of Justice (DOJ) will step in if there would be indications that any of the killings fall under Administrative Order No. 35, which the secretary said is focused on ""extrajudicial killings (EJKs) arising from certain advocacies."" ""We will initially let the Philippine National Police take the lead in investigating this latest incident, but if there are any indications that the case falls under AO 35, the DOJ will create a special investigating team,"" Guevarra told reporters. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Gelo Litonjua/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The over 300 Filipinos in Hubei province in China, including around 150 who are in the provincial capital of Wuhan, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV threat, may voluntarily come home, according to the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). This decision comes after a meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases on Tuesday, January 28, that discussed the Philippine government’s measures to contain the current 2019-nCoV threat. As of posting, the virus has sickened 4,515 people and killed 106. All the deaths have so far been in China – 105 in Wuhan and 1 in Beijing. While cases are concentrated in China, the virus has spread to neighboring Asian countries, as well as, Europe, North America, and Australia. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The city of Wuhan is currently on lockdown, but foreign nationals may be repatriated if their home countries order so, according to DFA Undersecretary Brigido Dulay, who was at the inter-agency task force meeting. The task force was led by the DOH, with the DFA, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Labor and Employment, Civil Aeronautics Board, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, and Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. “We have to work with Chinese authorities. Right now it’s hard to put a finger on how fast we can do it (repatriate Filipinos), but we hope to do it as quickly as possible,” Dulay said, adding that the repatriation may either be by air or by land. The task force is also discouraging “non-essential travel to China” while Chinese authorities scramble to contain the outbreak. It added that Filipinos who wish to stay in China should heed advisories from local health authorities and cooperate with efforts to quell the further spread of 2019-nCoV there. The DOH also advised overseas Filipinos in affected areas to avoid crowded places, use mask and gloves, and practice proper hygiene in order to reduce exposure to and transmission of said virus. Filipinos who are repatriated from Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province will be put on quarantine for 14 days, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. Duque added that the Philippine government was in constant communication with Chinese counterparts through the DFA. “We just have to make sure that we are to monitor the further developments,” he said. As of posting, there are no confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV in the Philippines, but the DOH revealed that it is probing 24 foreign nationals who have shown symptoms of respiratory illness and have had histories of travel to Wuhan, China. The Bureau of Immigration has also “temporarily suspended” the visa upon arrival (VUA) procedure for Chinese tourists and businessmen due to the scare. But there is no policy barring Chinese nationals in general, so those who have other valid visas can still enter the Philippines. Asked whether the Philippines should bar from entering anyone flying in from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, World Health Organization (WHO) Philippine country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said: “There is no justification for this. Certainly if there is evidence of clear, extensive transmission at a community level, that could be considered."" Abeyasinghe added that the primary measure at the moment is to monitor those showing symptoms, as well as those with history of travel to Wuhan. — Rappler.com "

Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III at the Senate hearing on the proposed 2020 budget of the Department of Labor and Employment on September 17, 2019. File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The employers of slain overseas Filipino worker (OFW) Jeanelyn Villavende have been charged with murder in Kuwait, said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III on Tuesday, January 28. Bello announced the development during a hearing of the Senate committee on labor and employment. ""I was informed that the employers have been formally charged with murder,"" Bello said, adding that the suspects are detained in a facility for high criminals. What happened to Villavende? Autopsy reports revealed the OFW was sexually abused and physically battered for weeks before she was beaten to death. Villavende had repeatedly asked to be brought back home to the Philippines at least 3 months before she died in December 2019, though her cries to her recruitment agency went unanswered. According to Bello, one of Villavende's employers worked for Kuwait's Ministry of Interior. How has the Philippines responded? Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the Duterte government welcomes the development. ""Okay 'yun kasi 'di ba, 'yun 'yung hinihingi natin (That's good because that's what we asked for) – justice. We welcome that,"" Panelo told reporters in a press briefing in Malacañang on Tuesday.

The agreement, which came at the end of a diplomatic crisis over the gruesome murder of OFW Joanna Demafelis, seeks to uphold the protection of the rights and welfare of Filipino workers in the Gulf state. Following the killing of Villavende, the Department of Labor and Employment issued a total ban on the deployment of Filipino workers to Kuwait on January 15. Bello said the ban will stay in place until justice is served for Villavende and terms of the 2018 labor agreement are incorporated in standard contracts for all OFWs in the Gulf state. – Rappler.com "
682,250406,"January 31, 2020",Rappler IQ,EXPLAINER: Visiting Forces Agreement,Michael Bueza,"President Duterte has threatened to scrap the military pact between the Philippines and the United States. Here's what you should know about it.   MANILA, Philippines – Two decades after it took effect, the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) is in danger of being terminated in the Philippines. This is after President Rodrigo Duterte threatened to scrap it, following the United States' move to cancel the visa of Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa as part of Washington's crackdown on human rights violators. A retired Philippine National Police chief, Dela Rosa is known to be the architect of Duterte's war on drugs that has resulted in thousands of deaths in a span of 3 years. Know more about the VFA in this Q&A explainer. What is the Visiting Forces Agreement? The Visiting Forces Agreement is a pact between the Philippines and the United States containing guidelines and conditions for US military and civilian personnel who are temporarily sent to the Philippines. The agreement was an affirmation of the two countries' obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) signed in 1951. The MDT is a commitment to defend each other – in accordance with constitutional processes – in the event of an armed attack by a hostile party. The VFA was crafted following the Philippine Senate's rejection in 1991 of extending the presence of US bases in the country. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), signed in April 2014 under then-president Benigno Aquino III, serves to operationalize the VFA. Military activities approved by the Philippines also fall within the context of the VFA. The executive agreement provides for increased rotational military presence of US troops, planes, and ships in the Philippines and gives them wider access to military bases in the country. In effect, as the implementing agreement of the VFA, EDCA allows the prepositioning of war materials in approved locations. It also entails capacity-building towards the modernization of the Philippines' armed forces. (READ: PH primer on military pact with US) The VFA was signed on February 10, 1998 by then-ambassador Thomas Hubbard on behalf of the US and then-foreign affairs secretary Domingo Siazon Jr on behalf of the Philippines. Former president Joseph Estrada ratified the VFA on October 5, 1998. (Estrada succeeded Fidel Ramos, who was president at the time of the VFA's signing.) On May 27, 1999, the Philippine Senate voted 18-5 to concur with the ratification, resulting in the effectivity of the VFA. The VFA also provides for a reciprocal or counterpart agreement that was signed on October 9, 1998. That agreement covers Filipino personnel temporarily sent to the US. What does the VFA cover? The VFA provides rules for the entry and departure of US personnel in the Philippines, the movement of military vessels and aircraft, and the import and export of equipment and supplies in connection with activities covered by the agreement. It also makes joint military exercises like Balikatan possible. Former foreign affairs secretary Albert del Rosario also noted that the VFA, for instance, made the quick movement of US aid to the Philippines possible after Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit in 2013. In addition, the VFA also provides guidelines in the event of a crime committed by US personnel on Philippine territory. In general, the Philippines has jurisdiction over US personnel who commit crimes in the country, and can impose sanctions and punishments in accordance with Philippine laws. If offenses are, however, committed in relation to US security and property, or committed in the performance of official duty, US military authorities assume jurisdiction over their erring personnel. Why does President Duterte want to end the VFA? The President moved to scrap the VFA after two US diplomatic actions irked him. In December 2016, Duterte warned of an ""eventual repeal or abrogation"" of the VFA after the US did not push through with an aid package for the Philippines from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an aid-giving body. Duterte, however, deferred his decision out of respect for newly-elected President Donald Trump. In January 2020, the US cancelled the visa of Senator dela Rosa over links to human rights violations, again prompting Duterte to say he will ""terminate"" the VFA within a month if the US does not fix what it had done. How is the VFA terminated? Termination will take place 180 days from the receipt of a written notification of either party to the other: ""This agreement shall remain in force until the expiration of 180 days from the date on which either party gives the other party notice in writing that it desires to terminate the agreement."" Can the VFA be terminated by the President alone? The Duterte government argues it is within the President's powers to terminate the VFA, likening it to the President's decision to leave the International Criminal Court. The Senate and the Department of National Defense seconded the argument, saying that while the Senate's concurrence was needed for the VFA to take effect, the same is not needed to end it. They pointed to Section 21, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution, which requires Senate approval when signing a treaty, but is silent when it comes to ending it. ""It is well within the right of the Philippine government to do so if it determines that the agreement no longer redounds to our national interest,"" Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said on January 24. How did others react to Duterte's threat? Senator Panfilo Lacson said on January 24 that Duterte's reaction to cancel the VFA was not commensurate to Dela Rosa's visa cancellation. (READ: Lacson questions ending VFA to get Dela Rosa's visa back) Meanwhile, ex-foreign affairs secretary Del Rosario argued that the VFA is ""imperfect"" but ""essential"" for PH-US ties. What has the Duterte gov't done so far towards termination of the VFA? On January 24, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said he has ""started"" the process of ""terminating"" the VFA, by informing the foreign relations committee of the Philippine Senate. Lorenzana said on January 24 that he will ""discuss with the President"" the various scenarios pertaining to withdrawal from the VFA. Locsin heads the Presidential Commission on Visiting Forces, while Lorenzana is the vice chairperson. On January 25, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said his department is preparing a legal memorandum on the proper procedures to terminate the VFA. On January 27, however, Guevarra said that Malacanang has ordered a ""preliminary impact assessment"" on the VFA's possible termination. ""It is my understanding that the President has threatened, but has not given an order, to terminate the VFA. That's why his office has requested us to study the potential impact of such termination,"" Guevarra said. Have camps questioned the VFA's validity and application before? Shortly after the VFA's ratification, the Supreme Court (SC) received 5 separate petitions questioning the validity of the VFA. The High Court consolidated all petitions in one case: Bayan vs. Zamora, referring to petitioner leftist group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) and defendant Ronaldo Zamora, who was executive secretary at the time the case was filed. The petitioners tried to argue that the VFA ""abdicates"" Philippine sovereignty when it comes to trying offenses committed by US personnel. On October 10, 2000, the SC dismissed their petitions, saying there was no grave abuse of discretion by the President and the Senate when they VFA was ratified. The SC also said it respects the separation of powers and the systems of checks and balances. ""True enough, rudimentary is the principle that matters pertaining to the wisdom of a legislative act are beyond the ambit and province of the courts to inquire,"" it said. The High Court did not discuss the petitioners' other points further. Other legal questions related to the VFA were heard in two more cases at the Supreme Court, said lawyer Romel Bagares of the Center for International Law and who teaches international law at the Lyceum of the Philippines University-College of Law: Has the VFA been invoked in controversial cases? The VFA was put in the spotlight in at least two criminal cases involving US soldiers, and which both concerned custody issues over accused personnel. According to Article V of the agreement, the custody of any US personnel whose case falls under Philippine jurisdiction ""shall immediately reside with United States military authorities, if they so request,"" from when the crime was committed until all court proceedings are complete. However, US military authorities shall make the defendant available to Philippine authorities ""in time for any investigative or judicial proceedings relating to the offense."" In ""extraordinary cases,"" the Philippines ""shall present its position"" regarding custody to the US government, which should take it ""into full account."" In addition, US personnel should be confined or detained ""in facilities agreed on by appropriate Philippine and United States authorities."" If the VFA ends, what will happen to other military treaties and agreements with the US? The Department of Justice said it will study the effects of the VFA's termination on the MDT and EDCA. Meanwhile, Bagares argued that executive agreements based on the VFA would have ""no leg to stand on"" if the VFA is scrapped. – with reports from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com "
683,250407,"January 28, 2020",Life & Health,Experts say China virus outbreak will last months at least,Agence France-Presse,"Researchers estimate the coronavirus will afflict a minimum of tens of thousands of people, lasting at least several months based on the first available data  FIGHTING THE VIRUS. Pedestrians wearing face masks cross a road during a Lunar New Year of the Rat public holiday in Hong Kong on January 27, 2020, as a preventative measure following a coronavirus outbreak which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Photo by Anthony Wallace/AFP ""The best case scenario, you would have something... where we go through the spring into the summer, and then it dies down,"" David Fisman, a professor at the University of Toronto who wrote an analysis of the virus for the International Society for Infectious Diseases, told AFP. ""It's not something that's going to end the next week or the next month,"" said Alessandro Vespignani, a professor at Northeastern University. He is part of a group of researchers that manages an online dashboard about the outbreak. Epidemiologists have no crystal ball. They have only piecemeal information on the new virus, which appeared in December. They use mathematical models to estimate the actual number of cases, as of the current date, and compare them to past outbreaks -- but many of their hypotheses remain uncertain. Until the past weekend, researchers thought that infected people were not contagious until they began exhibiting symptoms, such as fever, respiratory problems, and pneumonia. But Chinese authorities said Sunday they had established the opposite. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) US health authorities said Monday they had not seen evidence that asymptomatic patients can infect other people. But if they can, this would definitely change the outbreak's dynamics. The first estimates for the length of the incubation period –about two weeks – are recent. Patience In recent days, multiple experts have calculated an important parameter for any outbreak: the basic reproduction number, or ""R0."" It represents the number of people contaminated by an infected person. Estimates range from 1.4 to 3.8, according to Fisman, figures that are considered moderate. That is only an average: some patients may infect many people, while others infect only a few. ""On its own, it isn't a reason to panic,"" said Maimuna Majumder, a researcher at Harvard University and at Boston Children's Hospital. She said the rate is 1.3 for seasonal flu (which has millions of cases per year) and between two and five for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which resulted in 8,000 cases and 774 deaths, the majority in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. In comparison, the rate for measles ranges from 12 to 18. Quarantines and isolation measures, systematic hand washing and masks could help drive down the average number of infected people. If the rate falls below one, the epidemic will die down. But the effect of the control measures China has implemented won't be felt for another week or two, researchers say, based on the virus's cycle. ""The more we learn about it, the more it looks like SARS,"" said Fisman. ""SARS was controllable; hopefully this will be too. But we won't know for a few weeks."" ""It's going to be many weeks, probably months, and nobody knows where this will go,"" he added. The official number of cases is more than 4,000 in China, with more than 100 deaths, and some 50 confirmed infections outside the country. But the actual number of Chinese cases, including those not yet detected, is likely to be more than 25,000, said Vespignani, according to the analysis of the group coordinated by Northeastern. And researchers at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) estimate that the number of actual cases has currently passed 40,000. ""It's easy to get to twice or three times as much, even just in the city of Wuhan,"" the virus's epicenter, said Vespignani. ""If we start to have other larger areas affected, then those numbers are going to be much, much bigger."" He said he doesn't want to estimate the number of possible deaths. The mortality rate, until now, has hovered around three percent, but such rates have a tendency to fluctuate: they increase at the beginning as the most vulnerable patients die, then drop, and then rise again as others die. Again, only time will tell. – Rappler.com "

Mexico faces pressure to keep the migrants from crossing its northern border from US President Donald Trump, who last year threatened to impose steep tariffs if the country did not do more to stop a surge of undocumented Central Americans.

Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler Sorry – we know you're hungry, so here's what you really came for: Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory's complete menu, price list, and a few first impressions: First stop: Appetizers I don't like waiting for my main course on an empty stomach (you wouldn't like hangry me, either), so I always like having a little plate of appetizers – in this case, chips – to chip away at until the beast is tamed. Cue TFMC's House Potato Chips (P180) served with a nori aioli, an ode to Japanese seaweed.  POTATO CHIPS. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler The chips are just like what you'd find in a bag of premium, store-bought kettle chips – they're thin, light, and crispy-crunchy in every bite – a true ASMR dream. They're also not as oily, yet still taste freshly-fried. We also tried the Sweet Corn Tempura (P260) served with truffle aioli – imagine balls of sweet, bright-yellow Japanese corn kernels jumbled together into a bite-sized ball, then fried together in crunchy tempura batter until golden-brown.  SWEET CORN TEMPURA. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler Tempura and truffle – who knew? BTW: The truffle flavor, although noticeable, isn't overpowering. Other appetizers include Chicken Karaage (P295), served with a house mayonnaise. Second stop: Sandwiches TMFC's sandwiches are made not just for merienda, but for any time of day. They're pretty filling, owing to the freshly-made sourdough bread they use.  BEEF RIB SANDWICH. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler We tried the 12-Hour Short Rib Sandwich (P485) – pulled beef ribs that have been cooked for 12 hours, blessing carnivores with tender, fall-off-the-bone barbecued beef. The strong, savory flavor is contrasted by the parsley aioli, the pickled red cabbage slaw, and the fresh mixed greens inside. Plus points if you like your sourdough bread buttered and toasted extra crunchy, too. Other sandwiches on the menu include: Third stop: Fluffy, jiggly pancakes These Japanese souffle pancakes are thick, tall, fluffy, and airy, with just the right jiggle. With their soft, custardy interior and crisp but fluffy exterior, I can understand why they're the star of the TMFC show.  CREME BRULEE. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler The Creme Brulee Pancake (P265) – two pancakes doused in a mildly sweet, vanilla crème anglaise (a light, custard-like sauce for pastries) are finished off with torched sugar on top. I've never had these before, so I was quite surprised to remember my childhood mamon baon upon first bite. It has that airy, chiffon-like feel initially, but firmer, and with more bite. Its sponge-like surface also helps to absorb the sauces better. But don't be fooled – a few bites of this can start to fill you up, since it's pretty dense.  SUMMER BERRIES. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler If you like tart, berry-based syrups on your pancakes, try the Summer Berries Pancake (P315), topped with a colorful mixed berry compote (I was pleased to see whole strawberries and blueberries!) and served with nama cream. I'm not a super sweet tooth, but I appreciated these souffle pancakes for what they were worth – they're not overtly sweet, surprisingly, and they're between firm and fluffy, like a denser chiffon cake. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler Heads-up, though: They're freshly-made upon order, so expect a waiting time of 30 minutes or more. You can get it just Plain (P210) with maple syrup, or as Chocolate (P265). Fourth stop: All rise for omurice Another crowd favorite is the omurice – the famous Japanese ""food porn"" delicacy that features flavored rice underneath a creamy omelette, split in the middle to ooze sauce all over the plate. They look extra delicious in anime shows, so I was curious to have my first try. We tried the Chicken and Cheese Omurice (P350), which was huge. The omelette is already opened up for you, so it's ready to eat – there's tomato rice pilaf mixed in with chicken bites, underneath a scrambled egg, and surrounded by a cheese bechamel sauce. OMURICE. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler OMURICE. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler  Other omurice variants include the Hayashi Beef (P395) and the Chicken and Tomato (P315). Fifth stop: The mains And if your jean buttons aren't popping yet, props to you – there may still be room for TMFC's main entrees! We tried the pescetarian-friendly Salmon Teriyaki Gratin (P485), which was probably one of my favorite things on the menu. Strips of salmon are set atop a heap of silky, truffled mashed potatoes. SALMON GRATIN. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler SALMON GRATIN. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler Drizzled on top was a viscous, sweet-savory teriyaki sauce, and topping everything off were mozzarrella shavings, leeks, and sesame seeds. Pile on every element onto one spoon, and you're guaranteed a mouthful of flavor – salmon, teriyaki, cheese, and truffle. Yes, the price is a bit on the steep end, but for fresh salmon and a truffled side dish, it could be worth the occasional splurge. Other main dishes include: Last but not least: Dessert No, we didn't forget about the Milk Pie (P100/piece) – a freshly-baked, crisp puff pastry hugging a cool, Hokkaido milk-cream filling, similar to a lighter, less sweet bavarian custard. MILK PIES. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler MILK PIES. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler I didn't think I'd like it at first – my first bite was all sugared, crunchy pastry – but the second bite changed my mind. The milk pie is generously filled with the Hokkaido filling, which isn't overly sweet but still creamy, sans the umay. They're best served chilled! Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler If you're a fan of the Cow Cow Ice soft-serve ice cream, you can get it here too for dessert. There's the Hokkaido Milk (P150) flavor and the Hokkaido Cheese (P170), a mix of gouda cheese and cream cheese. COW COW ICE. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler COW COW ICE. Photo by Steph Arnaldo/Rappler  I enjoyed it with a milk cheesecake add-on (P120), which was pretty tiny but yummy nonetheless. You can opt for a cookie add-on (P60), too. Thirsty? There's iced and hot coffee, freshly-brewed tea, and flavored iced teas available. The rest of the menu Pasta Waffles Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory can be found at the ground level of Estancia Mall's East Wing, Capitol Commons, Pasig City.

The Women for Progress Movement in Albay helps Taal Volcano eruption evacuees by donating their sweet potato harvest. Photo by Rhaydz B. Barcia/Rappler ALBAY, Philippines  –  The Women for Progress Movement in Albay, an association of women planters from Mayon Volcano in Albay, harvested 30 sacks of kamote (sweet potatoes) for Batangas evacuees displaced by the Taal Volcano eruption. With the help of Albay 3rd District Representative Fernando Cabredo, women from the towns of Guinobatan, Oas, Polangui, Libon, Pio Duran, and Jovella said they would deliver the donation to evacuees of Agoncillo, Batangas on Wednesday, January 29. The town is located within the 7-km danger zone. Though several evacuees have already returned to their homes after the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) downgraded the Taal Volcano from Alert Level 4 to Alert Level 3, many Batangueños still remained in evacuation centers. Areas within a 7-km radius from the main crater are still off-limits for residents. The women of Albay are not new to disasters having survived Mayon Volcano eruptions and strong typhoons like Tisoy and Ursula.  This was why Cabredo said the donation was a way for them to help people facing difficult circumstances they were already familiar with. “The hardworking and generous women planters of Albay would love to bring hope and courage to the victims of the Taal Volcano eruption by donating fresh and newly harvested kamote,” Cabredo said. The Women for Progress Movement was organized by former Albay 3rd District Representative Fernando Gonzalez in 2016. It is now headed by retired public school teacher Evelyn Ragos from Polangui General Comprehensive High School. The movement started as the Taranuman sa Barangay project, which was organized after Typhoon Nina hit Albay on December 25, 2016. Its aim is to provide a source of livelihood for women in Albay through planting vegetables and other root crops in backyards. Since then, members of the movement have continued with the project, providing fresh vegetables in Albay's local markets, despite the  passing typhoons and the constant threat of the Mayon Volcano eruption. – Rappler.com "

689,250413,"January 28, 2020",Tech Features,Agitation as online world grapples with Kobe’s legacy as star and accused,Gelo Gonzales,"On Twitter, those bringing up the rape allegations against the former NBA great are swiftly lambasted  KOBE BRYANT. The former NBA great appears at a press event in Manila. File photo by Czeasar Dancel/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – They were always going to come up. The 2003 rape allegations against the now tragic figure Kobe Bryant are popping up in small corners here and there, a day after the fateful helicopter accident in Calabasas. The most high-profile instance belongs to Washington Post reporter Felicia Sonmez, who has perhaps unwittingly put herself at the vanguard. A tweet, posted hours after the crash, linking to an article about the 2003 rape case triggered massive enmity in Twitter, with users berating the reporter for her perceived insensitivity and poor timing. The tweet earned the reporter a suspension for supposedly failing her company’s ethics code and jeopardizing the work of her Washington Post colleagues, at least according to managing editor Tracy Grant. The colleagues, on the other hand, do not appear to agree, petitioning to have the reporter reinstated. The move to have the reporter on “administrative leave” drew outrage, this time from fellow Post journalists – more than 200 of them. An anonymous source told Vanity Fair: “There’s incredible outrage. The outrage is like nothing I’ve ever seen here...People just feel like it was way over the top.” The Washington Post Guild issued a statement supporting Sonmez: Our statement in support of our colleague, Felicia Sonmez: https://t.co/2GDbANeybb  Erik Wemple, a media critic, ran a piece on the Post website itself, called the suspension “misguided.” “What did Sonmez do to deserve this brushback? She tweeted out a very good story from the Daily Beast,” said Wemple. The Daily Beast story was written by Marlow Stern. Grant, the managing editor, was also reportedly concerned that the tweet pertained to a subject matter that was outside the reporter’s coverage area. To which Wemple clapped back: “...if journalists at The Post are prone to suspension for tweeting stories off their beats, the entire newsroom should be on administrative leave.” Other reporters and public figures have also come out with their own tweets that resurface the 2003 case. They’ve all been met with the same reaction that Sonmez faced.

He was also a rapist. And all of these truths can exist simultaneously. As was the case with Sonmez tweet, the timing, according to many of the Twitter users replying to the posts, could have been better: Did you even pause and ask yourself “is the day this man, his daughter, and another family died the day I should post this or should I wait a few days?” If the answer is no, then you need to examine why the question didn’t occur to you.— Captain Caveman (@BenHardee) January 27, 2020 Did you even pause and ask yourself “is the day this man, his daughter, and another family died the day I should post this or should I wait a few days?” If the answer is no, then you need to examine why the question didn’t occur to you.

You couldn’t wait a few days for this?— Derek Wilczynski (@derekwilc) January 27, 2020 Because you are a sociopath. You couldn’t wait a few days for this?  While there are those arguing that the case had been dismissed, and therefore immaterial, one gets the sense that a considerable portion do not deny that the rape case is part of the Kobe mythos – the big, bulging black eye in an otherwise sterling resume, that through purposeful strategy and the blinding sheen of medals and trophies, has managed to generally stay out of public view. It’s not so different from us giving Manny Pacquiao a pass for his various gaffes because he remains an entertainer in the ring – a sort of gladiatorial immunity, untouchable as long as you’ve got the crowd behind you. So when is the right time to discuss the Kobe case? Well, how much heat can you take? It’s an inconvenient truth, but one that can’t be reduced to a mere footnote as we form and cement our views on Kobe’s true, overall legacy as we speak. That statue is being sculpted right now – of a sportsman nonpareil but one that, we must remember, a human who at one point caused significant pain on another. A parting thought taken from the aforementioned Eric Wemple: “The backlash that alighted upon Sonmez stems from the ancient wisdom that urges folks not to speak ill of the dead. It’s a fine rule for everyone except for historians and journalists, upon whom the public relies to provide warts-and-all look-backs on the lives of influential people.” “Bryant clearly qualifies, as does the particular incident that Sonmez was flagging in her tweet: Though precisely what happened in that hotel room may never be known, as [Marlow] Stern concedes, there’s a lot that is known.” – Rappler.com "

""If this is true then he might have been infected by tourists from Wuhan. And if so, this would be the first person-to-person transmission in Japan,"" the official added. The other cases so far confirmed in Japan all involve people who have been to Wuhan. Japan has imposed new checks on travellers arriving from China, and is planning to dispatch a plane to Wuhan on Tuesday night to evacuate Japanese nationals from the city. The plane is expected to bring back around 200 nationals, of some 650 who have asked to be repatriated, authorities said. – Rappler.com "

The loss relegated the Bacolod-based squad back to the AFC Cup where it will defend its title for the fourth time in the Philippines Football League in March. Still, reaching the 3rd round of the qualifying playoffs remains as the best finish for a Philippine club. Even if the Busmen entered the match as the underdogs without the presence of Stephan Schrock, Mike Ott and Sean Kane in the starting lineup, Ceres held off the Japanese in the scoreless first half. Sei Muroya opened the scoreline in the 48th minute as he managed to break free from the Ceres defense and fire a shot past Muller.

In a resolution by the SC Second Division promulgated November 27, 2019, but released only to media on Tuesday, January 28, the High Court approved the domestic adoption process for the couple, residents in the Philippines since 2009. (We are withholding their names for privacy reasons) The Makati Regional Trial Court (RTC) earlier rejected the petition for domestic adoption, saying the case should undergo the inter-country adoption mode. Siding with the couple, the SC has now directed the RTC to ""continue with dispatch the adoption proceedings with change of name involving the minor."" ""One small step for a foreigner-couple trying to adopt a Filipino, a giant leap for an abandoned child to secure a bright future,"" the SC Public Information Office (PIO) said on Tuesday. The SC said that if the lower court order were to be followed, and the case is referred to the inter-country adoption mode, the proceedings will just be delayed, ""a matter that would be clearly prejudicial to the interest of the adoptee and the petitioners."" ""Settled is the rule that in adoption proceedings, the welfare of the child is of paramount interest,"" said the 2nd Division in the resolution penned by Associate Justice Ramon Paul Hernando with concurrences from Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas Bernabe and Associate Justices Andres Reyes Jr, Henri Paul Inting and Rodil Zalameda. (READ: Senate approves bill simplifying adoption process) The case The couple took custody of the girl from the  Department of Social Welfare Development (DSWD) in 2013 when she was barely a year old. Previously, when she was 22 days old, the DSWD rescued her in the province when her biological mother tried to sell her in exchange for fare. The couple, both gainfully employed, filed a petition to legally adopt the child under the Domestic Adoption Act. In 2017, the RTC said the case does not fall under the domestic adoption but instead under inter-country adoption which should be referred to the Inter-Country Adoption Board (ICAB.) The couple lost their 2 appeals, which prompted them to go to the Court of Appeals (CA) in 2018. But they were denied because the CA said the appeal was filed out of time. The SC said the Domestic Adoption Act was clear in saying that it covers ""any alien who has been living in the Philippines for at least 3 continuous years prior to the filing of the petition for adoption."" Cases under this classification are handled by the RTC with jurisdiction. Inter-Country adoption, on the other hand, covers aliens or Filipino citizens who are permanently residing abroad. Cases under this classification are handled by the ICAB. ""The Court finds that petitioners' petition for adoption was appropriately filed under the Domestic Adoption Act in order for the appropriate family court or RTC to take cognizance thereof,"" said the SC. The CA said the couple violated the 60-day period because the court counted from when the RTC denied their first appeal. The couple were counting from then the RTC denied their 2nd appeal. ""This Court finds that a relaxation of the rules of procedure is necessary in the instant case in order to promote the best interest of the adoptee child,"" said the SC. – Rappler.com "

Chinese nationals arriving from Guangzhou, China are seen wearing face mask at the arrival area of Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 in Pasay City. Photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Since the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus or nCoV,  false information about the deadly disease has also spread like a virus on a global scale. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) Several fact-checking organizations that are signatory to Poynter's International Fact Checking Network (IFCN) collaborated to combat the disinformation on 2019-nCoV. (READ: Fact checkers worldwide team up to debunk false info about 2019-nCoV) The Philippines only confirmed on Thursday, January 30, its first case of 2019-nCoV. Rappler consolidated the list of coronavirus-related claims that we fact-checked. We also added the 3 biggest trends of misinformation from Poynter’s article published on Tuesday, January 28. Here are the false claims: 1. Claim: 'SARS' case reported in clinic at Shangri-La Plaza A chain message circulated on Tuesday, January 14, warning people to avoid going to Shangri-La Plaza, a mall in Mandaluyong City, because of a supposed case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) reported in one of the mall's medical clinics. However, the Department of Health (DOH) and Healthway Medical both issued advisories denying the claim in the chain message. 2. Claim: Confirmed cases' of coronavirus at PBCom Tower in Makati “Confirmed cases” of the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV were recorded at the Philippine Bank of Communications (PBCom) Tower in Makati City, according to a message that circulated Friday, January 24. Speaking to reporters on January 24, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo maintained that there was still no confirmed case of the 2019-nCov in the Philippines on that day. The management of PBCom Tower also said there was “no truth” to the information. 3. Claim: 'Patient tested positive' for 2019-nCoV in Makati Medical Center A message saying a “patient tested positive” for the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) at the Makati Medical Center circulated on messaging apps and social media platforms on Monday, January 27. The fact was, there was still no confirmed case of the 2019-nCoV in the Philippines as of January 28, according to the Department of Health (DOH). 4. Claim: Chinese patient in Alabang clinic, hospital tested ‘positive’ for coronavirus A screenshot of a text message that spread on Facebook claimed that there is a Chinese patient at the Hi-Precision Diagnostics clinic in Alabang who was tested positive for the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. In a press briefing on Tuesday, January 28, the Department of Health (DOH) announced that there was still no confirmed case of 2019-nCoV in the country. The patient at Asian Hospital and Medical Center in Alabang, Muntinlupa City is among the 24 persons under investigation (PUIs) for the possible 2019-nCoV infection. 5. Claim: Novel coronavirus a 'type of rabies' A Facebook post claimed that the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a ""type of rabies"" that can be contracted by eating bats. In a press briefing on Tuesday, January 28, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III clarified that the 2019-nCoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family of viruses. Meanwhile, rabies is from Rhabdoviridae. 6. Claim: 2019-nCoV is created in laboratory; new vaccines are invented In the United States, social media posts falsely claimed that the 2019-nCoV was created in the laboratory and was patented to boost sales on the vaccine. The vaccine for the Wuhan virus was already invented and supposedly available in the market. But the truth is, there was no vaccine created yet at the time when the claim spread. According to the fact-checks done by US fact-checking organizations such as Lead Stories, Fact-Check.org and PolitiFact, the existing patent claimed by social media posts is related to the different viruses in the coronavirus family such as SARS. There is no current patent for the new virus. The same claim was also debunked by a group of fact-checkers in Brazil and Canada. 7. Claim: Drugs to treat patient with 2019-nCoV Since Taiwan is geographically near China, many false procedures were spread that supposedly could cure or prevent the 2019-nCoV. Different versions of the claim said salty water and acetic acid could prevent one from getting the Wuhan virus. Others said substances like steroids and ethanol could kill it. The Taiwan Fact-Checking Center said 2019-nCoV does not have approve vaccines and drugs to treat the disease during the time when the claim circulated. 8. Claim: 2019-nCoV comes from bat soup, laboratories False claims about the origin of the 2019-nCoV surfaced on social media and news cycles in countries like Brazil and the United Kingdom. Supposedly, the virus is linked to eating bat soup. However, there was no proof that supports the claim. It is still not clear which animals may have transmitted the virus to humans, according to Aos Fatos, a fact-checking unit in Brazil. Some fact-checkers also debunked the conspiracies that 2019-nCoV originated from laboratories in China. Italy-based fact-checking unit Pagella Politica found ""no evidence that the coronavirus 2019-nCoV was born in a China laboratory.” 9. Claim: Video of ""market in Wuhan, China"" Following the outbreak, a video of a market with wild animals like bats was shared on social media. The caption says it was taken in Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. However, outlets like Agencia Lupa in Brazil as well as Factly and Boom Factcheck in India showed that the market in the video is in Langowan, Indonesia. 10. Claim: “10,000 dead” in Wuhan Many online users shared a January 24 story of the Geller Report saying that 10,000 people have died in Wuhan, China, due to the coronavirus. News groups and fact checkers – like Politifact and FactCheck.org in the United States, Newtral in Spain, ColombiaCheck in Colombia, and Tempo in Indonesia – debunked this claim and raised questions on Geller Report's ""death toll."" They all pointed to the official numbers from Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization, which stand at only over 200 deaths as of this writing. 11. Claim: People “fainting” or “lying on the ground” due to coronavirus Various posts have popped up on social media showing people fainting, collapsing, or lying on the ground in China, supposedly due to the virus. However, many of these videos, as fact-checkers found out, are not related to the outbreak. For instance, a photo of people lying down on a road supposedly in China was a mass activity for an art project in Frankfurt, Germany, in March 2014 to commemorate the victims of concentration camps during World War II, according to Tempo (Indonesia), Agencia Lupa (Brazil), and Agence France-Presse. Videos showing security camera footage of individuals collapsing in China, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia, were not due to the coronavirus. The persons in these cases fainted due to an unrelated hospital incident, fatigue, and heart failure, respectively. – Rappler.com "

Other confirmed cases in Europe of the viral outbreak have so far involved patients who had recently been to China. In this instance, the 33-year-old German attended a training session held by a visiting Chinese colleague on January 21 at the office of car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf, in Germany's southern Bavaria region. The Chinese woman ""started to feel sick on the flight home on January 23,"" said Andreas Zapf, head of the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety. The German man tested positive for the virus on Monday evening, January 27, after reporting flu-like symptoms. He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he ""was doing well."" A spokeswoman for the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's center for disease prevention and control, told Agence France-Presse the German case appeared to be the first instance of a ""human-to-human transmission"" outside Asia. Vietnam and Japan have also each reported a patient testing positive for the new coronavirus without having travelled to China. The Chinese woman working for Webasto immediately sought medical attention on her return to China. She was confirmed to have caught the virus, which has spread rapidly in recent weeks after first emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The woman had recently visited her parents in the Wuhan region, Zapf said. In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China ""for at least the next two weeks."" Health officials are checking some 40 people that the two infected workers have been in contact with recently, including colleagues and family members. The virus has so far killed 106 people and infected over 4,000 – the bulk of them in and around Wuhan. Cases have also been reported in a string of other countries, including the United States, France, Australia and Japan. – Rappler.com "

Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Roger Federer admitted he was ""incredibly lucky"" after pulling off one of the greatest escapes of his career, saving 7 match points to beat Tennys Sandgren for a place in the Australian Open semifinals. In a drama-packed match, the normally ice-cool Swiss was slapped with a warning for swearing and needed a rare medical timeout for a groin injury before winning 6-3, 2-6, 2-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-3 on Tuesday, January 28. The six-time champion's reward is a showdown against either long-time rival Novak Djokovic of Serbia or big-serving Milos Raonic of Canada. ""I don't deserve this one, but I'm standing here and obviously very happy,"" said Federer, 38, who became the oldest man in 43 years to make the last four at Melbourne Park after Ken Rosewall. ""I just said [to myself while losing], I believe in miracles,"" he added. ""I got incredibly lucky tonight, today – I don't even know what time it is."" The victory was his 102nd at Melbourne Park, surpassing his tally at Wimbledon to make the Australian Open his most successful Slam in terms of matches won. Federer said he felt the groin injury midway through the 2nd set and was ""upset about the pain I was feeling,"" but is hopeful it is not serious. ""Hopefully we'll find out that it's actually nothing bad, that it was just the groin that went really tight from playing a lot, who knows what, from nerves,"" he said, having now played 14 sets in his last 3 matches. ""I don't know. I'm hopeful. We'll find out tonight, tomorrow. The next day we'll see how it goes."" In two decades of playing the Australian Open, he had never lost to a player ranked as low as Sandgren's 100, with his biggest upset coming against 54th-ranked Arnaud Clement way back in 2000. The unheralded American had shown he could be a danger to the 20-time Grand Slam winner, having already beaten 8th seed Matteo Berrettini and 12th seed Fabio Fognini. And he gave the Swiss star a massive scare. Federer rattled Both players fought off break points against their opening service games as they sized each other up. It was only a matter of time, though, before Federer broke and it came in the sixth game as he began figuring out Sandgren's game, forcing errors as he took the set. But Sandgren was not ready to surrender, breaking twice in the 2nd set as Federer's touch abandoned him, sending down 15 unforced errors. Playing in the mid-afternoon sun, he continued to struggle in the 3rd set, broken in his opening service game with the crowd stunned into silence. Federer was rattled. He worked 3 break points when 2-0 down and when Sandgren saved two of them, the Swiss was warned for an audible obscenity, reported by the line judge. The normally unflappable star confronted the umpire and then lost 3 more points, again having words with the official before taking a near nine-minute medical timeout. ""I found it a bit tough,"" he said of the penalty. ""It's not like I'm known to throw around words and whatever. It's not like the whole stadium heard it either."" Federer returned to hold serve but his movement was hampered and he never threatened, losing the set with another 15 unforced errors. He grimly hung on in the 4th set, saving 3 match points at 5-4 and it went to a tiebreaker where more drama was in store as a ball kid collided with Sandgren at the changeover. Federer incredibly saved another 4 match points before winning the tiebreak 10-8, sending the crowd into a frenzy. His confidence sky-high and his touch returning, he rolled through the deciding set for a famous victory to reach the Melbourne semifinals for a 15th time. – Rappler.com "

This means the bill will only have to go through a 3rd and final reading before successfully hurdling the House. If passed into law, HB 5869 would define electronic violence or ICT (information communications technology)-related violence as any act that involves the “use or exploitation of data or any form of information and communications technology which causes or is likely to cause mental, emotional, or psychological distress or suffering to the woman and her children.” The bill provides an expansive list of prohibited forms of electronic violence, from the unauthorized sharing of lewd videos, to the creation of fake social media accounts aimed with “ill-intent or malice” against women and children.

Calabarzon police carried out the most crucial tasks to ensure residents were safe from the wrath of Taal Volcano – from evacuating people, manning checkpoints, and conducting patrols in areas under lockdown to make sure houses and establishments were not looted. More than 1,000 police outside Calabarzon were deployed to Batangas and Cavite to aid the region. The military sent troops to help in disaster response too. At least 11 towns in Batangas were placed on total lockdown, while 3 others were on partial lockdown. The police had to face angry residents who tried to get past them at checkpoints. After state volcanologists recommended the forced evacuation of stubborn residents who stayed within the 14-kilometer danger zone, police had to evacuate them all within 48 hours starting January 21. Talisay was among the worst hit towns and among the first to be placed under a complete lockdown. ""Everybody is a victim dito sa volcanic eruption na 'to eh.

It's not, it's a totally, completely different family of viruses. This is Coronaviridae, this is the family under which 2019 nCoV belongs,"" Duque said.

710,250434,"January 29, 2020",Philippines,House seeks stronger regulation of e-cigarette use by minors,Michelle Abad,"The House is building on the provisions of the recently-passed excise tax law, such as the ban on flavored e-liquids for e-cigarettes that make it appealing to young people  REGULATION. Flavored e-cigarettes apart from tobacco and menthol flavors are now prohibited for sale in the Philippines. Photo from Shutterstock MANILA, Philippines – The House committees on health and trade and industry approved on Tuesday, January 28, the creation of a technical working group (TWG) that would craft stronger regulation of minors' use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or e-cigarettes. This comes about a week after President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act 11467 on new excise taxation rates for alcohol and tobacco products. The law also now prohibits the sale of e-liquids or “juices” that are not tobacco- or menthol-flavored, in an effort to reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to young people. The House TWG will consolidate the 11 bills so far seeking to regulate the use, sale, packaging, distribution, and advertisement of ENDS. Cagayan de Oro Representative Rufus Rodriguez said it was now the time to do away with “motherhood statements” on the need to allow access to less harmful alternatives to smokers while also preventing underaged use of ENDS, and proceed to the “hows” of regulation. On June 14, 2019, the Department of Health released Administrative Order 2019-0007 in an attempt to regulate e-cigarettes, only to be met by court injunctions by members of the ENDS industry. Rodriguez advised the Food and Drug Administration to hold the release of any regulation as to not preempt the decisions of the TWG. The regulation dilemma Leading e-cigarette company JUUL Labs attended the House hearing on Tuesday. Following the scandal and crackdown in the United States, JUUL strengthened its self-regulation to minimize youth access and appeal in its operations as it expanded abroad, and to the Philippines in June 2019. Its mission here was to help the 16 million smokers transition to an alternative. However, House health committee vice chair Joet Garcia said the context of the Philippines is that many vape users are either non-smokers or underaged. “You’re helping the 16 million, but we’re also trying to help the people who do not smoke,” Garcia told the JUUL representatives in the hearing. JUUL APAC South president Kenneth Bishop said that even before the law was passed, they stopped ordering flavored pods for the Philippine market, especially after United States President Donald Trump announced the ban on non-tobacco and non-menthol flavors in the US last January 2. Trade and industry committee vice chair Manuel Zubiri believes the priority of the regulation debate must be focused on prevention of underaged use, especially since there are harmful effects of e-cigarettes that have yet to be discovered. “We are not 100% sure about long-term effects. And we have kids 12 to 14 years old using them. So we have to be extra careful,” he said. The panel and resource persons also looked at regulations of other countries, such as Israel, which has minimal black packaging on JUUL products with straightforward text as labels. Sin taxes on nicotine salt products, a common form of e-liquid, are to be taxed at P37 per mL in 2020, as per the recently signed excise tax law. – Rappler.com "

Novak Djokovic stretches his winning streak against Milos Raonic to 10 matches. Photo from Twitter/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Rampant defending champion Novak Djokovic powered past Milos Raonic on Tuesday January 28 to set up a blockbuster Australian Open semifinal against Roger Federer. The Serbian world No. 2, despite trouble with his contact lenses, tamed the big-serving Canadian, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7/1), as he targets an eighth Melbourne Park crown and 17th Grand Slam title. Six-time champion Federer is next after pulling off one of his most memorable comebacks against unseeded American Tennys Sandgren that saw him save an incredible 7 match points. The 38-year-old great Federer, the oldest man to reach the Melbourne semifinals since Ken Rosewall 43 years ago, came through the action-packed clash, 6-3, 2-6, 2-6, 7-6 (10/8), 6-3. He fended off 7 match points and was slapped with a warning for swearing, while taking a rare medical timeout for a groin injury that hampered his movement. But he dug deep to set up yet another showdown with his old rival Djokovic. The pair are all-conquering in Melbourne, sharing 12 of the last 14 titles between them. They have played each other 49 times, with the Serb in front 26-23. ""I have tremendous respect for Roger,"" said Djokovic, who became emotional in his on-court interview when asked about the tragic death in a helicopter crash of Kobe Bryant, a personal friend. ""The match-ups I have had against Roger and Rafa (Nadal) have made me the player I am today,"" he added. ""May the best player win."" While Federer – into a record 15th Australian Open semifinal – has labored through 14 sets in his last 3 matches, Djokovic has had a much easier ride, dropping just one set all tournament. But the world No. 3 Swiss star insisted he felt fine. ""It really depends sometimes how you're feeling inside, how much it takes away from you. But I must say I feel pretty good right now,"" said the 20-time Grand Slam champion. His comeback against Sandgren was the stuff of legend, with win his 102nd at Melbourne Park, surpassing his tally at Wimbledon to make the Australian Open his most successful Slam in terms of matches won. After comfortably taking the opening set, he felt the groin strain midway through the following set. He wasn not moving well and making too many errors. He took a medical timeout but lost the set and the next one. But he seemed to get a second wind and saved 4 match points at 5-4 down in the 4th set and another 3, winning the tie-breaker and romping to victory as the adoring crowd went into a frenzy. Federer admitted he was ""incredibly lucky"" to still be in the tournament, but he planned to make the most if it. Focused The fit-again Raonic reached the Melbourne semifinals in 2016, when he lost to Andy Murray, and the quarters on 3 other occasions, including last year. He had failed to beat Djokovic in 9 previous attempts, but possesses a monster serve and was unbeaten in 59 straight service games heading into their clash. That all changed when he faced his nemesis, perhaps the best returner in tennis. ""I felt great on court, I was very focused,"" said Djokovic. He threatened straight away, earning break points on the Raonic serve several times before finally converting to take the set and snap the Canadian's run. After the 63-game streak on his serve, his next amounted to just one game, broken again in the fourth game of the 2nd set as Djokovic took a stranglehold. The relentless Serb, who has won 11 straight matches this season, went toe-to-toe with the Canadian in the 3rd set when at 4-4, he called for new contact lenses, which turned into a medical timeout. Raonic was not impressed that he did not wait until the changeover. Djokovic appeared to struggle with his vision on his return, but it quickly came back into focus as he raced through the tiebreaker to book his ticket to the semifinal. – Rappler.com "

Rohingya children jump over on sewage concrete sections at Balukhali refugee camp in Ukhia on December 10, 2019. File photo by Munir Uz Zaman/AFP DHAKA, Bangladesh – Rohingya children living in Bangladesh refugee camps will be allowed to receive a formal education after a change of heart by Dhaka in a move welcomed by right activists. Nearly one million Rohingya, including more than half a million children, live in the squalid and crowded camps near the southeastern border with Myanmar, where many had fled from in 2017 after a brutal military crackdown. The children were previously barred from studying the curriculums used in Bangladesh and Myanmar, and instead received primary education in temporary learning centers set up by the UN children's agency UNICEF. ""We don't want a lost generation of Rohingya. We want them to have education. They will follow Myanmar curricula,"" Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Tuesday, January 28. The decision came after a meeting of a national taskforce set up by the government. Local media reported that a pilot program involving more than 10,000 students would be launched soon, with UNICEF and Dhaka jointly designing the curriculum. The refugee children will be schooled in Myanmar history and culture up to age 14, and will also receive skills training so they can take up jobs back in Myanmar when they return home, the foreign ministry said. ""I can't express my joy with words...generations of Rohingya hardly had any education in their homeland in Myanmar as they were discriminated there and were robbed of their citizenship,"" Rohingya youth leader and human rights activist Rafique bin Habib said.

UN representative in Bangladesh Mia Seppo told AFP the move would ""make it easier for them to go back home to Myanmar when the time is right for returns."" Some Rohingya children have used fake Bangladeshi identity cards and hidden their ethnic identities to enroll in local schools. Authorities last year expelled scores of them from schools in a drive condemned by rights groups. Tens of thousands of other Rohingya Muslim children were also educated in madrassas set up by Islamic groups in the camps.

714,250438,"January 29, 2020",Arts and Culture,Ben-Hur Villanueva and the sculptor who sought to rest with Christ,Frank Cimatu,"The sculptor passed away on January 25 at the age of 81  Photo courtesy of Bumbo Villanueva BAGUIO CITY, Philippines – Among Baguio artists, Ben-Hur was the Villanueva who decided to leave behind. It was his younger brother Roberto who was the wanderlust wunderkind. Roberto was among the founders of the Baguio Arts Guild and Café by Ruins. A shaman, Roberto went around the world and in the spirit world, making ephemeral art and performance art. The rare times he went into visual art, they were huge like a labyrinth, a mosaic of seeds enough to feed a community and a painting as huge as the ceiling of the Baguio Convention Center. Panhumuko, his installation to appease Mt. Pinatubo, was as huge as an Aeta pueblo. Ben-Hur had a more subdued arts career. Born in San Mateo, Rizal in 1938, he studied in Manila and Quezon City for his basic schooling and took up fine arts at the Philippine Women’s University. In 1961, he began to teach art at Ateneo de Manila Grade School for 30 years. ”While teaching in the AGH, Villanueva was also active in various art activities in arts and design, joining local and international exhibitions and competitions such as the 1971 7th Biennale International in France, the 1975 7th Segunda Biennale de la Habana in Cuba, the 1988 International Conference for TV Programming in Japan, and the 1989 World Annual Arts Festival & Conference in Finland,” wrote his student, John Paul Lakan OIivares, in his tribute blog post, “Sculpting Futures.” “After retirement, Villanueva continued participating in such events; such as the 2005 Singapore Arts Festival, the 2006 16th Pyeongtaek International Art Festival in South Korea, and the 2006 15th Lantern of the East International Art Festival in America,” Olivares added. Printmaker Pandy Aviado wrote: “He was a great art teacher. Among his students were Noynoy Aquino and Arch. Bong Recio. He was also a good sculptor. Along with Mrs. (Araceli) Dans, he made puppets for an Art program of the Educational TV, way ahead of Sesame Street. He was also a great boogie and chacha-cha dancer.”  Benhur on the left with Lisa Macuja-Elizalde, wife Lolit and son Bumbo. Photo courtesy of Bumbo Villanueva In 1992, Ben-Hur retired from Ateneo and decided to migrate to Baguio to be with his brother. But Roberto became ill in 1994 and died in 1995. Desiree Caluza, a writer now based in Canada, recalled when she talked to Ben-Hur about his brother. “It was his anecdotal life that Ben-hur fondly recalled.'Oh, Robert told me his unforgettable experience on this particular island in Palawan. There were this beautiful sea and rich trees around. He was so carried away with the beauty that he saw that he suddenly had to undress himself to be totally naked, he said he wanted to be one with nature so he marched towards the water and just swam,' Ben-hur said with animation in his voice. ""'Oh, and he also loved butterflies, he saw many of them in the island,' he added. The last minutes of Robert's life in his death bed became a sterling bonding for both brothers. Ben-hur was there to help release Robert's spirit. 'I held his legs and feet, and massaged them, and then I told him to spread his wings and fly,'"" Caluza said. After Roberto’s death, Ben-hur started sculpting in earnest. His brass figures ala Solomon Saprid became more Cordilleran. They seemed floating or fighting in the air with bases mostly in river stones. He held one-man shows at Christine Gallery and many of his first patrons were his students, who remained in awe of him. In 1998, he opened his museum, Arko ni Apo Gallery in Long-long at La Trinidad beside Tam-awan Gallery back when Bencab was still at the helm. By that time, his son Bumbo was also starting as an artist. First following the footsteps of his uncle, Bumbo later became a sculptor like his father, although his works are more honed on mystical themes. “The Arko ni Apo Gallery, an art space which he established in Baguio, was a testament to Ben-hur's openness to the Baguio community which he and his family embraced. The gallery was also his workshop but it was also a dining area for 'eating occasions.' The gallery was always open to anyone who was interested to talk about art, spirituality, and life as a whole. And Ben-hur and the whole family made sure that all visitors felt accepted and comfortable,"" wrote Caluza. Benhur’s first major sculptural artwork is Ang Mandaragat, which he made in 1981. It was the grand prize winner of the Metro Manila Beautification Competition then sponsored by First Lady Imelda Marcos. In 1998, Benhur’s design for the statue of Andres Bonifacio to be erected at the Bonifacio Global City was chosen over 19 other designs. His three-meter Ang Supremo with Bonifacio facing the sky, Inang Pilipinas at his back with a flag and a young Katipunero with a sharpened bamboo stake protecting him, remains his most famous work. The Builders was commissioned by the Baguio Centennial Commission in 2009. It depicted the Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, and Americans who built Kennon Road and the city as they try to pry a huge boulder. It was unveiled at the Baguio Botanical Garden during the 100th anniversary of Baguio in September 2009. His other major works are the Risen Christ (1996) in front of the Transfiguration Chapel in Nasugbu, Batangas, with the Redeemer escaping from his death robe and leaping to Heaven. This is symbolic because Ben-Hur was named after a fictional character of an 1880 novel by Lew Wallace, which was later made into a popular movie in 1959 with Charlton Heston in the lead. Ben-Hur was a Jewish prince who was enslaved by the Romans and became a charioteer. He later met Jesus and became a Christian. Despite his artwork dotting the archipelago, Ben-hur remained rooted in his Arko ni Apo. He became in his later years, more of a teacher to young sculptors and a civic gadfly. He was outspoken about the rampaging overdevelopment and deteriorating culture of Baguio.  At a rally, with Ben-Hur on the right, son Bumbo and granddaughter Baba. Photo courtesy of Bumbo Villanueva “Napakaraming magagandang kuwento ang tatay namin tungkol sa ganda ng buhay at kung gaano tayo kamahal ng ating Lumikha (Our father had so many great stories about the beauty of life and how much our maker loves us),” Bumbo said. “Laging zero ang paycheck sa tuwing darating ang suweldo dahil sa dami namin ay ubos ang kanyang kinita sa bale pa lang. Isang araw namomoblema siya na wala na kaming pagkain hanggang sa may humabol sa amin sa gate at sabi, “Lakay, may isang kabang bigas ka.” (Always zero paycheck even before payday because there were so many of us. One day while having problems on where to get food, someone reached to us at the gate and told us, Lakay, I have a cavan of rice for you),"" he added. “Napakabait ng tatay ko at maraming tao ang kanyang nabahagian ng kanyang napakagandang loob. Sana makilala niyo rin siya ng ganito (My father is very kind and there were a lot of people to whom he shared this kindness),” Bumbo said. “He was always a teacher,” said Kigao Rosimo, one of the few sculptors in the city whose medium is not wood. “The knowledge he has shared will forever be cherished.” Last Saturday, Kigao went to Arko ni Apo to invite Ben-hur and son to join the art exhibit he’s curating and found no one in the ark. At that time, Ben-hur was back in San Mateo surrounded by his wife Lolit and his family. His last words, according to daughter Bedette, were filmic: “Magpapahinga lang ako, Santo Kristo.” He was 81. – Rappler.com "

Residents and local leaders ask the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to temporarily ban the arrival of cruise ships in Subic. All photos from Randy Datu/Rappler ZAMBALES, Philippines – The Subic tour of cruise ship MV World Dream was canceled due to intense pressure from residents and local leaders for the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) to temporarily stop accepting cruise ships amid the novel coronavirus scare. The cruise ship from China arrived in Manila on Tuesday, January 28, and its 778 passengers were ""authorized to travel"" by the Bureau of Quarantine. Scheduled to arrive in Subic on Wednesday, January 29, the ship instead decided to cancel its arrival and head back to Hong Kong. In a January 28 letter, Olongapo Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr urged SBMA Chairman and Administrator Wilma Eisma to ""temporarily stop accepting cruise ships until the (novel coronavirus) threat has been controlled."" He cited the ""uncertainty and lack of information"" on the novel coronavirus, the virus that originated from Wuhan, China, and has so far killed at least 106 and sickened thousands across China and several other countries. Paulino also noted that ""infected persons do not manifest any of its symptoms until much later."" He said temporarily stopping cruise ships from docking in Subic ""would not be unprecedented considering that various cities worldwide have implemented lockdowns in response to this disease."" 'Loss of income' The night before, Eisma issued a statement that said, ""I have personally discussed the Subic situation with Health Secretary Francisco Duque today and confirmed to him that safety protocols are in place at the Port of Subic."" ""He advised that there is not a need just yet to stop the entry of cruise ships in Subic in view of established safety measures in the Freeport,"" she added. The SBMA initially highlighted the supposed loss of income that could occur if the arrival of cruise ships was rejected, but this only angered residents even more. ""As an emerging cruise ship destination in Southeast Asia, Subic expects to be adversely affected by this ongoing health emergency,"" Eisma earlier said. Eisma was also in the habit of asking SBMA employees to physically welcome passengers of cruise ships at the dock upon their arrival, but none were willing this time. A rumor even circulated that SBMA tourism employees would not report for work if the cruise ship was allowed to dock. On Tuesday, as the uproar from residents and Subic workers grew, Paulino pleaded with Eisma to ""please err on the side of caution and put primacy in the health and safety of the residents and workers of SBFZ (Subic Bay Freeport Zone) and the city and municipalities surrounding it."" Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun also sent a letter to Eisma, saying ""let us join hands to be more cautious, giving priority to the health and safety of the people in our locality.""  'ERR ON SIDE OF CAUTION.' Olongapo City Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr joins the rally. Photo from Randy Datu/Rappler Backlash It was also reported that tourism establishments in the Subic Freeport were pushing behind the scenes and working with the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce to temporarily suspend the arrival of cruise ships. Robert Gonzaga, president and CEO of Subic Bay Marine Exploratorium Inc (SBMEI), said in a statement: ""The SBMA has issued guidelines on how to deal with this, but they should do more to address the core issue of a temporary ban on cruise ship visits. For our part, we will refuse access to our park to cruise ship visitors if they do not comply with SBMA guidelines, and our [government's] health and safety policies."" SBMEI is the corporate owner and operator of Ocean Adventure, Adventure Beach Waterpark, and Camayan Beach Resort and Hotel – top attractions in the Freeport. Gonzaga said that more important considerations should be prioritized over short-term income. ""We have put in place several measures to protect our guests, as well as our employees, from any health risk associated with the coronavirus. We want to reassure the public that safety comes first, last, and always for SBMEI,"" he added. The backlash to Eisma's stance on the issue culminated in a rally in front of the main gate of the Subic Freeport, where about 200 residents and Freeport workers brandished signs that read: ""No to cruise ships in the meantime,"" ""Konting malasakit naman SBMA,"" and ""Mas mahalaga ba ang kita kesa sa kaligtasan ng mamamayan ng Olongapo?"" While the rally was ongoing, cheers went up as news broke that the MV World Dream has decided to cancel its visit to Subic. For her part, Eisma immediately took to Facebook and posted a statement saying, in part, that the cruise visit ""has been canceled by Genting Cruise Lines, the operator of the cruise liner, in face of the circumstances on the ground."" She said that the Subic Bay Freeport community can ""breathe a sigh of relief in the outcome that, we hope, is acceptable and satisfactory to all."" Despite this announcement, however, the SBMA is still silent on whether or not a temporary ban on cruise ships is already in place in the Subic Bay Freeport. Among the groups that exerted pressure on the SBMA were Batang Gapo People's Organization Incorporated, Olongapo City local government units, Aeta leaders, all 17 barangay captains, and other people's organizations. ""Why would we put ourselves in harm's way if we can prevent it? If in their own country, they have already implemented a lockdown, why can't we do the same here?""

World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 28, 2020. Photo by Naohiko Hatta/AFP WUHAN, China – President Xi Jinping said Tuesday, January 28, China was in a struggle against a ""demon"" epidemic, as the death toll from the new SARS-like virus soared to 106 and the first cases of human-to-human contagion were detected abroad. Xi made his remarks during talks with head of the World Health Organization in Beijing as a host of nations prepared to airlift their citizens from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. ""Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection,"" Xi told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. ""The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,"" the Chinese leader said, pledging that the government would be transparent and release information on the virus in a ""timely"" manner. His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials in central Hubei province, where the disease first emerged in December. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this virus compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003. But others say local cadres had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month. Since then, the number of cases has soared – doubling to more than 4,500 in the past 24 hours. WHO chief Tedros praised China's response to the crisis during a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to state news agency Xinhua. Contagion abroad The WHO last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions. But global concern has been growing, with Japan and Germany on Tuesday reporting the first human-to-human infections outside China. Until now, all cases in more than a dozen countries involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. In Japan, a man in his 60s contracted the virus apparently after driving two groups of tourists from the city earlier in January, the health ministry said. He was hospitalized with flu-like symptoms on Saturday, January 25. On the other side of the world, a 33-year-old German man caught the disease off a Chinese colleague from Shanghai who visited Germany last week, according to health officials. The development came after countries including Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Philippines announced tighter visa restrictions for people coming from China. Experts believe the virus came from a wild animal market in Wuhan and then jumped to humans, with Chinese health officials saying Tuesday that people infect each other through sneezing or coughing, and possibly through contact. Authorities initially sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province late last week, trapping more than 50 million people. China then halted international and domestic group tours. It also imposed a wide range of travel restrictions inside China, suspending long-distance bus routes and more than 2,000 train services. But with the death toll climbing and more fatalities reported in Chinese cities far away from Wuhan, authorities on Tuesday urged people to delay any foreign travel ""to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people,"" the National Immigration Administration said. Escape plans Wuhan, meanwhile, has been turned into a near ghost-town under a lockdown that has largely confined the industrial hub's 11 million people to their homes. With a ban on car traffic, the streets were nearly deserted apart from the occasional ambulance – although the city's hospitals are overwhelmed. ""Everyone goes out wearing masks and they are worried about the infection,"" said David, a Chinese man who works in Shanghai but ended up trapped in Wuhan after it was put under quarantine. Many thousands of foreigners are also among those stuck in the city. ""It's deeply stressful,"" Joseph Pacey, a 31-year-old Briton who teaches English in Wuhan, told Agence France-Presse. ""The biggest fear for me is that this thing will go on for months, and it will get harder and harder to get supplies, and to live."" Japan said it would send a chartered flight on Tuesday evening to get about a third of its 650 nationals there. ""We will also bring aid supplies such as masks and protective suits for Chinese people as well as for Japanese nationals,"" Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in Tokyo. If the mission succeeds, Japan would be the first country to airlift its citizens out of Wuhan. A US-chartered flight bound for California is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Wednesday, January 29, with consular staff and some American citizens, a day later than previously planned. France and South Korea are also planning to fly out their citizens later this week, and several other countries, including Germany, were considering doing the same. The United States, Turkey and Germany have urged their citizens to ""reconsider"" all travel to China. Landlocked Mongolia – which is heavily dependent on trade with China – took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbor to cars, as well as shutting down schools and banning large gatherings. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Boy Ryan Zabal/Rappler AKLAN, Philippines – Eleven Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – tracked down in a resort on Boracay Island are under medical observation by the Provincial Health Office (PHO) of Aklan for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus. Four of them were in close contact with an infected coronavirus patient in Hong Kong, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon Jr said on Tuesday, January 28. The 11 Chinese nationals from Hubei province were supposed to spend a one-month vacation in Boracay when Hong Kong authorities alerted the Philippine health officials to conduct intensive contact-tracing. Hubei has been on lockdown, limiting the movements of some 60 million people, since the new coronavirus broke out in its capital city of Wuhan last December. The tourists traveled from Hong Kong to Kalibo via Manila on January 22. Seven other Chinese people were traced by health authorities in close contacts with the 4 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island. It was not immediately known if the 4 Chinese who were in close contact with a confirmed case in Hong Kong were the family who landed in Manila on January 22 via Cebu Pacific, and which the Bureau of Immigration was supposed to have already tracked. The patients were transported to Kalibo town on Friday evening, January 24, for medical observation. They are staying in hotel rooms at the government-run Governor Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center in Old Buswang, Kalibo Old Buswang, Kalibo for the next 14 days. Cuachon emphasized there is still no confirmed cases of 2019-nCov in the province of Aklan and in the Philippines. ""They had no flu-like symptoms, no cough or fever. They are made to stay at the training center because they might be at risk of hospital acquired-pneumonia if we admitted them. The 4 Chinese tourists had close contacts with one confirmed coronavirus patient in Hong Kong. The 7 other Chinese who are with these 4 in Boracay are also under medical observation,"" Cuachon said in a mix of English and Filipino. “We are monitoring them every day. After the 14-day incubation period, they will be allowed to go back to China, with the help of the Chinese embassy, and will have to cut short their vacation in Boracay,” Cuachon added. 3 earlier patients discharged Meanwhile, the 3 patients were discharged from isolation rooms at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo were discharged by attending doctors on January 28. A 6-year-old boy initially admitted in the Dr. Ciriaco H. Tirol Hospital in Boracay Island was referred to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 23 for exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Cuachon said the child, who had a history of travel to Wuhan in Hubei province, yielded negative results on coronavirus infection, based on tests conducted by the Philippines Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). “He had influenza, not novel coronavirus,” Cuachon said. Sample specimens were also taken from two female siblings, aged 8 and 6, from Shanghai, China, who had been admitted to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 26. These were sent to RITM for confirmatory tests. In efforts to keep coronavirus from spreading, PHO-Aklan is coordinating with the Department of Health and the Bureau of Quarantine in monitoring the arrival of passengers in ports and airports in the province. Cuachon urged the public to avoid contact with farm and wild animals, going to crowded places, and contact with sick individuals. On Saturday, January 25, Aklan health authorities sent back to Wuhan 80 Boracay-bound tourists. They were part of the group which left the epicenter city a few hours before it was locked down by Chinese authorities. Since December 2019, the Wuhan coronavirus has been reported in China, France, Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Nepal, Germany, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, United States, and Sri Lanka. The World Health Organization said the common symptoms of novel coronavirus include cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, and fever. – Rappler.com   "

A Palestinian boy sits on a chair with a national flag as Israeli authorities demolish a school site in the village of Yatta, south of the West Bank city of Hebron and to be relocated in another area, on July 11 2018. File Photo by Hazem Bader/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – President Donald Trump on Tuesday, January 28 unveiled his long-awaited plan for the Middle East that staunchly backs Israel but offers the Palestinians a pathway to a limited state. Here are some of the major points of Trump's plan, which he presented at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and which the Palestinian leadership quickly criticized. Israel annexiation, Palestinian state Trump's plan will give around 30% of the occupied West Bank to Israel, which will have full sovereignty over the strategic Jordan Valley. Hours after the US green light, Netanyahu signaled he would ask his cabinet to approve Israel's annexation of parts of the West Bank including Jewish settlements. But the plan said Israel would freeze for 4 years its settlement-building in areas designated for a potential state of Palestine, giving the Palestinian leadership a window to accept the proposal. Contrary to some predictions, Trump's plan allows for an independent state of Palestine, if it is demilitarized and the leadership recognizes Israel as a Jewish state. The plan rejects any dealings with Hamas, the Islamist militant organization that runs Gaza, and says Israel will not implement any deal unless the Palestinian Authority ""or another body acceptable to Israel"" has full control of the impoverished territory. (READ: ISIS vows 'new phase' of attacks focused on Israel – audio message) Two capitals in Jerusalem? Trump, who defied international consensus in 2017 by recognizing hotly disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital, said that the holy city would remain ""undivided"" as capital of the Jewish state. The plan acknowledged the Palestinians' desire for a capital in ""eastern Jerusalem"" and said it could be established in areas including Abu Dis, a Palestinian village adjacent to Jerusalem that is physically separated by an Israeli barrier. The White House said Jerusalem should be recognized as Israel's capital – most countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv – and suggested that the Palestinian capital be known internationally by Jerusalem's Arabic name Al Quds. The proposal does not change the status of the Islamic, Christian or Jewish holy sites in the city. Developing Palestinian state The White House promises that a future Palestinian state would be developed with bridges, roads, and tunnels, including a high-speed corridor that links the West Bank and Gaza over Israeli territory, and enjoy a free-trade agreement with the United States. The Palestinians would also enjoy access to two Israeli ports, although Israel would retain control of the waters. Trump's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner already unveiled an economic component of the plan in June in Bahrain, with promises of $50 billion of investment in the Palestinian territories and its neighbors. The Palestinians boycotted the presentation, calling it a way to buy off their political aspirations. No right of return for refugees The plan would end any hope of returning to what is now Israel by millions of Palestinians or their descendants who fled or were forced out when the Jewish state was created in 1948. The plan would integrate some Palestinian refugees, the number subject to Israel's agreement, in the future Palestinian state. Others would stay in Jordan or other neighboring countries where they have long lived or be settled around the Islamic world. The United States would back a fund to compensate refugees, while the UN body for Palestinian refugees, to which the Trump administration has stopped contributing, would wind down. Arab support The United States and Israel hailed support for the plan by Gulf Arab states, which do not recognize the Jewish state but are united in concerns about Iran. The United Arab Emirates praised the plan as an ""important starting point"" for peace talks and, along with Bahrain and Oman, sent its ambassador to the announcement. But Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab countries to have made peace with Israel, were not present, and Jordan said an independent Palestinian state had to be based on borders before the 1967 Six-Day War. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Noel Celis/AFP SYDNEY, Australia – Scientists in Australia have successfully replicated the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, in what they said would be a ""game changer"" in the fight against a deadly epidemic which has stricken thousands. The Doherty Institute in Melbourne announced Wednesday, January 29 that it had grown the novel coronavirus in cell culture from a patient sample, the first time the virus has been replicated outside China. ""Having the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities,"" virus identification laboratory head Julian Druce said. ""It will be a game changer for diagnosis."" China was quick to sequence the genome of the coronavirus and make it public, allowing scientists around the world to develop diagnostic tools and winning praise for its efforts, in contrast to the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. However, China has not shared the virus itself with laboratories worldwide – which the Australian lab will now do via the World Health Organization (WHO) – though the WHO announced Tuesday, January 28 that Beijing had agreed to allow a team of international experts into the country to work with their Chinese counterparts. Doherty Institute deputy director Mike Catton said the new finding meant scientists could now create an antibody test that would allow the coronavirus to be detected in patients who had not displayed any symptoms. ""An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,"" he said. ""It will also assist in the assessment of effectiveness of trial vaccines."" Governments, universities, and medical corporations worldwide are racing to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus, a process that could take months. The virus, which is believed to have originated in a wild-animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 4,500 people in China and killed more than 100. More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan, in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to more than 15 countries. – Rappler.com "

A private school in Manila suspends classes and takes precautionary measures on January 28, 2020, amid the novel coronavirus emergency. Photos by Inoue Jaena/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Asian nations were ramping up defenses against a deadly viral epidemic Tuesday, January 28, sealing borders, shuttering public places, and clamping down on visitors from China. Concern over the steadily expanding contagion, which has killed over 100 in China and sickened more than 4,500, is prompting an increasingly urgent push for protection. Hong Kong, which has 8 reported cases of the SARS-like disease, announced the sealing of 6 of its 14 border crossings to the mainland from Thursday, January 29. The government in the semi-autonomous Chinese city of 7 million had faced criticism for merely barring people from the outbreak's ground-zero, central Hubei province. ""The epidemic has spread to many Chinese provinces. Only blocking visitors from Hubei can't do much to help Hong Kong,"" lawmaker Helena Wong said. Singapore, with 7 confirmed cases of the virus, has announced it will ban visitors who have traveled to Hubei as well as those with passports issued in that Chinese province. Government official Lawrence Wong said the travel restrictions were not taken lightly and will be expanded if necessary. Officials said efforts are also underway to track down an estimated 2,000 people already in Singapore with a Hubei travel history for potenital quarantine. Mongolia has taken a much more drastic line, closing its entire border with China to pedestrians and cars as well as ordering schools to close. It has no reported cases. In Russia's Far-Eastern district, which shares some 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) of frontier with China, crossings that should have re-opened after Chinese New Year will stay closed for days or weeks. Corralling the disease has become an effort at containing people's movements, and both Malaysia and the Philippines have taken steps to squelch the flow of Chinese visitors. Manila has been issuing visas on arrival since 2017 to Chinese nationals, adding fuel to the boom in mainland visitors to the Philippines. That policy is now suspended, though Chinese can still apply for a visa at a consulate or embassy in their home nation. 'Avoid people gathering' ""We are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry (of the virus),"" said Jaime Morente, immigration commissioner in the Philippines, which has no confirmed cases. Thailand announced that all passengers flying in from Chinese airports are undergoing screening, as the number of confirmed infections hit 14 on Tuesday, January 27, the highest outside of China. The outbreak is sending shock waves through Asia's tourism industry, which has become increasingly reliant on growing numbers of Chinese visitors. The measures come amid a boom in Chinese foreign travel, with the number of tourists from the country increasing nearly tenfold since 2003, according to a report by research firm Capital Economics. China has already imposed wide-ranging travel restrictions across the country and halted international tours, but on Tuesday called for all overseas travel to be postponed. Authorities have also cracked down on public places where the disease could spread, with Mongolia barring events like conferences or sporting competitions. From Wednesday, Hong Kong public facilities ranging from pools and sports centers to museums will all be closed.

Kobe Bryant's remains have been indentified via fingerprint. Photo by Adam Davis/EPA-EFE  LOS ANGELES, USA (UPDATED) – Medical examiners identified the body of NBA legend Kobe Bryant after recovering the remains of all 9 people who died in a helicopter crash near Los Angeles, officials said Tuesday, January 28 (Wednesday, January 29, Philippine time). Bryant's body was officially identified along with 3 others using fingerprints, two days after their helicopter crashed into a rugged hillside northwest of the city. Meanwhile federal investigators finished their inspection of the crash site, handing it over to local authorities. ""We are done on the site,"" said Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. Images showed investigators earlier flying drones over the accident site and manually combing through twisted, charred wreckage of the helicopter, which was scattered over a wide area of 600 feet (180 meters). Officials also used drones to replicate the helicopter's final, fateful flight path, Homendy said. Earlier Tuesday, the coroner's office confirmed all 9 bodies have been retrieved from the site and ""transported to the department's forensic science center"" for examination. (READ: All 9 bodies recovered from Kobe Bryant helicopter crash site) The bodies of pilot Ara Zobayan, baseball coach John Altobelli and Sarah Chester have also been identified. The remaining 5 – including Bryant's 13-year-old daughter Gianna – have not yet been officially identified. The death of Bryant – a five-time NBA champion for the LA Lakers and double Olympic gold medalist –has shocked the world, with tributes continuing to pour in Tuesday. 'High energy impact crash' Bryant, 41, was traveling with daughter Gianna and 7 other passengers and crew when the Sikorsky S-76 slammed into a hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of LA. The helicopter was headed to Bryant's Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, where his daughter was set to play. Homendy described the accident as a ""high energy impact crash,"" having earlier labeled the crash scene as ""pretty devastating."" Homendy said the helicopter did not have a ""terrain awareness and warning system"" installed. The NTSB in 2004 had recommended to federal aviation authorities that the system be required on all helicopters with 6 or more passenger seats, but the recommendation was not adopted, she added. Investigators have now airlifted the helicopter's wreckage onto trucks, which then transported it to a secure location for further examination. An iPad, cellphone and maintenance records were found among the wreckage, along with ""everything we would expect would be on the aircraft,"" said Homendy. She told journalists that the probable cause for the accident may not be confirmed for 12 to 18 months, when a final report will be issued. A preliminary, fact-based report is expected in 10 days. 'Heartbroken and devastated' The other passengers on the flight – who have not yet been officially identified – have been named as Altobelli's wife Keri, and their daughter Alyssa, who played basketball at the same club as Gianna. Christina Mauser, an assistant coach of the Mamba girls' basketball team, was also killed along with Payton Chester, Sarah's daughter. Mourning fans Tuesday placed bouquets of flowers at a makeshift memorial outside the gated community in Newport Beach, south of Los Angeles, where the late NBA great lived. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said a tribute to Bryant would be included in next month's Oscars ceremony telecast. The star, who won an Academy Award in 2018 for animated short film Dear Basketball, had been honored with a moment's silence at the Oscars nominees luncheon on Monday. A petition for the NBA logo to be redesigned with Bryant's likeness had reached two million signatures by Tuesday afternoon. The NBA postponed Tuesday's Lakers game against the Los Angeles Clippers. Basketball superstar LeBron James said he was ""heartbroken and devastated"" over Bryant's death in an emotional Instagram post, while also vowing to continue his friend's championship legacy with the Lakers. Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic donned a tracksuit bearing Bryant's initials and shirt numbers at the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne. With the crash site becoming a pilgrimage point for fans, police on horseback and all-terrain vehicles have been brought in to secure the area. – Rappler.com "

""We are very clear we are an optimistic, outward-looking, free-trading nation and we will look for friendly cooperation with the European Union based on a free trade agreement,"" he said. He thanked Britain's partners for their friendship over the years, but added: ""We're looking forward to a very different world and a very different relationship."" Some of the minister's colleagues, however, were skeptical, warning that Britain would find itself exposed in trade talks with Washington and with the EU, far larger trading economies. France's minister for Europe, Amelie de Montchalin, was pessimistic for Johnson's ambition to forge new deals. ""We lose a partner, we lose a member, and I also feel the the UK will lose a lot of support in a lot of negotiations the UK has announced would be launched in the coming weeks,"" she said.

Photo by Said Khatib/AFP PARIS, France – US President Donald Trump's Middle East plan on Tuesday, January 28 prompted a lukewarm response from Europe and the UN, and a furious rebuke from key Muslim countries who denounced it as betrayal of the Palestinians. Here are some of the reactions from around to the world to the plan, which had already been resoundingly rejected by Palestinian leaders before Trump launched it alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Palestinian Authority Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, who has taken part in previous US-led peace talks with Israel but stayed away Trump's proposal, vowed that ""this conspiracy deal will not pass."" He pledged to ""resist the deal in all its forms"" after meeting with various Palestinian factions in the West Bank city of Ramallah. ""Our people will take it to the dustbin of history."" Europe Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said the bloc will ""study and assess"" Trump's proposals on the basis of its commitment to a ""negotiated and viable two-state solution that takes into account the legitimate aspirations of both the Palestinians and the Israelis."" Germany, the EU's most powerful player, echoed Borrell's point by calling for a balanced approach. ""Only a negotiated two-state solution, acceptable to both sides, can lead to a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. Britain, which is leaving the EU on Friday, January 31 and has long had a special relationship with Washington, gave the warmest reaction. ""This is clearly a serious proposal, reflecting extensive time and effort,"" British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Trump to discuss the plans. Downing Street said the proposal ""could prove a positive step forwards."" The UN The United Nations said it remains committed to a two-state solution based on the borders in place before the 1967 war, when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza. ""The position of the United Nations on the two-state solution has been defined, throughout the years, by relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions by which the Secretariat is bound,"" said Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Russia Russia said it would study the plan and called on Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate directly to find a ""mutually acceptable compromise."" Introducing a note of doubt, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said: ""We do not know if the American proposal is mutually acceptable or not. We must wait for the reaction of the parties."" Turkey Turkey, a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause, condemned the plan. ""The United States' so-called peace plan is stillborn,"" Turkey's foreign ministry said in a statement. ""This is an annexation plan aimed at killing a two-state solution and extorting the Palestinian territory."" Iran Iran, which does not recognize Israel and has been in a confrontation with the Trump administration, denounced the plan as a threat to regional stability. ""The shameful peace plan imposed by America on the Palestinians is the treason of the century and doomed to fail"", the Iranian foreign ministry said. Hezbollah Lebanon's Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah, which Washington calls a terrorist group, said the plan represented an attempt to ""wipe out the Palestinian people's rights"", adding that the ""shameful move... could not have been made without the complicity and betrayal of a certain number of Arab regimes."" UAE The United Arab Emirates, which sent its ambassador to Trump's announcement alongside Netanyahu despite not recognizing the Jewish state, praised the plan. ""The plan announced today offers an important starting point for a return to negotiations within a US-led international framework,"" the UAE embassy in Washington said on Twitter. Egypt Egypt called on ""the two concerned parties to undertake a careful and thorough examination of the US vision to achieve peace and open channels of dialogue.""

The suspects told police that they were victims of a highway robbery incident, and that the thieves got all the goods they were transporting – 4,500 cases of Emperador brandy worth P4.5 million. “It was dawn of January 27 when the suspects reported at the Lopez municipal police station alleging that they were victims of a highway robbery incident. However, authorities noted glaring inconsistencies in their statements,” Malapascua said. Further investigation revealed that the suspects were not robbed but instead conspired to sell the stolen products. Malapascua added that CCTV footage in the area contradicted the suspects' robbery claim. All this prompted the 5 suspects to reveal that they were instructed by Jon Jon de la Torre, a subcontractor for the liquor delivery, to transfer the shipment to unauthorized vehicles and stage a robbery incident.

Metro Manila police chief Major General Debold Sinas will lead his ranks in losing weight over the next few months to comply with an order from the top brass. File photo by Angie de Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) is launching a program to get its obese cops in shape, and leading the effort is its chief, Police Major General Debold Sinas, who admitted he is obese, too. “Actually, ako ‘yung tinarget nilang gawing model eh (Actually, I was the one they targeted to be the model),” Sinas jested when he discussed with reporters on Tuesday, January 28, the Philippine National Police’s (PNP) overall directive for its members to get fit. Beginning Tuesday, February 4, all Metro Manila cops who fall under obese classes 2 and 3 based on their body mass index (BMI) will be required to attend a lecture on how to lose weight and start an exercise regimen, Sinas said. A person’s BMI is their weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. It can be an indicator of high body fatness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Class 1 “low-risk” obese are people whose BMI is 30.0 to 34.9. Class 2 “moderate-risk” obese are people whose BMI is 35.0 to 39.9. Class 3 “high-risk” obese are people whose BMI are 40.0 or higher. Cops who will be required to participate in the weight loss program are to report at least twice a month for two months to monitor and register their progress. Those who fail to significantly reduce their BMI by the end of March will be subjected to a “summer camp” to be set up in the NCRPO headquarters’ parade grounds. There, the cops’ diet will be controlled, and they will be required to exercise throughout the day. Sponsoring the cops’ diet would be inexpensive anyway, Sinas said, because it will all be vegetables. “Lettuce pa more (More and more lettuce),” he quipped, eliciting laughter from the reporters. Sinas said he himself had already started a fitness program, which the PNP Health Service is monitoring. The goal for the members of the service is not so much to achieve a certain weight but to cut a leaner figure. “At least bring it down to obese class 1,” Sinas added. The NCRPO is looking at some 700 of its cops who are either obese class 2 or 3. The PNP has long been criticized for having overweight cops among its ranks. Earlier in January, PNP chief Police General Archie Gamboa said cops who do not meet the proper weight requirement will be barred from promotions.

""The Syrian army has retaken most neighbourhoods in Maaret al-Numan"" and are now combing recaptured areas, said state news agency SANA, shortly after Damascus loyalists entered the town in the northwest province of Idlib for the first time in 8 years. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that most rebels and jihadists had pulled out after regime forces stormed the town from multiple fronts earlier in the day. (READ: Syria regime must halt 'escalation of violence' – EU) It said regime forces were left battling the few fighters that remained holed-up in the area, which has been under opposition control since 2012. Maaret al-Numan, which is nearly deserted after months of bombardment, lies on the M5 highway linking Damascus to Syria's second city Aleppo, a main artery coveted by the regime as it tries to rekindle a moribund economy. It is also the second biggest urban center in the beleaguered opposition bastion of Idlib. Its recapture would bring the regime a step closer to taking full control of the wider jihadist-run bastion and the M5 highway that runs through it. Damascus loyalists have since Friday seized more than 25 towns and villages around Maaret al-Numan, the Observatory said. The regime's advance is part of a multi-pronged push in northwest Syria, dominated by jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham alliance and their rebel allies. The violence has displaced around 358,000 people in Syria's northwest since December, the United Nations says. Exodus In areas north of Maaret al-Numan, bombardment by regime ally Russia has prompted a fresh wave of displacement in recent days, with hundreds of vehicles packing a key exit route towards areas near the border with Turkey, according to the Observatory and AFP correspondents. Most were fleeing the town of Saraqib and the Jabal al-Zawiya region, both located north of Maaret al-Numan. Russia has bombed areas around the main exit routes, despite the heavy outflow of civilians, according to the Observatory. Misty Buswell of the International Rescue Committee warned that the latest escalation ""will only add to the humanitarian catastrophe that is already unfolding."" The escalation has also sparked concern from rebel-supporter Turkey which operates 12 observation posts in Idlib under a September 2018 deal with Russia that aimed to prevent an onslaught in the province. Turkey warned Tuesday, Janury 28 it will retaliate ""in self-defense"" if any of its army posts are threatened, while accusing the regime of ""massacring innocent civilians and causing a humanitarian tragedy."" The Observatory says regime troops have encircled a Turkish observation post south of Maarat al-Numan as part as their push towards the town. It is the third such post encircled by regime forces in the region. 'Town of the revolution' The Idlib region is home to 3 million people, half of whom have already been displaced from other parts of the country. Maaret al-Numan was one of the first in that region to rise up against the government of President Bashar al-Assad in 2011, its residents say. Dubbed ""the town of the revolution,"" it became a hub for demonstrations in the southern part of Idlib, attracting followers from villages all around. Rebels overran the town in October 2012, attracting deadly regime air strikes on the town but without dousing the revolutionary fervor. The latest push to retake Maarat al-Numan coincides with battles between regime forces and jihadists in the west of Aleppo province, a rebel-held area that in mid-January became the latest front of fighting in northwest Syria. The battles there are the most intense since regime forces forced rebels out of large swaths of the province in 2016. Regime forces, which currently control around 70% of Syria, have repeatedly vowed to recapture the entire country, including Idlib and its environs. Syria's war has killed more than 380,000 people and displaced more than half the country's population since starting in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. – Rappler.com "

The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) earlier suspended direct flights from Wuhan City, China, the epicenter of the virus. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Immigration (BI) announced on Tuesday, January 28, the temporary suspension of the visa upon arrival (VUA) mechanism for Chinese tourists and businessmen. While the BI takes care of VUA issuances in the Philippines, the Department of Foreign Affairs takes care of the issuance of Philippine visas in foreign countries. The BI had also earlier clarified that there is no policy to bar Chinese nationals in general, so those who have other valid visas can still enter the Philippines. The latest in the Philippines: Health authorities have not yet recorded any confirmed case of the coronavirus in the country. But as of January 28, the health department announced that it was monitoring 24 people with symptoms of respiratory illness, and who all have a history of travel to Wuhan. Other measures taken: The DFA said it was ready to repatriate Filipinos in Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province who want to come home, though this would be subject to China’s rules on disease containment, immigration clearance, and quarantine process. Upon arrival in the Philippines, the DFA said Filipino repatriates will undergo 14 days of mandatory quarantine per guidelines of the Department of Health. DFA Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said about 50 Filipinos expressed the desire to come home as of Wednesday, January 29, but that details were still being ""coordinated and considered.""

""I want to stress that we cannot give a guarantee that this operation is able to succeed and I also want to stress very clearly that we may not be in a position if we're able to do this on one occasion to do it on another occasion,"" he said. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia was seeking permission from Chinese authorities to allow its citizens to depart Wuhan, with Australian consular officials travelling from Shanghai to coordinate the efforts. Japan and the United States have already evacuated hundreds of citizens from Wuhan. The virus, which is believed to have originated in a market trading in wild animals in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected nearly 6,000 people in China and killed more than 130. More than 50 million people have been locked down in and around Wuhan in a bid by authorities to stop an infection that has since spread to more than 15 countries. Five people in Australia have been treated for the virus and are said to be in a stable condition.

Chicks sit in a pen during the 33rd International Livestock Trade Fair in Bruz, a suburb of Rennes, western France, on September 10, 2019. (Photo by Sebastien Salom-Gomis/AFP PARIS, France – France said Tuesday, January 28 it will ban the controversial but widespread practices of live-shredding day-old male chicks and castrating piglets without anesthesia, in a move cautiously welcomed by animal welfare activists. Some 7 billion male chicks, unwanted as they provide neither meat nor eggs, are culled around the world every year – many ground up alive, others gassed, electrocuted, or asphyxiated in plastic bags. France will be one of the first countries to ban the mass culling of chicks using any of these methods, starting next year. ""From the end of 2021, nothing will be like it was before,"" Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume told reporters in Paris as he announced the measure long demanded by campaigners, though many said he had not gone far enough. (READ: Vegans and animal advocates to stage protest against animal oppression) Guillaume said he hoped a method would be found soon that would allow farmers to determine the gender of a chicken embryo in the egg before it hatches. Researchers have been working on devising a viable method for years, but to date, the science requires individual eggs to be pierced for samples to analyze the hormones they contain – a technique that is not economically viable on an industrial scale. Making them fatter Switzerland already banned chick shredding in September last year, even though it was a rare practice among Swiss poultry farmers. Germany, where some 45 million male chicks are macerated each year, outlawed it too, but a top administrative court ruled in June that the slaughter could continue until a method is found to determine the sex of an embryo in the egg. France and Germany announced last November they would work together to put an end to the chick massacre. An EU directive from 2009 authorizes shredding as long as it causes ""immediate"" death for chicks less than 72 hours old. Also from next year, Guillaume announced, France would require anesthesia be given to piglets being castrated. Neutering is done to encourage slaughter animals to grow fatter and prevent a potent smell said to emit from the fatty meat of non-neutered boars. Castrating piglets is less common in Europe outside France, according to the US-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and the use of anesthesia is already obligatory in some countries. France prides itself on its meat and poultry industries, but there have been growing tensions in recent years between producers and activists calling for radical changes in farming methods. (READ: Spaniards probed for 'killing' 72 piglets by jumping on them) 'Not ambitious' A series of French butcher shops have been vandalized by activists who say eating meat is an immoral violation of the rights of other species. Anissa Putois of PETA told AFP on Tuesday the new measures ""are a step in the right direction, but still inadequate. ""These practices and many other forms of mutilation, unnatural confinement, and violent slaughter are still happening in the meat and animal products industries around the world."" The CIWF animal lobbying group said the real aim should be to stop the castration of piglets altogether, and expressed disappointment that Guillaume did not announce a ban on eggs from cage-raised chickens. For its part, the L214 group which opposes all meat consumption, said the measures were ""not ambitious"" and ""do not address the basic problems."" ""There is nothing on slaughter conditions, nor on how to exit from intensive animal farming,"" it lamented. For Putois, ""the best alternative to these cruel and barbaric practices is to make the transition to a vegan diet which does not expose sentient beings to suffering."" Guillaume said agriculture ministers meeting in Brussels Monday, February 3 decided to put in place a responsible husbandry labelling system on all European animal-based products, starting next year. An opinion poll in January found that three-quarters of French people did not believe the government was doing enough for animal protection. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Angie se Silva/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Ombudsman Samuel Martires has fired and indicted for direct bribery and graft the 3 Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) officials who were accused of extorting P50,000 from a Bilibid inmate in exchange for his early release in what is known as the Good Conduct Time Allowance (GCTA) for sale scheme. Martires dismissed from public office former BuCor documentations chief Ramoncito Roque, as well as Maria Belinda Bansil and Veronica Buño, on top of an indictment for direct bribery and graft. ""This Office finds probable cause to indict the respondents for one count of direct bribery under Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) and one count of Violation of Section 3(e) of R.A 3019,"" said the resolution approved by Martires on Tuesday, January 28, and released to the media Wednesday morning, on January 29. The charges against the 3 will be filed before the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court (RTC), according to the resolution. The 3 officials were perpetually disqualified from holding public office. Their retirement benefits were forfeited, while their civil service eligibility was canceled. ""In the event that the penalty of dismissal can no longer be enforced due to respondents' separation from the service, the same shall be converted into a fine in the amount equivalent to their respective last salaries for 1 year, payable to the Office of the Ombudsman,"" said a separate decision on their dismissal, also approved by Martires on Tuesday. GCTA for sale During the Senate hearing on the GCTA issue last year, whistleblower Yolanda Camilon accused Roque, Bansil and Buño of extorting P50,000 in exchange for the early release of her husband, the Bilibid inmate, based on the GCTA. Camilon detailed her correspondence and meetings with Bansil and Buño, including the exchange of initial payments. Roque, as documentations chief, would be the one to call the final shots, as alleged by Camilon. The 3 had denied the allegations. Roque claimed Camilon and Bansil left an envelope containing money in his house without his knowledge. Referring to this claim, the Ombudsman said, That Roque ""never reported the said incident to the authorities"" means the claim ""cannot be given full faith and credit."" ""The foregoing narration of facts by Camilon proves that respondents conspired with each other to commit the crime of direct bribery against Camilon,"" the Ombudsman said. The 3 will also be charged of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, which punishes a public official who acts with ""manifest partiality, evident bad faith, and gross inexcusable negligence"" and which caused ""undue injury"" to the government. ""Said respondents, conspiring together, acted with evident bad faith, or at the very least, gross inexcusable negligence, when they repeatedly promised several dates for the release of Camilon's husband in exchange for P50,000,"" said the Ombudsman. The GCTA for sale scandal led to the suspension of many more higher-ups in the BuCor, including its legal chief, and prompted an overhaul of the bureau beginning with the appointment of its current chief, Director General Gerald Bantag. The Office of the Ombudsman earlier confirmed that its investigation also covered former BuCor chiefs Nicanor Faeldon and Senator Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa. GCTA law The GCTA law's internal rules have been revised to exclude from the benefits all inmates convicted of heinous crimes. As a consequence, thousands of heinous crime convicts previously released were hauled back to a Bilibid underprepared for the volume of returnees. At least 5 returnees have died since. A petition challenging the constitutionality of the new internal rules is pending before the Supreme Court. Several petitions for the writ of habeas corpus demanding the release of some returnees are also pending in different courts. – Rappler.com  "

The arrest of Charles Lieber, the chairman of Harvard's chemistry and chemical biology department, is the latest development in a long-running saga over suspected intellectual property theft. US sleuths are investigating hundreds of cases of alleged theft by Chinese scientists working in or visiting the United States.

The other is a cancer researcher who is accused of trying to smuggle vials containing biological research out of the US in his socks. Lieber's arrest is unusual because he is not of Chinese descent and is a prominent figure at one of the world's most respected universities.

""We've been working on this for a while because we had to rebuild some of our systems to make this possible.""

""As of today, our Off-Facebook Activity tool is available to people on Facebook around the world,"" Zuckerberg said in a blog post.

Now you can see a summary of that information and clear it from your account if you want to,"" Zuckerberg said. Facebook gets data from users' activity online and also from apps such as Airbnb, Uber and Fandango. The new tool is part of an effort by Facebook to shore up its image in the wake of a series of privacy scandals, including the hijacking of personal data on millions of users by a British consultancy developing voter profiles for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. ""One of our main goals for the next decade is to build much stronger privacy protections for everyone on Facebook,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Over the next few weeks we'll show nearly two billion people around the world a prompt encouraging them to review their privacy settings."" Facebook readies 'supreme court' Separately, Facebook said its ""supreme court,"" designed to be the final word in content removal disputes, should be in operation in a few months, as it named a British human rights activist to a key post. The social network said that former Article 19 executive director Thomas Hughes would be the staff director of the oversight board, which is being developed to settle questions on what content is removed from Facebook or Instagram. Hughes told reporters he sees the new post as ""aligned to what I've been doing for the last couple of decades,"" on protecting human rights and freedom of expression. The plan for an oversight board was proposed by Zuckerberg in 2018, to make difficult calls on what is appropriate content for Facebook. The company initially planned to bring it into operation by the end of 2019. The move is billed as part of an effort by Facebook to balance freedom of speech with concerns over manipulation of the social network for abuse or deception, particularly heading into the US presidential election this year. – Rappler.com "

Lifting shares Shares in Apple jumped 2% in after-market trades that followed release of the fiscal first-quarter earnings, extending a remarkable streak for the company which a year ago had been dogged by concerns of a slowdown in smartphone sales. Apple shares have doubled from a year ago – lifting its valuation to more than $1.3 trillion – as the company has expanded its services with a streaming television offering, digital payments and wearable tech such as its AirPods and updated Apple Watch. Analyst Yoram Wurmser of the research firm eMarketer welcomed ""a strong quarter for Apple, primarily driven by strong sales of the iPhone 11 lineup."" Apple bought back $20 billion in shares during the quarter and paid some $3.5 billion in dividends as part of a stated mission to be ""net cash neutral"" some time in the future, Maestri said. Apple has stopped reporting unit sales for the iPhone, which has been the main cash-generator for the company in recent years, but sales revenue for its smartphone sales was up nearly eight percent in the quarter at $55.9 billion. Services revenue rose 17 percent from a year ago to $12.7 billion, driven by the launch of its Apple TV+ service and its new credit card. The Apple TV+ on-demand streaming service launched in more than 100 countries at $4.99 per month, at a price lower than those offered by rivals such as Netflix. For the category of wearables and home accessories -- including its HomePod speaker, Apple Watch and other gadgets -- revenue increased some 37 percent to $10 billion.

Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama (center) waves to the crowd during the third day of a series of teachings in Bodhgaya on January 4, 2020. STR/AFP WASHINGTON DC, USA – The US House of Representatives on Tuesday, January 28,  voted to authorize sanctions against Chinese officials who interfere in the process of determining the Dalai Lama's successor, raising pressure as the Tibetan spiritual leader approaches 85. Under the legislation, Washington would freeze any US assets and ban travel to the United States of Chinese officials found to be involved in ""identifying or installing"" a government-approved Dalai Lama A total of 392 lawmakers voted for the bill with 22, all of them Republicans plus one conservative independent, opposed. The act still needs approval from the Senate, where Republican Marco Rubio has promised to lead efforts, before heading to President Donald Trump for his signature. The law would also prohibit China from opening any further consulates in the United States until Washington can open a mission in Lhasa, the Himalayan territory's tightly restricted capital. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime advocate for Tibet, said that the bill aims to encourage Beijing to resume dialogue with envoys of the Dalai Lama that broke off a decade ago. ""We are supporting the Tibetan people's right to religious freedom and genuine autonomy by formally establishing a US policy that the Tibetan Buddhist community has the exclusive right to choose its religious leaders, including the 15th Dalai Lama,"" Pelosi said. It is the latest human rights bill passed in the US Congress, including an act in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters that angered China. The 14th Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, has won a global following through his good-humored discourses on peace and compassion, helping fuel interest in his push for greater Tibetan autonomy. Beijing, while officially atheist, has signaled that it could try to stage-manage his succession – a ritualistic search in which monks look for clues in a young boy – with the presumed goal of grooming a pliant Dalai Lama. While brushing aside any worries about his health, the Dalai Lama has said he is open to breaking tradition by choosing a successor before he dies, including potentially a girl, or even declaring the institution finished with him. In 1995, Beijing selected its own Panchen Lama – another influential Tibetan Buddhist position – and detained a six-year-old identified for the role, whom rights groups described as the world's youngest political prisoner. – Rappler.com  "

How can the victim have access to the perpetrator’s database, hard drive, memory, or cloud? Must they demand it from the voyeur?    “I’m just turning off the alarms, babe,” he assured me when I spotted him holding his phone. I was on top of him, naked. I kept going, but then I heard the beep of a video being recorded. “STOP AND DELETE THAT VIDEO,” I told him. “No, it’s okay. Just keep going,” he replied, continuing to film me. I got off him. He then showed me that his camera roll and Deleted Files folder were now empty, but I still couldn’t respond. He slowly pushed me down the bed, kissing my neck, apologizing. At the same time, he was putting me back in a position where I could let him in and finish. Which he did, quite quickly. After washing up, I could feel myself losing my grip, so I left the bedroom and went into a fit of hyperventilation and crying on my couch. When he finally came out, I asked him, “How many women have you done this to?” He denied having done it before. He said it was his uncontrollable libido that made him do it. He knew my trauma from a similar experience, but my outright refusal to be filmed at that moment did not alarm him. (READ: [OPINION] Addressing privacy concerns to prevent sexual abuse) On our first date, I was given a warning by a frequent customer of the bar to not go home with him because he films girls and shows the stuff to his friends. I went on dating him anyway, sticking to the principle of assuming someone’s innocence until proven otherwise. As I gathered more intel after my own possible scandal, names of more girls came up, and the chilling truth could not have been more apparent: here was a person who got off on sharing his voyeuristic exploits with his fraternity – and getting away with it – and I let him into my home. (READ: Violence against women: Sex, power, abuse) But this is not the jarring part of the story. When you’re building a relationship, appearing in court to defend your honor is not something you prepare for. You think of the restaurants and beaches you’d bring him to; you think of the fights and the strategies you'd undertake for handling each other. No one thinks of keeping any sort of verbal or written exchanges to present to court. (READ: Cebu cops nab criminology student for threatening to post girl's nude pics) This is also true when the relationship crashes and burns and you have to pick yourself up from the wreckage. You think instead of Friday nights with your friends, when you can get blackout drunk. You think of the apps you can swipe through for a rebound. So when I drove down to the police station to finally file a report, I was unarmed. They demanded a video. They demanded evidence of the distribution of the video. In law school, you would see this as due process, but as a woman who anticipated becoming part of Philippine jurisprudence, I couldn't help but wonder how dumb the men were who wrote this law. In the anti-voyeurism law, the mere act of recording without consent is already punishable (Section 4a, RA 9995), and spreading it and keeping it are different offenses – yet all require the presence of the video from the victim.

Snatch their phones to see group chats of strangers feasting on their bodies? The law is a soft shell, not a shield. I can’t imagine what kind of woman it can protect. One whose video is already out and viewed by the hundreds of thousands? Someone whose life could have been kept normal, but only if she had top tech assistance to hack her perpetrator's devices? This isn’t the kind of breakup or end to dating that anyone imagines. Yet, as unimaginable as mine was, the fact that this man-child victimized many women and is still scot-free and swiping through dating apps shows the inadequacy of the law – an inadequacy based on recklessness, a product that lacked a woman’s input. I write this wanting to be the last victim, which was why I had contacted his family to make him seek psychological help, and had later filed a blotter.

759,250483,"January 29, 2020",Philippines,GMA to Supreme Court: Talents not regular but independent contractors,Sofia Tomacruz,"Taking its case to the High Court, broadcast giant GMA Network also argues 
that the broadcast industry is peculiar and not covered by basic labor rules  HIGH COURT. GMA Network takes its battle against 101 workers it calls 'talents' to the Supreme Court. Rappler file photo MANILA, Philippines – After losing their case at the Court of Appeals (CA), GMA Network and its chief executive officer Felipe L. Gozon filed a case with the Supreme Court seeking to reverse the appellate court's decision declaring over 100 of its workers as regular employees. In a case filed at the High Court on Monday, January 20, and shared with media on Wednesday, January 29, GMA argued it was exempt ""to a certain extent"" from the ""basic precepts of labor and employment"" as the broadcast industry was peculiar and unique. ""Wherefore, premises considered, it is prayed of this Honorable Court that the assailed decision promulgated on November 25, 2019 of the Honorable Court of Appeals be reversed and set aside and that the complaint for regularization filed by respondents against herein petitioners be dismissed...and respondents declared as not regular employees but independent contractors,"" GMA Network said. Last November, the CA junked the motion for reconsideration filed by GMA and Gozon and upheld an earlier decision declaring 101 media workers of GMA Network as regular employees. The CA said the petitioners did not present any new argument for the court to deliberate thus it found ""no compelling reason"" that warranted a modification ""much less a reversal of the assailed decision"" dated February 20, 2019. What GMA wants. The broadcast giant argued the CA ""gravely erred"" when it affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) decisions in 2015 and 2016, which declared and affirmed that the workers were regular employees. GMA said the appellate court ""mis-appreciated"" ""facts"" on the employment of 101 media workers when it ""failed to consider...the history and peculiarity of the broadcast industry."" In requesting the SC overturn the CA's decision, the broadcast network accused the workers of pushing a ""classic case of person who wants to have their cake and eat it too."" The network said that were the SC to declare workers regular employees, such ""would not really be to champion the causes of labor"" but would instead ""derail"" management rights and interests and ""affect the balance and practice of the broadcast industry."" In applying the 4-way test in Article 280 of the Labor Code, GMA insisted it did not hire the respondents as its employees, did not pay their wages, did not have the power to dismiss ""but may terminate"" talent agreements pursuant to violations, and did not have control over workers' conduct. Workers speak up. The 101 workers who have since organized themselves as the Talents Association of GMA or TAG, have long debunked GMA's claims. Using the 4-way test cited in the Labor Code, the talents said, proved they were regular employees. The 4-way test quashes the power of any written agreement if a worker passes it. First, TAG said workers applied for jobs, took examinations and employment tests and were later interviewed then hired following hiring processed for a regular job. TAG also said workers maintained regular office hours and did not report to GMA offices ""once a week"" for ""just a few hours"" as the network claimed. ""The network is describing the process for outsourced production houses and it is a barefaced lie. We report to the office everyday, on the call time set by our respective programs, and stay for the duration of the production period until our program ends air,"" they said in a statement on Wednesday. Second, TAG said workers were paid every 10th and 25th of the month, every month, similar to how GMA paid its regular employees, who received their wages every 15th and 30th of the month. Third, TAG asserted GMA had the power to dismiss workers when 11 of the 101 workers were terminated due to breach of agreement, which the Labor Code provides among just causes on termination. Fourth, TAG said workers answered to Executive Producers of News programs who were regular employees and thus represented the network. GMA, they said, would also issue memorandums when workers committed errors and were made to sign consent forms which indicated they read ethics and editorial manuals given to them. Why this matters. The network called the workers “talents” whose contracts were continually renewed over a period, some as long as 10 years. TAG members said they have fought to be declared regular workers to not only push for their rights but for better labor conditions in the media industry. ""In describing the hundred of talent-petitioners who have dedicated years of their lives to the network, GMA Network said 'this is a classic case of a person who wants to have his cake and eat it too.' We will not stand idly by while the network reduces our fight for better labor treatment to a mere metaphor,"" the group said. TAG said it welcomed the opportunity to present to the SC not only its case but also the ""hard realities that also reflect the realities of many talents like us, in the media industry and outside."" – Rappler.com "

Phivolcs conducts a drone survey of Taal Volcano on January 27, 2020. Screenshot from Phivolcs video MANILA, Philippines – Taal Volcano on Wednesday, January 29, stayed at Alert Level 3, which was declared 3 days ago when it started to show a ""decreased tendency towards hazardous eruption."" The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in its 8 am bulletin on Wednesday that it observed ""moderate to voluminous emission of white to dirty white steam-laden plumes 600 to 800 meters tall"" from the main crater during the past 24 hours. The tallest plumes stated in Phivolcs' bulletin a day ago, on Tuesday, January 28, were also 800 meters tall. Meanwhile, the sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission was measured at an average of 64 tons per day, in contrast to Tuesday's, when the level of SO2 was too low to be detected by instruments. But Phivolcs confirmed to Rappler in a phone interview that 64 tons remains a low level of SO2. SO2 emission previously averaged as high as thousands of tons per day, when Taal had been under Alert Level 4. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. More SO2 is released when magma is near the surface of a volcano. As for volcanic earthquakes, the Philippine Seismic Network plotted only 3 volcanic earthquakes from 5 am on Tuesday to 5 am on Wednesday. These were magnitudes 1.7 to 2.1, with one felt event at Intensity III. Since 1 pm of January 12 – when the Taal unrest began – to present, the Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 760 volcanic earthquakes. Of these, 177 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. The Taal Volcano Network, which can record small earthquakes undetectable by the Philippine Seismic Network, recorded 123 volcanic earthquakes in the past 24 hours. These included 3 low-frequency events, which are ""caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface,"" according to the United States Geological Survey. ""These earthquakes signify magmatic activity beneath the Taal edifice that could lead to eruptive activity at the main crater,"" Phivolcs said, reiterating that while the chances of a hazardous eruption may have decreased, the unrest has not totally stopped. The following could still happen, which would threaten Taal Volcano Island and lakeshore areas in the province of Batangas: Taal Volcano Island; the barangays of Bilibinwang, Subic Ilaya, and Banyaga in Agoncillo; and the barangays of Gulod, Buso-Buso, and Bugaan East in Laurel remain on lockdown. These areas are within a 7-kilometer radius from the main crater, which is Phivolcs' recommended danger zone while Taal is under Alert Level 3. (WATCH: Police uphold duty to others, even while affected by Taal Volcano's eruption) If volcanic activity continues to ease, Taal could be further downgraded to Alert Level 2. But if it escalates, Alert Level 4 may be raised again. The highest possible status is Alert Level 5. It would mean that a hazardous eruption is already in progress. – Rappler.com "

About 3.6 million Chinese transited through the emirate's main airport in 2019. Dubai International Airport in 2018 served over 89 million passengers, including more foreign passengers than any other airport worldwide for the fifth year in a row. The UAE's Abu Dhabi International Airport, another major hub, has also begun screening passengers arriving from China. Between them, the two Emirati hubs operate dozens of flights a week with Chinese cities. China is the UAE's top trading partner and Abu Dhabi is among the 15 top crude oil suppliers to Beijing. Several hundred Chinese companies have offices in the UAE. The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Like SARS, it can be passed among humans via the respiratory tract.

765,250489,"January 30, 2020",IMHO,"[OPINION] Dear Duterte Legacy, more roads will not decongest EDSA",Jayson Edward San Juan,"'Almost all urban planning literature debunks the idea that expanding road space for vehicles eases up congestion'    For the past several weeks, several government officials have been harping on the supposed achievements of President Rodrigo Duterte. Bannered as the “Duterte Legacy,” the media blitz names policies and programs allegedly spearheaded and accomplished by the incumbent administration since taking office in 2016. Included in this contested list are several infrastructure projects under the government’s “Build Build Build” (BBB) program. (READ: Making sense of the ‘Duterte Legacy’ infographic) In their media visits and various releases, Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar and BBB Executive Director Anna Mae Lamentillo claim that the 23 projects under the BBB program costing around P383 billion will decongest EDSA, 6 of which will be completed this year: NLEX-Harbor Link Segment 10, NLEX-Harbor Link R-10 exit ramp, Mindanao Avenue Extension Segment 2C, Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, Fort Bonifacio-Nichols Road (Lawton Avenue) Widening, and the Bonifacio Global City-Ortigas Center Link Road Project. The claim of EDSA decongestion through these new roads – the “EDSA Decongestion Plan” – is a populist claim. It strikes a raw nerve among commuters who suffer two to 3 hours of heavy congestion daily along the capital region’s main road. Induced demand Writing in 1955, American urban planner and philosopher Lewis Mumford ushered in a concept which, in a nutshell, goes, “Building more roads to prevent congestion is like a fat man loosening his belt to prevent obesity.” Almost all urban planning literature debunks the idea that expanding road space for vehicles eases up congestion. And yet, it remains a popular but flawed reasoning used by government to sell the idea of building more roads. At first blush, the idea that more roads mean lesser congestion seems logical: more lanes create more capacity for cars to pass through faster. But this logic assumes that the supply of vehicles remains constant, never growing. The fat man’s loosened belt, an image as used by Mumford, demonstrates the concept of “induced demand,” or the idea that increasing road capacity for vehicles encourages more people to drive, thus increasing road congestion. The general logic behind this is that the provision of new road space, virtually free of charge, creates an incentive or stimulus for people to drive more and fill up the new space. Complicating the matter are the Filipinos’ deep-seated longing for more mobility through car ownership – as articulated in the country’s long-term vision paper Ambisyon Natin 2040 – and the falling prices of automobiles, which will combine to raise latent demand, portending a flood of new vehicles once new roads open, congesting these new spaces again quickly. (READ: [ANALYSIS] What Duterte doesn’t get about Metro Manila traffic) At first, new and wider roads will create an impression of faster travel times. But latent and induced demand may encourage a change in behaviour among road users: buying more cars and switching from trains and buses to private cars for greater personal comfort. These choices will increase the number of vehicles using the new and wider roads, bringing the new roads back to their self-limiting equilibrium, and back to congestion. Aside from this, road constructions and expansion will induce the creation of new settlements and mixed-use areas, or the further densification of existing ones, along these new roads. As urbanization responds to available infrastructure, road capacity expansion will attract more road users, specifically private vehicles. This induced demand, with vehicular traffic acting as gas that expands to fill up all available spaces, rather than as liquid that flows through a certain volume of space, is undesirable. It is a concealed ingredient to the government’s recipe for disaster. Designing transportation for accessibility, not speed Many of us are obsessed with the idea of speed and faster mobility, manifested by our penchant to “decongest” our roads. We look at EDSA and we demand to “decongest” it by banning provincial buses, and “disciplining” city buses. We demand faster movement for our automobiles by closing down intersections and building more pedestrian overpasses, and by destroying sidewalks to expand the carriageway. This national obsession to “decongest” traffic flow illustrates our autocentric culture where the private automobile is king, while pedestrians and commuters are second-class road users. It manifests our own socio-economic order: the more affluent members of society must be able to move faster and more efficiently, while the rest of us are stuck in “traffic.” Primarily catering to privately owned automobiles, these BBB projects packaged as the “EDSA Decongestion Plan” are bound to fail because they are designed for speed, not accessibility. They are either elevated and tolled, or located in fast-moving highways – both of which excludes the provision for pedestrian sidewalks and protected bicycle lanes. Without the latter two amenities serving as alternative transportation modes, induced demand will catch up and re-congest these roads at some point. A true decongestion plan does not seek the elimination of barriers to speed (i.e., wide sidewalks, protected bicycle lanes, loading zones, and traffic-calming devices) to accommodate automobiles; it promotes accessibility for all users, regardless of whether one walks, bikes, drives, or rides the bus. – Rappler.com Jayson Edward San Juan is a licensed urban planner and an advocate of people-centered urban design, with a focus on inclusive mobility and the role of institutions in transportation.

Photo by Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP MANILA, Philippines – At least 48 fact-checking organizations worldwide are collaborating to debunk false information shared online about the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Rappler is taking part in the initiative. The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) launched the collaborative project on Friday, January 24. So far, the 3 biggest trends of misinformation and disinformation that have spread online are: ""The collaborative project, coordinated by the IFCN, will be active for as long as the disease spreads worldwide and can be followed on social media channels through two hashtags, #CoronaVirusFacts and #DatosCoronaVirus,"" IFCN associate director Cristina Tardáguila wrote in her article published on Poynter on Tuesday, January 28. IFCN said the ""first big wave of misinformation"" was about a patent of the virus created a few years ago. Among the organizations that fact checked this were US-based Lead Stories, Fact-Check.org, and PolitiFact. Following this, the Taiwan Fact-Check Center then debunked several posts about ways to protect people from the virus, as well as methods to cure the ones who have contracted it. Since Taiwan is geographically close to China, this ""second wave of falsehoods"" became big there, IFCN said. The ""third wave of hoaxes"" was about the sources of the novel coronavirus. Although there are studies that suggest bats and snakes play a role in the outbreak, the origin hasn't been confirmed yet as of posting. ""In the next few days, an interesting subject should pop up: Will the anti-vaccination movement try to take any advantage out of this? Brazilian fact-checking unit Agência Lupa is keeping track of that,"" Tardáguila added. In the Philippines, Rappler has also debunked a number of false claims about the 2019-nCoV. So far, the false claims that circulated nationwide were mostly about ""confirmed cases"" of the 2019-nCoV in the country. There was also a claim that wrongly associated the novel coronavirus with rabies, which may cause confusion about the nature and classification of the new illness. The 2019-nCoV first emerged in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, a major transport hub in China that has a population of 11 million. Since it is a new strain of coronavirus, much is still unknown about it.

A spot report from Police Regional Office 10 said the attack of an ""unidentified armed group"" on the convoy of Police Brigadier General Joselito Salido, Deputy Director of the Philippine National Police Directorate of Integrated Police Operations-Eastern Mindanao, happened at 6:40 am on Wednesday in Barangay Tikalaan and Dominorog in Talakag.

Those wounded were: The wounded cops were initially brought to the Talakag Provincial Hospital and later moved to the Cagayan de Oro City Polymedic Plaza Hospital. Police said the highway leading to Barangay Tikalaan was placed on lockdown following the incident, and that there was a firefight in the area. Police Lieutenant Colonel Silvestre Asiong Jr, Bukidnon police spokesperson, said Bukidnon police chief Colonel Roel Lamiing ordered the augmentation of police  to secure the area. The 403rd Infantry Brigade of the 4th Infantry Division as well as the 1st Special Forces Battalion were sent as reinforcement to go after the attackers. Suspects Asiong also said Salido was on his way to Don Carlos town  to inspect and check the operational readiness of the 1st and 2nd Provincial Mobile Force Companies there. He said the convoy was supposed to go to Bukidnon via Barangay Puerto, Cagayan de Oro, but decided to divert to Talakag, to cut their travel time in going to Don Carlos. ""The dead and wounded were on board the lead car of Salido’s convoy,"" Asiong said. Asiong said the group behind the ambush had yet to be identified but police suspected the New People's Army, the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines.

Photo by Mark Ralston/AFP WUHAN, China – Hundreds of Americans and Japanese escaped the quarantined Chinese city at the center of a coronavirus epidemic aboard charter flights on Wednesday, January 29, as the death toll soared to 132 and confirmed infections neared 6,000. The scale of the deepening crisis was emphasized with the new infection number on the Chinese mainland exceeding that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-03. SARS, another respiratory coronavirus transmitted between people, went on to claim nearly 800 lives around the world, with most of those fatalities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The new disease has spread to more than 15 countries since it emerged out of Wuhan late last year, although all the confirmed fatalities have so far been in China. (READ: PH repatriating Filipinos in Wuhan, Hubei province who want to return home) Authorities last week imposed transport bans in and around Wuhan in an unprecedented quarantine effort, leaving more than 50 million people effectively trapped. ""We were not able to move freely, so we only had partial information,"" said Takeo Aoyama, a Nippon Steel worker who was among the Japanese nationals airlifted early Wednesday. ""The number of patients began increasing rapidly at a certain point. That was very worrying."" China has taken other extraordinary measures to try and stop the disease spreading, including bans on tour groups travelling overseas, suspending schools and extending the Lunar New Year holiday. With global concerns mounting, the United States, Britain and other countries have also advised their citizens against travelling to China. (READ: PH suspends visa issuance for travelers from Hubei over coronavirus scare) Escape Thousands of foreigners have been among those trapped in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town with car travel banned and residents staying indoors. Countries have for days been scrambling to try and get their citizens out of Wuhan safely, but have faced huge logistical, medical and bureaucratic hurdles. About 200 people were aboard the Japanese flight which landed in Tokyo on Wednesday morning. Medical professionals were on the plane to carry out checks but Japan's health ministry said there were no plans to quarantine the passengers. They would instead be asked to remain at home and avoid crowds at least until the results of the test were known. A US charter flight also left Wuhan on Wednesday with about 200 Americans on board, including employees from the local American consulate. The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea is due to do the same. Australia said it would evacuate citizens from Wuhan and quarantine them on an island normally used to detain asylum seekers. More deaths Meanwhile, the virus continued to spread and kill in China. Authorities said Wednesday the number of cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the virus of which Wuhan is the capital, soared by over 800 from the previous day. The number of confirmed cases across the country climbed to 5,974, while the death toll nationwide jumped 26 to 132. All of those new reported deaths were in Hubei except for one, in a province just to the north. The virus is believed to have originated in a wild-animal market in Wuhan, where it jumped to humans before spreading across the country as the peak travel period for Lunar New Year festivities got under way. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, January 28, branded the virus a ""demon"", as he held talks with World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO later said it would send urgently dispatch international experts to China ""to guide global response efforts"". ""Stopping the spread of this virus both in China and globally is WHO's highest priority,"" Tedros said. Until Tuesday, all reported cases in more than a dozen countries had involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. But Japan and Germany then reported the first confirmed human-to-human transmission of the illness outside China. Vietnam is investigating another case. Germany now has 4 confirmed cases, all of them employees at a Bavarian firm recently visited by a Chinese colleague, health officials said. Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about the new virus compared with its handling of the 2002-03 SARS epidemic. But others say local officials had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month. The US asked China on Tuesday to step up its cooperation with international health authorities over the epidemic. Washington has offered China assistance 3 times so far without success, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters. Separately, US health authorities said they were working on a vaccine, but that it would take months to develop. The virus has rattled global markets and threatens to dent an already-slowing Chinese economy. Apple was closely watching the outbreak in China, home to the firm's third-biggest consumer market and much of its supply chain, chief executive Tim Cook said in an earnings call. Global coffee chain Starbucks said it expected a significant earnings hit after closing more than half of its stores across China. US Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell is likely to be quizzed about the economic impact of the virus after the bank's monthly interest rate decision on Wednesday. – Rappler.com  "

770,250494,"January 29, 2020",Philippines,P2.85B shows for ‘minimal improvement’ in dairy program,Rappler.com,"Still, state auditors recommend that the program be continued to help meet the demand for locally-produced milk in the implementation of the National Feeding Program   MANILA, Philippines – A government program that cost P2.85 billion to implement appears to have achieved only ""minimal improvement"" in increasing the number of dairy animals in the Philippines, the Commission on Audit (COA) said. The Herd Build-Up Program (HBP), ran for 6 years, from 2012 to 2018. It started with 39,069 dairy animals but ended up with only 47,600 animals at the most recent count in 2018 and included cattle and carabaos. The program aimed to increase the local supply contribution for milk to 10% from a 2012 local supply figure of 1%. Some 99% of the milk in the Philippines is imported. The 111-page performance audit released by COA on January 23 showed that from 2013 to 2016, there was only a 0.2% uptick in the milk production, and a 0.3% uptick from 2017 to 2018. This amounts to the importation of 1.746 billion liters of the country's local requirement, while Filipino cattle and carabao raisers supplied only 23.69 million liters of milk. The National Dairy Authority (NDA) and the Philippine Carabao Center (PCC) produced less than 4 of every 5 liters of that figure.  The audit team reported, “Analysis of the local milk production in CY 2018 revealed that, of the 23.69 million liters total production for the industry translated to 1.3 percent local milk sufficiency, only 18.40 million liters could be accounted from the reports/data of the NDA and PCC."" The NDA brought in 15.25 million liters, while the PCC contributed 3.15 million liters. Reasons for failure COA's report outlined 5 reasons for the lackluster results of the program: State auditors noted that, due to underfunding, the NDA was able to import only 3,060 dairy animals out of the target 11,880 heads. Meanwhile, the PCC didn't even get to import dairy buffalos ""due to lack of funding support from the Department of Agriculture."" The deaths of the imported cattle also cost the government millions – some P346.35 million on the NDA side and P471.42 million on the PCC side – and effectively set back the program. Based on interviews with program officials and dairy farmers, COA reported that cattles died due to ""problems with herd management, inadequate provision of proper animal health care services, and non-provision of housing facilities for animals."" Still, COA recommended that the program be continued. It urged the NDA and PCC to work on implementing artificial insemination on the existing herds, as well as working on improving the buy-back program with their partner raisers to increase their inventory and better address the issue of cattle deaths. ""It is expected that the demand for locally-produced milk in the implementation of RA 11037 or the National Feeding Program will provide impetus to the government as well as the private sector for more investments aimed at increasing the number of dairy animals and volume of milk production,"" COA said. On Tuesday, January 28, Senator Cynthia Villar called out the PCC and the NDA for not ensuring that milk would be affordable to low-income families. She said lack of milk would explain why children perform poorly in school. “Ninety-nine percent [of milk] is all imported. If a child is poor, can he buy imported milk? No. This is why poor kids don’t drink milk. That’s why you’re partly to blame for the dumbness of children. Children are made to drink milk so that they would be smarter,” said Villar, who chairs the Senate committee on agriculture committee. – Rappler.com "

The ICC's Office of the Prosecutor is currently conducting a preliminary examination into the matter and is expected to make a recommendation by 2020. Climate of impunity Aside from targeting suspected drug personalities, AI noted an increase in the vilification and harassment of human rights defenders under Duterte.

It was an affirmation of Philippine and US obligations under the 1951 MDT, which is the two countries' commitment to defend each other in case of an external attack. The Benigno Aquino III-time EDCA, which provided for increased military presence of the US in the Philippines, operationalized the VFA. Pimentel also said that the hearing would also tackle the Philippines-Australia Status of Visiting Forces Agreement that the Senate ratified in 2012. Senate's role Pimentel said that the other senators who attended the meeting all pushed for a hearing on the matter. The senators included Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon and Senators Sherwin Gatchalian, Ronald dela Rosa, Richard Gordon, and Grace Poe. Pimentel said that it was high time to review the VFA, given that the Senate has legislative oversight on the agreement. In a statement on Wednesday, Drilon said that the Senate should assert its role in the termination of treaties. ""The principle of checks and balances, historical precedent and practice accepted as law in most jurisdictions, and the Constitution’s dictate for a shared treaty-making power require that a termination, withdrawal, abrogation or renunciation of a treaty or international agreement can only be done with the same authority that gave it effect – executive ratification with Senate concurrence,"" Drilon said. Drilon had filed Senate Resolution 305, calling the Senate to ""express its sense"" that treaty withdrawals shall only be valid upon the concurrence of the upper chamber. During the 17th Congress, at least 14 senators filed a resolution declaring that the Senate has a say in the termination of any treaty or international agreements. The resolution was filed in 2016, after Duterte declared his intention to scrap the VFA and withdraw from the International Criminal Court. The same justification – that there's no need for Senate concurrence – led to the actual withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC. After Dela Rosa's US visa was canceled, Duterte again threatened on January 23 to scrap the VFA and asked Washington to ""fix"" the senator's visa within a month. The following day, January 24, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said that he would ""start the process"" of terminating the VFA. But Duterte took a step back, as the Department of Justice announced that Malacañang ordered a ""preliminary impact assessment"" on the planned abrogation. – Rappler.com "

'They only rely on assumptions,' notes the chairman of the House committee on Metro Manila development.  WEEKLY REPORTS NEEDED. The House Committee on Metro Manila Development asks for weekly reports from the motorcycle taxi technical working group to gauge apprehensions. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – After weeks of failing to report data on the safety of motorcycle taxis, the overseeing technical working group (TWG) is now required to submit weekly data reports to the House committee on Metro Manila development. During the committee hearing on Wednesday, January 29, Quezon City 1st District Representative Anthony Crisologo made a motion to oblige the Department of Transportation (DOTr), through the TWG and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), to submit weekly reports to the committee. Crisologo said the reports should contain data on the apprehensions, compliances, and the number of vehicles and drivers of the 3 providers included in the motorcycle taxi pilot run, namely Angkas, JoyRide, and Move It. ""So that while a law is being crafted – I think there are house bills being crafted – we can actually move side by side, parallel. While the TWG is operating, we can also do our part and study the law, and so we can find out if there is really data,"" Crisologo said in a mix of English and Filipino. The motion was approved by the committee. ""The major shortcoming that we see is the data-gathering – there are no details. They only rely on assumptions, and the information they have comes from Angkas, the major player,"" said committee chair Manila 1st District Representative Manuel Lopez. Angkas claims to have a 99.997% safety record, but this is not verified by the MMDA, since the agency does not distinguish motorcycles if they are private or for public transportation when recording incidents. Lopez also wanted the Department of Information and Communications Technology to monitor the platform applications of the 3 players, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue to monitor if they are paying the right taxes. Why it matters: The pilot run was approved by the DOTr so that the viability of motorcycle taxis as a mode of public transportation could be assessed in aid of legislation. However, the TWG earlier terminated the pilot run prematurely, saying ""legal impediments"" – such as temporary restraining orders petitioned for by Angkas – prevented them from collecting data on the safety of motorcycle taxis. But a day after the Senate committee on public services urged them to reconsider the termination, the TWG reinstated the pilot run after making concessions with Angkas. The TWG has yet to present any data on the safety of motorcycle taxis, after the collective 7-month period of the pilot run. – Rappler.com "

The year 2020 will be a tipping point year for media companies. This is the year in which journalists must fight the battle for truth, according to Maria Ressa, CEO of Rappler, a digital news organization based in Manila, Philippines.“What we do this year – not just in the Philippines, but all around the world and especially in the United States – will determine whether or not the whole world walks into a cycle of fascism. We’ve been here before. What we do now matters.” Ressa – who has been the target of persecution in her country – offered these comments as part of a recorded statement presented to attendees of DCN Next: Summit at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Miami, Florida on January 15. In her statement, Ressa expressed gratitude to DCN CEO Jason Kint, the DCN Board of Directors, and the members of DCN for supporting her cause and helping her to “shine the light” through journalistic endeavors. “That really is the only weapon that journalists have,” noted Ressa. “What we’ve lived through in the Philippines…our dystopian present is your dystopian future. This is it, the battle for truth.” The DCN Board of Directors issued a statement – seen below – supporting House and Senate Resolutions calling on Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to end his political persecution of Ressa and Senator Leila de Lima. “Healthy democracies thrive with vigorous political discourse and a free, independent press,” noted the statement. On the question of whether there exists a line between journalism and activism, Ressa said that “in the battle of truth, journalism becomes activism. This is a hard-fought lesson we have learned in the Philippines.” Popular populist authoritarian-style leaders are getting elected throughout the world. “Just like they had a dictator’s playbook, they lie,” she said. “A lie told a million times becomes a fact. Without facts, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have trust. Without all three, democracy as we know it is dead.” Ressa referenced her own experience when in 2018, the Philippine government investigated Rappler in at least 11 cases. “In 2019, I was arrested…not once, but twice,” she said. “I posted bail eight times. Ressa – who in 2018 was named by Time magazine as one of several journalists honored as Persons of the Year – spoke of her experiences at the 2019 DCN Summit in Orlando, Florida – just before one of her arrests. She also made the 2019 TIME 100 List as one of the year’s most influential people. The relevance of her travails extends to journalists everywhere. Because, as she said, “the enabler for all of this is technology. And technology is in the hands of American social media companies.” “Facebook is our internet,” Ressa said. “Where Facebook goes, the Philippines goes. The weaponization of social media was followed by the weaponization of the law. This is what’s happened to the gatekeepers, right? And when the gatekeepers move from the journalists to technologists… lies spread faster than facts.” “We applaud Senators Edward Markey and Marco Rubio along with Senators Marsha Blackburn, Christopher Coons and Richard Durbin who introduced Senate Resolution 142. We also applaud Representative Jackie Speier along with Representatives Henry Johnson, Jamie Raskin, Brad Sherman and Lloyd Doggett who introduced House Resolution 233.

DOH Francisco Duque III says the Philippine government is still studying imposing a temporary travel ban against Chinese tourists. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government is not yet considering imposing a temporary travel ban on all tourists coming from mainland China amid the threat of the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCov. This was Health Secretary Francisco Duque III’s response on Wednesday, January 29, when asked by Deputy Speaker Loren Legarda during the House of Representatives’ question hour if they were considering a temporary ban on all Chinese tourists. “Certainly thats one of the possible options that we are looking at, but not at this very moment. The reason being, your honor, is we have to be very careful also of possible repercussions of doing this, in light of the fact that confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus are not limited to China,” Duque said. The Department of Health (DOH) chief argued it would be unfair if only Chinese tourists are barred from entering the Philippines, when cases of 2019-nCov have also been confirmed in other countries. “If we do this, then the concerned country – China in this case – might question why we’re not doing the same for all other countries that have reported cases of the new coronavirus. It’s very tricky… but we commit to take this into consideration,” Duque said. The Philippines has only temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from Hubei province in China, whose capital city of Wuhan is the origin of the novel coronavirus. As of Wednesday, China has a total of 5,974 confirmed cases of the 2019-nCov, which has killed at least 106 people there. Apart from China, other countries that have confirmed cases of 2019 nCov include France, Japan, Australia, United States, Canada, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and United Arab Emirates. More ‘prudent’ to temporarily ban Chinese Contrasting with the DOH chief, Legarda believes it would be more “prudent” for the Philippines to impose the temporary travel ban against mainlander Chinese. “We’re clearly incapable of handling [this] crisis. Wouldn’t it be prudent [for us] to be proactive and ban temporarily mainland tourists in any port, not only Wuhan?” asked the Antique congresswoman. “I just value too much the health of the Filipino people,” Legarda added. Senator Francis Pangilinan, who wants a temporary ban against Chinese tourists like Legarda, said a total of 1,626,309 mainlanders visited the Philippines from January to November 2019 alone. “The progressive spread of the coronavirus and the increasing number of deaths due to it should prompt Philippine health and immigration authorities to preemptively ban visitors from Wuhan, if not from the most affected provinces of China,” Pangilinan said in a separate statement. The Philippines still has no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, though 23 persons with flu-like symptoms are still under observation by the DOH. – Rappler.com "

And ways our environment had been destroyed by natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, typhoons, earthquakes, floods and what we can do from the perspective of faith,” Palma said. Palma said the conference was also heeding the Pope's call to do more to address climate change. Francis, who has been campaigning for the environment since he became pontiff in 2013, slammed UN climate leaders who met in Madrid last year for their weak response to the climate crisis.

Cebu will take center stage in the quincentennial celebrations as the place where Ferdinand Magellan first landed and brought the image of the Santo Niño to local chiefs Queen Juana and Rajah Humabon. They are believed to be the first Filipinos baptized  – an event commemorated every year by reenacting it during the Sinulog Festival.An estimated 3 million people participated in the annual Sinulog Festival.

Father Michael Murpy Sarsonas, chairperson of the Cebu Archdiocesan Commission for Climate Concerns, said that they hope the conference would help them come up with a bottom-up approach to national, local and church policy recommendations, community projects, among other actionable measures. He also said that after the conference, they plan to launch the Cebu Climate Emergency Center to address local environmental concerns.

Then focus on the recovery process day by day by day. It’s a long journey but if you focus on the mini milestones along the way you will find beauty in the struggle of doing simple things that prior to this injury were taken for granted. This will also mean that when you return you will have a new perspective. You will be so appreciative of being able to stand, walk, run that you will train harder than you ever have.

Photo by Lito Boras/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Two congressmen on Wednesday, January 28, criticized President Rodrigo Duterte’s threat to terminate the Philippines-US Visiting Forces Agreement, calling it a “knee-jerk” reaction that endangered national security. In a House committee on foreign relations hearing, Deputy Speaker Johnny Pimentel and Cagayan de Oro 2nd District Representative Rufus Rodriguez expressed alarm over Duterte’s plan to scrap the VFA after he was angered by the cancellation of Senator Ronald dela Rosa’s US visa. Both lawmakers warned of the “severe repercussions” of the Duterte government’s decision to terminate the agreement considering it was linked to other defense deals, US assistance to the Philippine military, and relief efforts during calamities, among others.

""The Philippine government did not raise a furor. We did not even defend these two very important former government officials. But here comes a senator whose visa was canceled and we are going to scrap a very important agreement. This will have very severe repercussions on our relationship with the US,” he said. Rodriguez, for one, noted that Duterte should reconsider his actions on the ground that terminating the VFA “will be inimical to the national interest and national security.” Careful review and response. Department of Foriegn Affairs (DFA) Assistant Secretary Maria Isleta, who heads the department’s office of American affairs, sought to assure lawmakers that the several agencies, including the Department of Justice, were assessing the impact of scrapping the VFA. Iselta said initial discussions on the matter have fleshed out 3 main issues that needed further consultation. These included the establishment of proper procedures to terminate the VFA, a review of the benefits and cost of the VFA, and an assessment on the impact on Philippine defense and the economy. Apart from this, Isleta added meetings were also being scheduled at the "" highest level"" to come up with a recommendation for the President. Meanwhile, Rodriguez aired concerns over the possibility that the US could withdraw from defense pacts like the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement and the overarching Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), where the Philippines and US agree to defend one another in case of an attack. (READ: Malacañang downplays possibility of U.S. terminating other military pacts) Isleta said that based on preliminary discussions, if the VFA is terminated, the ""MDT may remain valid but inoperative."" This is because the VFA gives substance to the MDT, which required joint exercises be held between the two countries' militaries to ensure they could work together when needed. Sound advice needed. Lawmakers appealed to DFA officials to provide sound recommendations to Duterte. ""I hope DFA officials, you are the soldiers there, please make the very good recommendation that it will not only affect one person but please, think of all the 100 million people of the Philippines that might be affected with this revocation of the VFA,"" Pimentel said.

In 2019, Metro Manila ranked 2nd in the world's worst traffic congestion. File photo by Joel Liporada/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – With its congestion level in 2019 totaling to a whopping 71%, Metro Manila ranked second out of 416 cities across 57 countries in urban congestion, according to the TomTom Traffic Index 2019. TomTom, an independent location technology specialist, released its Traffic Index for 2019 on Wednesday, January 29, and noted a global increase in congestion. While Metro Manila placed second to Bengaluru or Bangalore, India, the two cities had the same congestion level. Only 15 out of the 416 cities had a congestion level of 50% and above. The congestion level is equivalent to how much extra time a trip will take compared to the city's baseline uncongested conditions. TomTom calculated the baseline of each city by analyzing free-flow travel times of all vehicles across an entire road network, which is recorded 24/7 daily. Analyzing data covering over 306.4 million kilometers of roads in Metro Manila, TomTom determined a congestion level of 73% for highways and 70% for non-highways. This is not the first time the National Capital Region topped a ""world's worst traffic"" study. In 2018, the Asian Development Bank ranked Metro Manila as the most congested city in developing Asia. In 2017, the Boston Consulting Group found that the megapolis had the 3rd worst traffic in Southeast Asia. Rush hour in Metro Manila The TomTom report revealed Friday as the day of the week with the worst rush hour at 6-7 pm. It said traveling after 7 pm on Friday could save a motorist up to 5 hours per year for a 30-minute commute. The evening rush on Friday had an average congestion level of 128%. How much time is lost during rush hour? In the morning, a 30-minute trip takes an extra 29 minutes, while in the evening, an additional 38 minutes is spent. This meant for 230 working days in a year, 257 hours or 10 days and 17 hours was spent driving in rush hours.

Photo courtesy of Henri de Leon of DOST-STII MANILA, Philippines – A Filipino researcher, who is studying the converstion of sewage into fertilizer, won the 2019 Newton Prize Philippines (Newton Agham) on Tuesday, January 28. De La Salle University (DLSU) professor Michael Angelo Promentilla is the Philippine project leader of the team that seeks to convert wastewater into nutrient-rich fertilizer to improve farming. Promentilla teaches at DLSU's Department of Chemical Engineering. He also heads the Waste and Resource Management Unit of the Centre for Engineering and Sustainable Development Research. The idea behind the study “Water-Energy-Nutrient Nexus in the Cities of the Future” is that wastewater contains nitrogen and phosphorus, both nutrients necessary for fertilizers. These nutrients are currently mismanaged as wastewater, and discharged to bodies of water, causing pollution. The Philippines is currently importing phosphates for fertilizers. Recycling wastewater from sewers or septic tanks and recovering the nutrients from them could help minimize the importation in the future. In turn, this would reduce the cost in obtaining fertilizers for crops, and at the same time reduce the energy demand in producing these. Their project is set to receive about £200,000 (around P13.2 million) from the Newton Fund of the British government. “About half of it we will use to develop a system for farms. We have a sister school, De La Salle University Araneta, which has a farm in Bulacan…. The farm caters to less-privileged students, like farmers' children. We will try to use the grant first to support research in that area,” Promentilla told Rappler in a mix of English and Filipino. Promentilla said the farmers they got in touch with uses the services of Malabanan Siphoning to get rid of their wastewater. “Hopefully, we can mentor the researchers on the farm and find out whether we can change the mindset of the farmers around that area…. We told them, instead of getting Malabanan, you can probably save if we process [your wastewater] and turn it into fertilizer. And then they can use the fertilizer for their crops,” he said. This research bested 3 other finalists from the Philippines: Meanwhile, the project named “Tissue engineering of bronchi in health and sickness: assessing the effect of matrix stiffening on cellular changes in the airways,” led in the Philippines by Jopeth Ramis of the Technological Institute of the Philippines, will vie for the Chair’s Prize in London on February 12, 2020. He will compete against the Chair Prize nominees from China and Indonesia. The Newton Prize Philippines celebrates the UK-Philippines’ partnership in supporting British and Filipino researchers and institutions working together “to develop science and innovation solutions that promote the economic development and social welfare of the Philippines.” “The program not only delivers those great partnerships between British researchers and institutions and fantastic researchers in the Philippines, but it’s helping those find solutions for challenges every country face, and which, when we find answers we’ll deliver safer, sustainable future for all of us,” said British Ambassador Daniel Pruce. – Rappler.com  "

Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the European Union Sir Tim Barrow (L) delivers the instruments of ratification for Brexit, notifying the Council that the UK has fully ratified the Withdrawal Agreement, to European Council Secretary General Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen at the EU Council headquarters in Brussels on January 29, 2020. Photo by Yves Herman/Pool/AFP BRUSSELS, Belgium – Britain's departure from the European Union was set in law Wednesday, January 29, as London returned a signed treaty and MEPs prepared to vote to ratify the divorce. After half-of-century of sometimes awkward membership, the United Kingdom will leave the EU at midnight Brussels time on Friday, January 31. The day began with Britain's permanent representative – soon to be ambassador to the EU – Tim Barrow handing back the withdrawal agreement. This had already been signed by Brussels' top figures and had been sent to London for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to sign for the UK government. ""This step ensures that the UK has fulfilled its legal obligations regarding our exit from the EU,"" his office said. Leaving the church Then Nigel Farage, leader of Britain's Brexit Party and for two decades a thorn in Brussels' side in the European Parliament, addressed reporters. ""At 11:00pm UK time on January 31 will leave the European Union and we pass the point of no return,"" he declared at a triumphant news conference. Farage said he had loved playing the ""pantomime villain"" in the Strasbourg assembly, feeding opposition to Europe at home with theatrical YouTube clips. But he insisted on the seriousness of Brexit, comparing its significance to Henry VIII taking Britain out of the Catholic church in 1534. ""He took us out of the Church of Rome, and we are leaving the Treaty of Rome,"" he said, referring to the EU's 1957 founding document. Later in the day, Farage's colleagues in the European Parliament were to gather for a historic vote to incorporate the withdrawal agreement into EU law. This will be the last legislative act of the 73 remaining British MEPs, and will be followed by a ceremony of farewell. After Brexit the United Kingdom will become what the EU calls a ""third country,"" outside the union, but the political and economic drama will continue. Britain and Europe will continue to apply EU rules on trade and free movement of citizens until the end of the year while negotiating a free trade agreement. In the face of skepticism in EU capitals, Johnson insists he is optimistic that a comprehensive free trade deal can be reached before the next cliff-edge. But negotiations will be tough between Britain, the world's sixth biggest economy, and the EU, a 27-nation single market with a population of 450 million. Fishing rights; residency and working rights for citizens; tariff free trade; access to Europe for Britain's huge services sector: all will be on the table. ""Brexit is a loss for us all,"" European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said Tuesday, January 28. He said it was important for the EU ""to maintain our unity"" as Europe negotiates the future partnership with the UK. The British minister for Europe attending the meeting, Christopher Pincher, expressed optimism on what the talks would yield. ""We're looking forward to a very different world and a very different relationship,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. UK goes solo Farage will leave Brussels on Wednesday, but the other Brexit Party MEPs, will march out of the parliament on Friday morning with the Union Jack in hand. They will join their leader in London at a Brexit party, before the houses of parliament. EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday, January 27, warned ""it is absolutely clear that there will be negative consequences"" from Brexit. ""Whatever agreement we reach on our future relationship, Brexit will always be a matter of damage limitation,"" he said in Belfast. Johnson's government hopes more trade with the United States and Asian powers can help offset the costs of Brexit. But the British premier was facing difficult talks on Wednesday with President Donald Trump's secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Trump backed Brexit, but Washington opposed Johnson's decision to allow Chinese telecoms giant to work on Britain's 5G telecoms network despite security fears. – Rappler.com "

Israeli President Reuven Rivlin embraces German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier (L) after his speech during a parliamentary session in homage to Nazi victims at the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) on January 29, 2020 in Berlin. Photo by John MacDougall/AFP BERLIN, Germany – The ""evil spirits"" of racism and anti-Semitism are re-emerging, the presidents of Germany and Israel warned in Berlin on Wednesday, January 29, as they marked 75 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp. Speaking at a special parliamentary session in the Bundestag, Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Germans had a responsibility to never forget their Nazi past and to stop hatred from spreading. ""The evil spirits of the past are reappearing today under a new guise,"" he said. ""More still, they are presenting their ethno-nationalist, authoritarian thinking as a vision, as a better answer to the questions of our time."" Israeli President Reuven Rivlin echoed those concerns in his own speech, warning that the continent was being ""visited by ghosts from the past."" ""Ugly and extreme anti-Semitism is hovering over the whole of Europe,"" Rivlin told German lawmakers. Both men were speaking after attending high-profile anniversary events in Jerusalem and at Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland in recent days. The solemn occasions were dominated by fresh fears over the safety of Jews in Europe, more than 7 decades after the Nazis murdered over 6 million Jews during World War II. Sitting in the audience in Berlin were MPs from the far-right AfD party, whose leaders have openly railed against Germany's remembrance culture and its ongoing atonement for the atrocities committed under Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime. Leading AfD lawmaker Alexander Gauland in 2018 described the Nazi era as ""a speck of bird shit"" in German history. Quoting Holocaust survivor Primo Levi, Steinmeier warned: ""It happened, so it can happen again."" 'Very negative influence' Rivlin was only the second Israeli president to speak at the German parliament's annual remembrance event, after Shimon Peres in 2010. Peres used his speech at the time to issue an emotional plea for the world to bring the remaining perpetrators of Nazi crimes to justice. But faced with a dwindling number of people who lived through World War II, attention is shifting to making sure that the horrors of the Holocaust are not forgotten. On the eve of their Bundestag speeches, Rivlin and Steinmeier visited a centuries-old Jewish secondary school in the German capital. ""We have the fourth, fifth and sixth generation after the Holocaust and World War II,"" Rivlin told students. ""Now we have to find a way to let you, and to let your children know what happened, and prevent it from happening again."" Steinmeier urged young people to complement their history lessons with real-life ""experiences"" by travelling to Israel and visiting concentration camps like Auschwitz, where 1.1 million people were killed. The German president, who serves as a kind of a moral arbiter for the nation, also voiced concern about the ""very negative influence"" of social media. He said his speech at Israel's memorial event last Thursday, January 23, in which he urged Germans to confront their past, attracted an ""unbelievable"" amount of negative reactions on Facebook. 'Mass exit' of Jews? Alarm about anti-Jewish hatred has catapulted to the top of Germany's political agenda after a suspected neo-Nazi gunman tried to storm a synagogue filled with worshippers in the city of Halle in October. After failing to break down the door, he shot dead a female passer-by and a man at a kebab shop instead. According to government figures, Germany recorded 1,799 anti-Semitic offenses in 2018, up nearly 20% on the year before. Of those, 69 were classed as violent attacks. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas warned this week that nearly one in two Jews has considered leaving the country. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has already taken steps in recent months to tighten legislation on anti-Semitic crimes and punish online hate speech. Germans ""bear the responsibility of making everyone feel safe at home in Germany and in Europe,"" Merkel said recently. As a close diplomatic ally, Germany treads carefully when commenting on Israeli politics. But Berlin joined a lukewarm European response Tuesday, January 28, to the Middle East peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""Only a negotiated two-state solution, acceptable to both sides, can lead to a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians,"" Maas said. – Rappler.com "

802,250526,"January 29, 2020",Philippines,Duterte prohibits Cabinet members from traveling to U.S.,Sofia Tomacruz,"'Parang boycott,' says President Rodrigo Duterte  NO U.S. TRAVEL. President Rodrigo Duterte presides over the 45th Cabinet meeting at Malacañang Palace on January 6, 2020. Malacañang file photo MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 29, barred Cabinet members from traveling to the United States, his latest move after threatening to scrap the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). ""I will leave it siguro sa (perhaps to) foreign affairs, but I will not allow any Cabinet member to go there at this time. No Cabinet member should be allowed to go to the United States...indefinitely,"" Duterte told reporters in an ambush interview on the sidelines of the Department of Social Welfare and Development's founding anniversary. Duterte's order stemmed from his earlier threat to terminate the VFA, which came after the US government canceled the visa of Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa. Dela Rosa, who was Duterte's first Philippine National Police chief, is known as the architect behind the government's bloody anti-drug campaign. With no Cabinet-level official making trips to the US, Duterte said he would ""limit"" the Philippines' interaction in ""whatever aspect of international relations would be discussed or subject to talks."" ""Parang boycott (It's like a boycott),"" Duterte said. Reckless leader? The Philippine President fired back at critics who think his decision to scrap the VFA was done ""on a whim,"" insisting he has been serious about the move from the moment he said it. ""I am terminating it. I was not joking. The day I said it was the day I decided it should be [terminated]. Alam mo (you know), they said it's subject to my whim – no,"" Duterte said. Duterte also claimed his decision was not solely based on Dela Rosa's canceled visa, but was also anchored on the US Senate's adoption of a resolution that seeks Global Magnitsky Act sanctions against Philippine officials involved in extrajudicial killings and the detention of Senator Leila de Lima. ""It started when they mentioned the US resolution in the Senate.... They were trying to figure out who will be the person who will be barred from entering. I just announced late. Pinapaupo ko (I sat on it), but at that time, I have decided if they do this, I will do it not only for Dela Rosa but for every Filipino, lalo na 'yung mga [opisyal ng] gobyerno na pupunta doon (especially government officials who will go there) supposedly for a business concern officially,"" he said. If Washington's sanctions are imposed, affected Philippine officials may be denied US visas and may have their bank accounts and assets in America frozen. What happens to Philippines-US relations? Duterte said that with his orders, he is ""slowly toning down"" the Philippines' bilateral relations with the US. He insisted that the VFA must be terminated, despite experts and some lawmakers' concerns that doing so could compromise national security and interest. Justice and foreign affairs officials have said that the Philippines is studying the VFA's possible termination, following Duterte's remarks. Malacañang earlier ordered an impact assessment on the termination of the decades-old military pact. Duterte has long expressed his dislike for the US, pushing for an ""independent foreign policy"" that has largely been characterized by a pivot from the Philippines' longtime ally to countries like China and Russia. – Rappler.com "

Undersecretary Ricardo Jalad, the executive director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), says it's better to make the NDRRMC chief a Cabinet-level position. Photo by Angie de Silva MANILA, Philippines – Whether a new disaster department is created or placed under the Office of the President, Office of the Civil Defense chief Ricardo Jalad said that the head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) should be made a ""Cabinet-level"" position. The second Senate hearing on the proposed Department of Disaster Resilience fleshed out the remaining issues on creating a department for such a huge task that is disaster management. Jalad, who is an undersecretary and the executive director of the NDRRMC, said that it doesn't really matter whether a new department is created or not, as long as the disaster council is empowered. Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go, who is among those who filed the bill, asked Jalad, ""So pabor ka ba dito sa creation, kung sakaling magiging secretary ka, pabor ka dito?"" (Would you be in favor of the creation, if you become its secretary?) ""Even if I'm not the head of that department or agency, see, I am in favor of elevating the current structure to department-level or secretary-level,"" Jalad said. Jalad said that a multi-agency approach is still better to prepare for and respond to disasters. ""Nakikita ko kasi doon sa disaster resiliency is goal nating lahat (I see that disaster resiliency is everyone's goal). It cannot be attained just by one department,"" Jalad said. Jalad had earlier said that having just one department focused on disaster management could be ""overwhelming."" Republic Act No. 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010 created the NDRRMC as the overseeing body for preparedness, response, and relief operations. (READ: Gov't eyes 'stronger' disaster management agency to replace NDRRMC) But since the NDRRMC is merely a council, stakeholders had pointed out that it doesn't have the budget nor the power to make decisions on situations that require a Cabinet rank. (READ: Urgently needed: Department for disaster resilience and climate change) At least 14 senators have filed measures for the creation of the disaster department, while some have expressed reservations if it would make processes more bureacratic. At a media interview, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said that it would be better for NDRRMC to be a medium-sized agency rather than creating a ""superdepartment"" that might encroach on other departments' mandate. ""Parang mas marami 'yung advantages kung 'authority' lang siya (There are more advantages if it's just an 'authority'), rather than cannibalizing other departments and put it under one department,"" Año told reporters on Wednesday. ""So, a plus to one is a minus to other departments. Then there will be also some overlapping of functions and probably some conflict with existing laws. Kami sa amin, whichever okay sa amin (Whichever is fine for us). We leave it to the lawmakers,"" Año said. Funding issues Senators also raised concerns about the funding requirement for the creation of a disaster department which would total to P1.7 billion, according to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). The overhead costs for manpower already amounts to P595 million, or one-third of the P1.7 billion. Operating expenses totaled to P299 million, while capital outlay is at P173 million, among others. Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado still pushed for the creation of a disaster department, saying that it would be faster to download the funds to a department than request everything from the DBM. Towards end of the hearing, however, Avisado softened his position. ""Be it a department or an authority, we need to act fast from our end. We're saying also that we want these funds released,"" Avisado said. While the bills are silent on where the national disaster risk reduction and management fund (NDRRMF) will be placed, Avisado said that the technical working group should be the one to identify that, if the measure will be passed into law. Currently, the NDRRMF is lodged under several agencies' budgets. But since it is under the special purpose funds, it can only be used with the approval of the Office of the President. For 2020, the calamity fund amounts to P20 billion. Because of the huge amount, Senator Panfilo Lacson, the chairman of the Senate committee on national defense and security, said that it shouldn't be placed under one department. ""'Pag binigay sa newly-created DDR (Department of Disaster Resilience), baka maging disastrous. Mapupunta sa overhead [expenses] 'yun,"" Lacson said, who used to be the presidential assistant for rehabilitation and recovery. (If we give it to the newly-created DDR, it might become disastrous. It might go to the overhead expenses.) Lacson said that another hearing will be set before a committee report is sponsored to the plenary. During President Rodrigo Duterte's State of the Nation Address last July 2019, he renewed his call for Congress to create the Department of Disaster Resilience. In November, the Senate said it will prioritize the creation of the department, adding that ""it's about time"" the country had its own department that oversees disaster preparedness and response. – Rappler.com "

Photo by William West/AFP SYDNEY, Australia – Scientists in Australia have successfully replicated the deadly Wuhan coronavirus, in what they said would be a ""game changer"" in the fight against a deadly epidemic which has stricken thousands. The Doherty Institute in Melbourne announced Wednesday, January 29, that it had grown the novel coronavirus in cell culture from a patient sample, the first time the virus has been replicated outside China. ""Having the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities,"" virus identification laboratory head Julian Druce said. ""It will be a game changer for diagnosis."" China was quick to sequence the genome of the coronavirus and make it public, allowing scientists around the world to develop diagnostic tools and winning praise for its efforts, in contrast to the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003. However, China has not shared the virus itself with laboratories worldwide – which the Australian lab will now do via the World Health Organization (WHO) – though the WHO announced Tuesday, January 28, that Beijing had agreed to allow a team of international experts into the country to work with their Chinese counterparts. Doherty Institute deputy director Mike Catton said the new finding meant scientists could now create an antibody test that would allow the coronavirus to be detected in patients who had not displayed any symptoms. ""An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,"" he said.

But can receiving towns absorb entire populations?  PROTOCOLS. Batangas mayors meet up to reassess disaster protocols. Photo by Rappler BATANGAS, Philippines – For decades, residents of Taal, Batangas, have never evacuated due to a Taal Volcano eruption. That changed in 2020 and caused mass panic. “Sanay ang mga taga-Taal na hindi lumilikas becasue this used to be the evacuation center. Lahat, kahit noon pang matagal na panahon. Kahit noong 1911, dito lahat. Hindi sila sanay. Ngayon lang lumikas ang taga-Taal. Even I myself, 1965 na'ndito ako, ito ang evacuation center,” said Taal Mayor Fulgencio Mercado. (Taal residents are not used to evacuating. For the longest time, this was the evacuation center. In 1911, it was here. They’re not used to this. This is the first time that Taal residents, including myself, evacuated elsewhere. In 1965, I was here, this was the evacuation center.) Over in the town of Agoncillo, residents were also unaware where to go when the volcano erupted. “We were not expecting to evacuate in a matter of hours.... What happened was, only those who went to the municipal hall were directed to evacuation centers,” Agoncillo Mayor Daniel Reyes said in Filipino. In a matter of hours, the alert level was raised from 2 to 4 on January 12. With the recent experiences, the League of Municipalities in Batangas convened to improve evacuation protocols. (IN PHOTOS: Despite remaining threat, Taal evacuees simply happy to be home) A proposal was made for a system where an entire town that is threatened goes to a designated town deemed safe from the eruption. “Pinag-uusapan namin sa League of Municipalities, in collaboration with the provincial government, na, para kung tumakbo, isa na lang ang tatakbuhan, so madali. Let’s say kung ako [sa Taal] sa Bauan, ang San Nicolas [ang pupuntahan] ay sa Batangas City, ang Laurel, kung saan man. Ganung sistema para hindi halo-halo,” Mercado said. (We’ve been discussing this in the League of Municipalities, in collaboration with the provincial government – that when residents of one town flee, they will go to just one place, so it will be easier to track them. Let’s say, I’m from [Taal], I go to Bauan.Those from San Nicolas will go to Batangas City, those from Laurel will go wherever – that kind of system so evacuees are not scattered.) However, whether an entire town's population can be absorbed by another remains a concern. Reyes said the entire population of Agoncillo is roughly around 44,000 and one town might not be able to accommodate all evacuees. – Rappler.com "

US President Donald Trump and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu take part in an announcement of Trump's Middle East peace plan in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on January 28, 2020. Photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP JERUSALEM – President Donald Trump's long delayed Middle East peace plan won support in Israel on Wednesday, January 29, but was bitterly rejected by Palestinians facing possible Israeli annexation of key parts of the West Bank. Trump, who unveiled the plan on Tuesday, January 28, at the White House standing alongside Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with no Palestinian representatives on hand, said his initiative could succeed where others had failed. Major powers and some regional players responded with caution, saying Trump's project deserves study while stressing that a durable solution to the conflict can only emerge through Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. But Trump's proposals reportedly included no Palestinian input and grants Israel much of what it has sought in decades of international diplomacy, namely control over Jerusalem as its ""undivided"" capital, rather than a city to share with the Palestinians. It also offers a US green light for Israel to annex the strategically crucial Jordan Valley – which accounts for around 30% of the West Bank – as well as other Jewish settlements in the area. ""History knocked on our door last night and gave us a unique opportunity to apply Israeli law on all of the settlements in Judea (and) Samaria,"" said Israel's rightwing Defence Minister Naftali Bennett, using the Israeli term for the occupied West Bank. The Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz, Netanyahu's main election rival in March 2 polls, embraced Trump's proposals as offering ""a strong, viable basis for advancing a peace accord with the Palestinians,"" in a statement late Tuesday. But the head of Israel's leftwing coalition Labour-Gesher-Meretz, Amir Peretz, condemned Netanyahu's expected move towards ""unilateral annexations."" Palestinian state? Trump's proposal foresees the creation of a ""contiguous"" Palestinian state but under strict conditions, including a requirement that it be ""demilitarized."" On the flashpoint issue of Jerusalem, Trump said Israel should retain control over the city as its ""undivided capital."" At the same time, the Palestinians would be allowed to declare a capital in parts of east Jerusalem beyond an Israeli security wall, the plan said. The US president also painted a future where some $50 billion in investments would eradicate the misery gripping Palestinians today. But the Palestinians angrily rejected the entire plan. ""This conspiracy deal will not pass. Our people will take it to the dustbin of history,"" Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said. The Hamas Islamist movement, which runs the Gaza Strip, said it could never accept compromise on Jerusalem being capital of a future state. Near the town of Tubas in the Jordan Valley on Wednesday, protesters waved Palestinians flags as Israeli soldiers looked on. ""If the Americans try to implement this plan the Palestinian people will make it fail,"" said 63-year-old Khaled Sawafta. A headline in the Palestinian daily newspaper Al-Hayat Al-Jadida summed up the sentiment. ""No! A thousand times No!"" it read. Mixed international reaction International reaction was at best cautiously positive. The French foreign ministry on Wednesday welcomed Trump's ""efforts"" and pledged to ""carefully study"" his proposal. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called it a ""serious proposal."" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, tore into Trump's deal as ""completely unacceptable."" The ambassadors from 3 Arab nations – Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – were at the White House, providing some evidence of Trump's claim to have growing support around the region. Saudi Arabia said it ""appreciates"" Trump's efforts and called for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks. Russia, a growing force in Mideast politics, sounded skeptical. ""We do not know if the American proposal is mutually acceptable or not,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov told Russian news agencies. Netanyahu was due in Moscow on Wednesday to present the plan in person to President Vladimir Putin.

Netanyahu was formally indicted on 3 corruption charges Tuesday after he abandoned an attempt to seek parliamentary immunity.

Securing and assisting relief operations in areas of Batangas affected by the volcano’s eruption will then be left to the Police Regional Office 4A Search and Rescue Unit under Police Brigadier General Vicente Danao, in coordination with local government units, Banac added. Earlier on Wednesday, Duterte ordered the withdrawal of the reactionary police force because they had been exposed to volcanic ash too long. ""I'm withdrawing my police.

Taal Volcano remains on Alert Level 3, characterized by a ""decreased tendency towards hazardous eruption,"" although it is still a possibility. Evacuees from areas surrounding Taal Lake began returning to their homes on Sunday, January 26, when the volcano’s status was downgraded from Alert Level 4, which had meant an explosive eruption was imminent.

File photo of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Scotland building, in Pacific Quay, Glasgow, Scotland, UK. File photo by Shutterstock LONDON, United Kingdom – The British Broadcasting Corporation on Wednesday, January 29, said it will axe 450 newsroom jobs as part of plans to adapt ""to changing audience needs"" and meet its savings target. The job cuts come just a week after BBC boss Tony Hall said he would step down, and as the corporation grapples with a equal-pay demands and questions about its future funding model. ""The BBC has to face up to the changing way audiences are using us,"" Fran Unsworth, director of news and current affairs, said in a statement. ""We have to adapt and ensure we continue to be the world's most trusted news organization, but crucially, one which is also relevant for the people we are not currently reaching,"" she added. The BBC, which has an £80 million ($104 million, 95 million euro) savings target, said it was spending too much on ""traditional linear broadcasting and not enough on digital."" One morning news magazine program will be axed, with other job losses coming from a reduction in the number of films produced by flagship political news program Newsnight. Other jobs will be lost at national radio station 5 Live, and there will be a review of the number of presenters working for the broadcaster. It noted that audiences for traditional television broadcasts continued to decline, especially amongst 16 to 34-year-olds. ""The BBC newsroom will be reorganized along a 'story-led' model, focusing on news stories more than on programs or platforms,"" said the statement. ""This is designed to reduce duplication and to ensure that BBC journalism is making as much impact as possible with a variety of audiences."" More BBC journalists will be based outside London in future, added the corporation, following criticism that it had lost touch with the rest of the country. License fee threat Like many media organizations, the BBC, which is the world's largest news broadcaster, is battling new ways to win audiences, as news and entertainment consumer habits change. Tony Hall, who leaves in 6 months after 7 years at the helm, said it needed new leadership before talks with the government in the middle of the decade over its future funding. Unsworth insisted that ""Auntie,"" as it is informally known in Britain, had ""a vital role to play locally, nationally and internationally."" ""In fact, we are fundamental to contributing to a healthy democracy in the UK and around the world,"" she added. ""If we adapt we can continue to be the most important news organization in the world."" The corporation is facing the fallout from a recent equal-pay ruling in which it was found to have discriminated against female presenter Samira Ahmed, paying her one sixth of the amount given to Jeremy Vine for hosting a similar show. The ruling opens the door to many other claims and could end up costing the corporation many millions of pounds. It is also facing pressure from Britain's new government headed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which accuses it of bias in reporting during the recent general election. Tory leader Johnson told parliament on Wednesday the BBC was ""a cherished institution and not a mortal enemy of the Conservative party."" The government has previously committed to maintain the BBC's license fee model until 2027, which earned it £3.7 billion in funding in the last financial year to April 30. A standard license costs each British household just over £154 ($202, 182 euros) a year, and is legally needed to watch any live television. But Johnson has said that ""you have to ask yourself whether that kind of approach to funding a TV media organization still makes sense."" – Rappler.com "

Dominic Thiem finally beats Rafael Nadal in a Grand Slam tournament after 5 tries. Photo from Instagram/@AustralianOpen MELBOURNE, Australia – Dominic Thiem stunned Rafael Nadal in an ""epic"" four-setter to send the world No. 1 tumbling out of the Australian Open and set up a semifinal against Alexander Zverev. The 5th seed, beaten by Nadal in the last two French Open finals, battled past the Spaniard, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 7-6 (8/6), to deny him a crack at a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title on Wednesday, January 29. He will now meet German seventh seed Zverev, who shattered the dreams of veteran Stan Wawrinka, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2, to book his maiden place in a Grand Slam last four. Awaiting the winner of that clash will be either seven-time champion Novak Djokovic or six-time winner Roger Federer, who meet in the other semifinal. ""All the match was on a very good level, I think we are both in great form,"" said Thiem, only the second Austrian to make the Melbourne semis after Thomas Muster – the man he sacked this week as an advisor. ""Today I had the feeling I was lucky in the right situation... it is necessary because he is one of the greatest of all time. You need some luck to beat him."" Thiem added that he was ecstatic at beating ""a great champion"" and ""really proud how I stayed in the match,"" which he called ""an epic."" Top seed Nadal had a 9-4 record over Thiem and had beaten him in all their 5 previous Grand Slam meetings. But the last time they played on hardcourts – at the 2018 US Open quarterfinals – it was a five-set marathon. And the signs pointed that way again, with the opening set on serve to 2-2 before Thiem, gunning for a first Grand Slam title, worked a break point but could not convert. Both baseline-huggers, it became a slugfest before Nadal managed to open some doors on the Thiem serve in game 8 and he broke with a perfect lob from the back of the court. However, Thiem came roaring back, breaking back with a ripping crosscourt return. He saved a set point to take it to a tie-breaker where he rocked Nadal to seal a one-set lead. Famous victory Nadal, dripping in sweat on a steamy Melbourne night, attacked in the 2nd set and Thiem lost his serve to love to go 3-2 behind. But the Spaniard, the 2009 champion, became riled when issued with a warning for taking too long to serve and it rattled him, sending down a double fault as Thiem squared the set at 4-4. Nadal saved a set point and it went to another tie-break where Thiem prevailed at the crunch thanks to a lucky net cord. The 3rd set was similarly tight, with no breaks until Nadal teased some errors from Thiem as he served to stay in the set, pumping his fists in celebration. But when Nadal shanked a forehand to be broken in the third game of set 4, the momentum swung back to the Austrian. Nadal lost his nerve serving for the match at 5-4 before finally getting over the line in a tie-break for a famous victory. ""Of course, I am sad. I lost an opportunity to be in the semifinals of another Grand Slam. But I lost against a great opponent. And he deserved it, too,"" said Nadal. Thiem now faces Zverev, who bounced back after being demolished in the opening set by 2014 champion Wawrinka to take control and run out a comfortable winner. Long touted as one of the next generation capable of breaking through to end the Grand Slam dominance of Nadal, Federer, and Djokovic, Zverev credited a more relaxed approach for his success in Melbourne. ""I'm doing much more things outside the court,"" he said, adding that after a poor performance at the recent ATP Cup he did not have high expectations. ""Maybe this is a stepping stone. Maybe this is how it should happen."" – Rappler.com "

Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP WASHINGTON DC, USA – President Donald Trump on Wednesday, January 29, signed the new USMCA North American trade pact with Canada and Mexico into law, pronouncing a ""glorious future"" for US industry. The USMCA, crafted over years of negotiation between the 3 countries, replaces the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Trump has long campaigned against NAFTA, which he said resulted in shipping US jobs abroad. ""Today, we are finally ending the NAFTA nightmare,"" he said at the new treaty's signing ceremony in the White House. Analysts say USMCA retains many elements of NAFTA, a mammoth deal that created a free trade zone across all of North America, shaking up entire industries and supply chains. Economists say that overall NAFTA increased growth and raised the standard of living in North America, binding the 3 countries in a complex web of trade rules and services. But the new deal does change content rules on auto manufacturing, to boost US jobs, and requires higher salaries for some Mexican auto workers. It also makes changes to e-commerce, intellectual property protections and dispute settlement for investors, as well as imposing tougher labor provisions, requiring reforms to Mexico's laws. Mexico ratified the new agreement December 10, and Canada is expected to follow suit in coming weeks. For Trump, the ""colossal victory"" of USMCA fits neatly into his ""America first"" campaign message ahead of a difficult November reelection fight and his current battle to see off impeachment over alleged abuse of power. ""Two decades of politicians ran for office vowing to replace NAFTA...yet when selected they never even tried,"" he told government members, lawmakers, union representatives and selected workers assembled at the White House's South Portico. ""I'm not like those other politicians – I guess in many ways,"" he said. ""I keep my promises."" Under NAFTA, ""we lost our jobs, we closed our factories and other countries built our cars. But we changed that,"" he said. ""The USMCA closed these terrible loopholes."" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who led Washington's negotiations both with USMCA and the recent truce in an even higher-stakes trade battle with China, called it a ""great, historic agreement."" NAFTA, he said, had been ""highly controversial from the start"" and many lawmakers subsequently ""came to regret"" their support. – Rappler.com "

So far, the novel coronavirus has claimed 132 lives in China and infected more than 6,000 people in the country and elsewhere. New cases were reported in Finland and the United Arab Emirates. The WHO called an urgent meeting for Thursday, January 30 over whether the viral epidemic should be declared a global health emergency – a designation that can lead to increased international coordination. Airlines around the world are either suspending or paring back services in and out of China, following cases of human-to-human transmission outside the country. In the sporting world, the World Indoor Athletics Championships set for March in Nanjing have been pushed back to 2021, and World Cup skiing races have been cancelled. ""WHO is monitoring this outbreak every moment of every day,"" the organization's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva, as he announced his decision to convene crisis talks. On Twitter, Tedros said the organization ""deeply regrets"" what he called a ""human error"" in WHO reports last week that referred to the global risk of the outbreak as ""moderate"" instead of ""high."" Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters that ""the whole world needs to be on alert now. The whole world needs to take action."" Ryan said declaring a global health emergency could streamline the measures taken – a preferable scenario to the ""potential recipe for disaster"" of nearly 200 nations acting individually. Both Tedros and Ryan hailed China for its ""extraordinary"" efforts so far to contain the epidemic. Airlifts in full swing In China, some countries worked to airlift their citizens out of the central city of Wuhan, whose 11 million residents are now under strict quarantine. A US charter flight from Wuhan with about 210 Americans on board, including consular staff, was met at a California military base on Wednesday by emergency vehicles with flashing lights and personnel in white biological hazard suits. The evacuees will be monitored for symptoms and sent to local hospitals if they are found to be ill, the Pentagon said. More than 200 Japanese nationals were brought home Wednesday, but only a handful of them were hospitalized for tests after they reported they felt unwell or showed flu-like symptoms. Some 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans will be flown out of Wuhan on board two French planes this week. Australia plans to house any citizens evacuated on an island normally used to detain asylum seekers. A growing number of governments – including the United States, Britain and Germany – have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China. China has urged its own citizens to delay trips abroad, with more than 15 other countries having confirmed cases of the disease, including 3 with cases of human-to-human transmission. Flights scrapped, stores closed British Airways was the first major airline to announce a suspension of flights to and from China, citing the travel advice of Britain's foreign office. Many others followed suit, including German flag carrier Lufthansa, which said all flights to mainland China would be suspended until February 9. Others pared back their service, like American Airlines, KLM, and United. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific has reduced flights, citing low demand and the city government's response plan to the virus. In one of the most dramatic measures, the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea announced no travellers from Asia would be allowed in. ""Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak,"" Tedros said. 'I need to buy food' China has effectively cut off Hubei province to try to contain the spread of the virus, banned tour groups from traveling overseas, suspended classes and extended the Lunar New Year holiday. Most street traffic in and around Wuhan – where the virus originated in a wild animal market – has been banned, leaving more than 50 million people shuttered in their homes. ""This is the first day since the lockdown that I've had to go out,"" a man in his 50s told AFP on the mostly deserted streets of the industrial city on Wednesday. ""I have no choice because I need to buy food."" The number of confirmed cases across China climbed to 5,974, while the death toll nationwide jumped to 132. The scale of the deepening crisis was emphasized with the total number of infections on the Chinese mainland exceeding that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03. But the death toll is so far much lower than SARS, which claimed nearly 800 lives around the world –  with most fatalities in mainland China and Hong Kong. Economic pain The virus has rattled global markets and started to dent the Chinese economy. Japanese automaker Toyota said it would keep its plants in China closed until at least February 9. Swedish furniture giant IKEA will temporarily close half of its 30 stores on the mainland.

In this photo taken on January 25, 2020, medical staff wearing protective clothing arrive with a patient at the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan. Photo by Hector Retamal/AFP WUHAN, China (UPDATED) – China reported its biggest single-day jump in novel coronavirus deaths on Thursday, January 30, as confirmation that 3 Japanese evacuated from the outbreak's epicenter were infected deepened fears about a global contagion. The World Health Organization, which initially downplayed the severity of a disease that has now killed 170 nationwide, warned all governments to be ""on alert"" as it weighed whether to declare a global health emergency. As foreign countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, the locked-down city where the virus was first detected, concern over the economic impact has steadily intensified. Airlines have suspended services to China and companies from Starbucks to Tesla have shuttered stores and production lines. Chinese authorities have taken extraordinary steps to arrest the virus's spread, including effectively locking down more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. But that was yet to pay dividends, with the government reporting 38 new deaths in the 24 hours to Thursday, the highest one-day total. All but one were in Hubei. The number of confirmed new cases also grew steadily to 7,711, the National Health Commission said. Another 81,000 people were under observation for possible infection. The pathogen is believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild game, spreading far and wide by a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically or abroad. 'Totally new situation' Japan's infection rate grew to 11 after 3 Japanese citizens among more than 200 on an evacuation flight Wednesday, January 29, tested positive. Officials had already confirmed two cases in which patients tested positive without having travelled to China, adding to anxiety over human-to-human transmission of the respiratory disease. ""We are in a truly new situation,"" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament. The fact that 2 of the 3 new confirmed Japanese cases showed no symptoms underscored the scale of the challenge for health workers. The WHO has come under fire after it last week declined to declare a global health emergency. The global health body's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed regret for what he called a ""human error"" in the WHO's assessment. WHO's Emergency Committee will meet Thursday to decide whether to declare an emergency – which could lead to travel or trade barriers. ""The whole world needs to take action,"" Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, told reporters in Geneva. A US charter flight from Wuhan arrived Wednesday at a California military base with nearly 200 consular staff and other Americans, who ""cheered loudly"" when the jet touched down, said an official with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All passengers were declared symptom-free but will remain isolated for days while they are monitored. Some 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans will be flown out of Wuhan on board two French planes this week. Australia plans to house any citizens it evacuates from the city on an island normally used to detain asylum seekers. A growing number of governments – including the United States, Britain and Germany – have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China. China also has urged its own citizens to delay trips abroad, after more than 15 countries confirmed infections. Flights scrapped, stores closed Major airlines that have suspended or pared back service to China include British Airways, German flag carrier Lufthansa, American Airlines, KLM, and United. China efforts to halt the virus have seen the suspension of classes nationwide and an extension of the Lunar New Year holiday. Most street traffic in and around Wuhan has been banned. ""This is the first day since the lockdown that I've had to go out,"" a man in his 50s told Agence France-Presse on the mostly deserted streets of the industrial city. ""I have no choice because I need to buy food."" China's football body meanwhile said it was postponing ""all levels and all types of football matches across the country,"" including the country's top-tier Chinese Super League, in response to the outbreak. Economic worries Japanese automaker Toyota, Swedish furniture giant IKEA, tech giant Foxconn, Starbucks, Tesla and McDonald's were among major corporate giants to temporarily freeze production or close large numbers of outlets in China. As the ""world's factory,"" the disruptions in China are expected to send ripples through supply chains globally, denting profits. US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the new coronavirus posed a fresh risk to a fragile world economy, adding that the US central bank was on alert. ""There will clearly be implications at least in the near term for Chinese output and I would guess for some of their close neighbors,"" Powell said. The contagion has spread to nearly every corner of China, with remote Tibet reporting its first case on Thursday. It has triggered fears in part due to its striking similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which also began in China and eventually killed nearly 800 people worldwide. – Rappler.com "

US President Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor, John Bolton, speaking during the International Conference for Democracy in Venezuela in Lima on August 6, 2019. Photo by HO/Peruvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – President Donald Trump lashed out on Wednesday, January 29 at John Bolton, a potentially damaging witness at his Senate impeachment trial, amid White House efforts to block publication of an explosive book by the former national security advisor. The fight over whether Bolton should testify intensified as Trump's trial entered a new phase, with senators who hold the 45th US president's fate in their hands directly questioning prosecutors and White House defense lawyers. The 100 members of the Senate have been sitting silently for 6 days listening to impassioned arguments for and against Trump's removal from office for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They now have 16 hours over the next two days to submit written questions, which are being read aloud by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, presiding over just the third impeachment trial of a president in US history. Democrats have been pressing for the Senate to subpoena Bolton, who was fired by Trump in September, after reports that his upcoming White House tell-all book corroborates the abuse-of-power impeachment charge against the president over his dealings with Ukraine. Asked whether the 71-year-old Bolton should appear, chief Democratic prosecutor Adam Schiff said his testimony was essential to conduct a ""fair trial."" ""Don't wait for the book,"" the California lawmaker told the senators sitting as trial jurors. ""This case is overwhelmingly clear without John Bolton but if you have any question about it you can erase all doubt. ""When you have a witness who is as plainly relevant as John Bolton, who goes to the heart of the most serious and egregious of the president's misconduct, who has volunteered to come and testify – to turn him away, to look the other way, I think is deeply at odds with being an impartial juror,"" Schiff said. White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin countered that the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, which impeached the Republican president on December 18, had conducted their inquiry in a ""half-baked partisan fashion"" and had not issued their own subpoena for Bolton's testimony. Philbin said having Bolton testify would present ""grave security issues."" The White House would seek to prevent his testimony by citing executive privilege and the matter would end up in the courts, he said. ""This institution will be effectively paralyzed for months on end."" 'World War 6' In his book, Bolton reportedly writes that the president personally told him in August that a freeze in military aid to Ukraine was directly linked to his demand that Kiev investigate Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Trump, in an early-morning tweet, said Bolton had shown poor judgment in a job he had begged for and he hired the veteran diplomat and prominent ""hawk"" against the advice of others. Bolton ""got fired because frankly, if I listened to him, we would be in World War 6 by now,"" Trump said. ""(He) goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this?"" The White House cited national security in a bid to block Bolton's book, saying it cannot be published because it breaks secrecy laws. The warning was made in a letter to Bolton's lawyer dated January 23 but only made public on Wednesday. The National Security Council said after preliminary review of the manuscript – a vetting process applied to any White House employees writing books – that it contained ""significant amounts of classified information."" ""Some of this information is at the TOP SECRET level,"" the NSC said in a letter to Bolton's lawyer, adding that ""the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information."" Trump called on Republicans to reject a push for witnesses when the issue comes up for a vote on Friday, January 31. ""Remember Republicans, the Democrats already had 17 witnesses, we were given NONE!"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Don't let the Dems play you!"" A two-thirds majority – 67 senators – is needed to convict the president and remove him from office and the Republicans' 53-47 majority in the chamber virtually assures Trump will be acquitted. But only 51 senators are needed to call witnesses and Utah Senator Mitt Romney and several other Republicans have said they are leaning to having Bolton and others testify. Only two other presidents have been put on trial in the Senate – Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999, and neither was convicted and removed. Before the explosive revelations about what Bolton knew, the White House had assumed the trial could be wrapped up with no witnesses and an acquittal by this weekend, just in time for Trump's annual State of the Union address before Congress on Tuesday, February 4. – Rappler.com "

The latest decision set aside the COA's June 2016 ruling that disallowed the write-off on the basis that the DOST failed to exhaust all means of demanding payment from the victims. In the latest ruling, the COA made it clear that write-offs are not equivalent to condonation or release of the debt obligation, and that the agency can still demand payment should the loans become collectible. Write-offs simply allow the agency to maintain a more updated assessment of its current assets. The DOST, tasked then to implement livelihood projects for Pinatubo victims, granted loans to families displaced by the Pinatubo eruption. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo on June 15, 1991, is considered the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. According to data from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, the eruption left 717 dead and affected 1.25 million people. – Rappler.com "

In this photo taken on April 29, 2015, Cristina Sergio attends a press conference in Manila, after being accused of duping Mary Jane Veloso into carrying 2.6 kilograms of heroin to Indonesia from Malaysia. Photo by Rappler  MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A Nueva Ecija court found the recruiters of overseas Filipino worker Mary Jane Veloso guilty of illegal recruitment in a separate case – a verdict that Veloso's lawyers said would have a significant impact on her case in Indonesia. The Baloc, Nueva Ecija Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 88 sentenced Ma Cristina Sergio and Julius Lacanilao to life imprisonment during the reading of the verdict on Thursday morning, January 30. Sergio and Lacanilao were also ordered to pay a fine of P2 million. ""The prosecution having sufficiently established the guilt of both accused, Maria Cristina P. Sergio and Julius Lacanilao beyons reasonable doubt, this Court finds them guilty of large scale illegal recruitment under Section 6 in relation to Section 7(a) of Republic Act No. 8042 as amended by Section 5 of Republic Act 10022,"" Branch Presiding Judge Anarica Castillo-Reyes said in her verdict. National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) Spokesperson Josa Deinla said the case was filed by Lorna Valino, Ana Marie Gonzales, and Jenalyn Paraiso. ""We are of course glad that justice has been served even if only partially and initially with respect to Mary Jane’s fellow victims,"" said NUPL President Edre Olalia. ""Even if their case is distinct from Mary Jane's, we believe that Sergio and Lacanilao's conviction stands as a testament to Mary Jane's story – that she was not a drug courier but an unwitting victim of the same illegal recruiters,"" Olalia added. Impact on Mary Jane's case Veloso has her own trafficking case against Sergio and Lacanilao pending before the same court, but the trial had been on hold because Veloso had yet to testify. (READ: The story of Mary Jane Veloso, in her own words) Veloso and her lawyers almost lost the chance to have the OFW testify because Lacanilao and Sergio had earlier blocked the testimony. The Court of Appeals sided with the recruiters, but in a last-minute save by the Supreme Court in October 2019, Veloso would now be allowed to testify via deposition from her jail cell in Indonesia. ""Her deposition in Indonesia is still subject to final legal resolution before the RTC and the Supreme Court,"" the NUPL said. The NUPL believed that the conviction of Lacanilao and Sergio for illegal recruitment would have a significant impact on Veloso's case. The lawyers' group, in turn, hoped that if they secured a conviction in the local case, it could also affect Veloso's drug trafficking conviction in Indonesia. ""We look forward to the full achievement of justice when the other case of Mary Jane is resolved and she herself is ultimately and finally sent home free in time. We all owe it to millions of our fellow citizens who meet misfortune at the hands of unscrupulous people who take advantage of their vulnerabilities,"" said Olalia. Veloso had claimed that she was only duped to carry illegal drugs, for which she was convicted and put on death row in Indonesia. Veloso was given a reprieve to give way to the local trial. – Rappler.com "

Vanessa Bryant (second from left) says 'it’s impossible to imagine life without' her husband Kobe and daughter Gianna. Photo by Harry How/Getty Images/AFP MANILA, Philippines – Vanessa Bryant said her family is “completely devastated” over the death of her husband and NBA legend Kobe and daughter Gianna, saying “there aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now.” In her first public comment since Kobe, Gianna and 7 others died in a helicopter crash, Vanessa also grieved for the other families who lost their loved ones and thanked “the millions of people who’ve shown support and love during this horrific time.” “Thank you for all the prayers. We definitely need them. We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe – the amazing father of our children; and my beautiful, sweet Gianna – a loving, thoughtful, and wonderful daughter, and amazing sister to Natalia, Bianka, and Capri,” she wrote. Vanessa, who married Kobe in 2001 when she was still a teenager, also thanked everyone for the outpouring of love and support worldwide in an Instagram post on Wednesday, January 29 (Thursday, January 30, Philippine time), 3 days after the fatal crash. “There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved. We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon,” she said. Los Angeles authorities recovered on Tuesday the remains of all 9 who died in the crash. (READ: All 9 bodies recovered from Kobe Bryant helicopter crash site) Kobe’s body was officially identified along with 3 others using fingerprints, but Gianna’s has yet to be identified. (READ: Kobe Bryant's body identified by coroners) To support the families of the other victims, Vanessa said the Mamba Sports Foundation also set up the MambaOnThree Fund. Vanessa and Kobe met on the set of a video shoot for which she was modeling. She was 17 and a senior in high school at the time. They were engaged in 2001 before getting married 6 months later. They had 4 daughters together. The oldest Natalia is 17 while Bianka is 3 years old and Capri just 7 months. Kobe's parents didn't attend the wedding, partly because Kobe's father was uncomfortable with Vanessa being Latino instead of African-American. In 2003, Kobe was accused of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman at a Colorado hotel. Vanessa attended a news conference at Staples Center arena in Los Angeles and sat next to Kobe as he professed his love to her. ""I love my wife with all my heart. She's my backbone,"" Kobe said from the podium. Kobe admitted in front of her to being unfaithful but denied sexual assault. The case was eventually dismissed after the accuser dropped the charges. “I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way,” said Vanessa. “Our love for them is endless – and that’s to say, immeasurable. I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever.”   – With a report from Agence France-Presse "
831,250555,"January 30, 2020",Middle East,Palestinians protest against Trump's Middle East peace plan,Agence France-Presse,"The terms of the plan are roundly rejected by Palestinian leaders, with president Mahmud Abbas vowing the proposal would end up in the dustbin of history  DRACULA. Palestinians carry a mock coffin bearing the portrait of US President Donald Trump during a demonstration in the West Bank city of Nablus on January 28, 2020. Photo by Jaafar Ashitiyeh/AFP JERUSALEM – The Israeli army announced an increased presence in the West Bank and near Gaza Wednesday evening, January 29, as US President Donald Trump's controversial peace plan sparked outrage among Palestinians. The plan, seen as overwhelmingly supportive of Israeli goals and drafted with no Palestinian input, gives the Jewish state a US green light to annex key parts of the occupied West Bank. It was widely cheered in Israel, but sparked fury among Palestinians, with protests breaking out in the West Bank and the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. One rocket was fired from the strip Wednesday evening. In response, the army said, ""(Israeli) fighter jets and aircraft struck a number of Hamas terror targets in the southern Gaza Strip."" Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli security forces clashed in various locations in the West Bank and further Palestinian protests are expected in the coming days. The Israeli army announced Wednesday it would deploy additional troops in the West Bank and the near the Gaza Strip. ""Following the ongoing situation assessment, it has been decided to reinforce the Judea and Samaria and Gaza Divisions with additional combat troops,"" the army said in a statement, using the Israeli terms for the West Bank. Trump, who unveiled the peace plan on Tuesday, January 28 at the White House alongside Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with no Palestinian representatives present, said his initiative could succeed where others had failed. But the plan grants Israel much of what it has sought in decades of international diplomacy, namely control over Jerusalem as its ""undivided"" capital, rather than a city to share with the Palestinians. It also offers US approval for Israel to annex the strategically crucial Jordan Valley, which accounts for around 30% of the West Bank, as well as other Jewish settlements in the territory. The terms have been roundly rejected by Palestinian leaders, with president Mahmud Abbas vowing the proposal would end up in the dustbin of history. Abbas is expected to visit the UN in the next two weeks to address the Security Council and explain his rejection of the plan, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN said Wednesday. Hamas said it could never accept anything short of Jerusalem as capital of a future Palestinian state. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged the Palestinians to ""come up with a counter-offer."" ""I know the Israelis would be prepared to sit down and negotiate on the basis of the vision that the president laid out,"" Pompeo said, as he headed to Britain on a five-nation tour. 'United against the deal' In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, demonstrators threw rocks at Israeli border guards who responded with rounds of tear gas. Three protesters were hospitalized after being hit by Israeli fire in clashes near Ramallah in the central West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said. In Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, protesters set tires alight, while others hoisted banners vowing they were ""united against the deal of the century,"" in a jibe against Trump's proposals. Trump's plan foresees the creation of a ""contiguous"" Palestinian state but under strict conditions, including a requirement that it be ""demilitarized."" The Palestinians would only be allowed to declare a capital in outer parts of east Jerusalem, beyond an Israeli security wall. Those terms were warmly received by some in Israel. ""History knocked on our door last night and gave us a unique opportunity to apply Israeli law on all of the settlements in Judea (and) Samaria,"" said Israel's rightwing Defense Minister Naftali Bennett. The Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz, Netanyahu's main election rival in March 2 polls, embraced Trump's proposals as offering ""a strong, viable basis for advancing a peace accord with the Palestinians."" But the head of Israel's leftwing coalition Labour-Gesher-Meretz, Amir Peretz, condemned Netanyahu's expected move towards ""unilateral annexations."" Meanwhile, on the streets of Tel Aviv, some residents voiced concern that Trump had paid no attention to what the Palestinians actually want. ""It sounds like an excessive implementation of Israel's ambitions, with harsh, aggressive ignorance of Palestinian ambitions,"" said Tel Aviv resident Uri. Cautious response Major powers and some regional players responded with caution, saying Trump's project deserves study, while stressing that a durable solution to the conflict can only emerge through Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The French foreign ministry welcomed Trump's ""efforts"" and pledged to ""carefully study"" his proposal. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, slammed Trump's plan as ""completely unacceptable."" The ambassadors from three Arab nations – Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain – were at the White House, providing some evidence of Trump's claim to have growing support around the region. Saudi Arabia said it ""appreciates"" Trump's efforts and called for direct Israeli-Palestinian talks. Russia, a growing force in Middle East politics, sounded sceptical. ""We do not know if the American proposal is mutually acceptable or not,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov told Russian news agencies. – Rappler.com "

The veteran essayist is being investigated by French police after a leading French publishing executive detailed how he abused her when she was 14 in an explosive new bestseller. ""A tourist should not behave like that,"" the 83-year-old told a French television channel in Italy, where he has fled to escape the storm the revelations stirred. French publishing houses pulled his works from bookshops last month, a move that Matzneff has denounced as a ""wave of neo-puritanism."" ""I find it stupid, extravagant that in 2020 I am facing grief for books I wrote more than 40 years ago,"" he said. But in the new interview with BFMTV, a rolling news channel, he was more contrite. ""An adult should turn their head away and resist the temptation. Naturally, if I did something that was not good I regret it.

Matzneff never made any secret of his sexual preference for adolescent girls and boys and it did not stop him winning the Renaudot prize in 2013. He also was awarded major state honours in France: Officer of Arts and Letters and Knight of the Order of National Merit. And the writer even enjoyed a special pension and reduced rent for his apartment in a chic district of the French capital. The case has shone a light on what many see as an overly permissive attitude towards the sexual harassment and sexual abuse of children in France. (READ: French bishops beg forgiveness from pedophilia victims) 'It's like the Soviet Union' In Les Moins de Seize Ans, (The Under 16s), first published in 1974 and reissued in 2005, Matzneff was frank about indulging his obsession for underage partners and sex tourism. In the 1990s, he told French television that ""a very young girl is rather sweeter, even if she becomes very quickly hysterical and just as crazy as she will be when she is older."" But attitudes toward the writer changed dramatically after publisher Vanessa Springora revealed her tortured relationship with him in her book ""Consent,"" published on January 2.

Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer dispute another title berth. Photos by Ben Stansall and Glyn Kirk AFP  MELBOURNE, Australia – Novak Djokovic is ever respectful of ""great fighter"" Roger Federer, but the Serb goes into their Australian Open semifinal as clear favorite after beating the Swiss maestro in every Grand Slam meeting since Wimbledon 2012. The pair enjoy one of world sport's greatest rivalries and will be facing each other on Thursday, January 30 for a 50th time stretching back to 2006. Djokovic leads 26-23. While Federer won their last clash at the ATP Finals in November, the Serb has a psychological edge at the Slams, beating him in all 5 showdowns since losing in the All England club semis 8 years ago. Sixteen-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic has also been in fine touch at Melbourne Park as he targets a record eighth title, dropping just one set en route to the last four. In contrast, Federer has lived dangerously, two points from defeat against John Millman in the third round and incredibly saving 7 match points in his quarterfinal against Tennys Sandgren. Djokovic pointed to Federer's heroics in that epic as to why he can never be written off, despite being 38 and in the twilight of his career. ""What he did (against Sandgren) was amazing. He showed me he's one of the best players of all time. I mean, he never gives up. When it matters the most, he's focused and he plays his best tennis,"" said the world No. 2. ""He's a great fighter. Obviously I have lots of respect for him."" Federer and Djokovic have dominated the Australian Open for years with the all-conquering pair sharing 12 of the last 14 titles.

""I mean, Novak also has gone on all these runs like I did for 10 years. He did the same for the last 10 years. It helps when you start the year off with a bang. We were able to do that quite a few times."" Djokovic insists his record over Federer at the Slams since 2012 doesn't tell the full story, pointing to their classic Wimbledon final last year. In that memorable fight, the Swiss had two match points and was one shot from victory. ""It's not like I've been dominating the match-ups. I've had success against him, in Grand Slams in particular. But Roger is Roger,"" he said. ""You know that he's always going to play on such a high level, regardless of the surface. ""He loves to play these kind of matches, big rivalries, semis, finals of Grand Slams. I mean, he'll probably confirm that that's probably the biggest reason why he's still competing."" Federer goes into Thursday's blockbuster on Rod Laver Arena after playing 14 grueling sets in his last three matches, but insisted ""I feel pretty good right now"". He is also under an injury cloud after a rare medical timeout midway through his quarterfinal for a groin strain which hampered his movement. He dropped two sets after comfortably taking the first, before rallying to come through in five. ""I don't know if you can call it an injury. It's just pain and problems,"" he said afterwards.

In this file photo taken on October 23, 2019 a giant digital sign is seen at Facebook's corporate headquarters campus in Menlo Park, California. Photo by Josh Edelson/AFP SAN FRANCISCO, USA – Facebook on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and user growth stronger than most forecasts, but shares took a hit in after-market trade. The leading online social network said net income rose 7% from a year ago to $7.3 billion, while revenue increased 25% to $21 billion in the final 3 months of last year. The number of people using Facebook monthly climbed 8% to 2.5 billion; for all its apps including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, the figure was 2.89 billion. Shares, however, quickly dropped more than 7% for reasons that were not immediately clear. ""We had a good quarter and a strong end to the year as our community and business continue to grow,"" said Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. Investors may be concerned by continuing increases in the amount of money Facebook spends as it pours resources into protecting privacy and preventing the platform from being used as a platform for hate speech, abuse, and disinformation. Costs in the recently ended 4th quarter rose 34% to $12.2 billion. Facebook ended the year with its employee ranks up 26% to nearly 45,000. Shares may have also been weighed down by worries about privacy regulations hobbling the company's ability to effectively target its money-making ads. Facebook chief financial officer Dave Wehner told analysts the company expects revenue growth to slow, in part due to regulations and ""other ad-targeting related headwinds."" Recent data privacy regulations in Europe and California as well as enhancements to browser or operating system software from Google and Apple, along with tools added by Facebook itself, are expected to limit the ability of the social network to use ""signals"" from third-party websites to more finely target ads, Wehner said. Delivering gains Facebook posted gains in advertising, which represents the vast majority of its revenues, up 25% at $20.7 billion in the quarter, and expanded its user base. ""Despite all of the concerns that have been swirling around the company in the past two years, it beat expectations on revenue, and it demonstrated continued growth in its user base,"" said eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson. ""This is a company that has shown that it can withstand ongoing criticism of its practices and yet still pull out gains in both revenue and users."" The market tracking firm expects Facebook's momentum to continue, with advertisers increasing spending at the social network and its Instagram service. Facebook has faced a barrage of criticism recently for the misuse of users' data to influence elections amid increasing calls for the California-based internet titan to be regulated. Facebook this week began rolling out a new tool allowing users of the social network to view and delete data it collects from third parties. The feature is part of an effort by Facebook to shore up its image in the wake of a series of privacy scandals, including the hijacking of personal data on millions of users by a British consultancy developing voter profiles for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Zuckerberg felt that Facebook is ready to defend against efforts to maliciously use its services to sway the coming US presidential election or widen rifts between voters. ""We're very focused on election integrity, and this is an area where I'm proud of the progress that we've made in preventing foreign interference,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We were behind in 2016, but after working to protect elections and countries across the world for the past few years, we think our systems are now more advanced."" – Rappler.com "

The firm is the flagship subsidiary of the giant Samsung Group, by far the largest of the family-controlled conglomerates known as ""chaebols"" that dominate business in the world's 12th-largest economy. But it suffered a series of difficulties in 2019, with the global memory chip market – which has driven profits in recent years – hit by rising supply and falling demand. The premium smartphone market has also grown fiercely competitive, with buyers waiting longer before upgrading to new models. Samsung said it expects ""weak sales from seasonality in memory chips, OLED and consumer electronics"" in the first quarter of 2020 as the firm navigates ""continued uncertainties in the global business environment"". Operating profit dropped more than 30% year-on-year to 7.2 trillion won, while sales in the fourth quarter stood at 59.9 trillion won. For full-year 2019, the firm reported net profits of 21.7 trillion won, down 51% from a year ago. Samsung has been strained by a trade war between China and the US and caught in a diplomatic row between Seoul and Tokyo over wartime history, with Japan imposing tough restrictions on exports crucial to South Korean tech giants in July. In another shadow hanging over the firm, its vice chairman and de-facto leader Lee Jae-yong is on trial for the second time over a sprawling corruption scandal that led to the impeachment of South Korea's former president Park Geun-hye. A guilty verdict and long prison sentence would deprive the firm of its top decision maker. Lee was initially jailed for five years in 2017 on multiple charges including bribery, then released after several of his convictions were quashed, only for the Supreme Court in August to order a retrial. 'Enhanced' 5G devices In the mobile business, strong demand for Samsung's mid-range A-series handsets gave the firm a much-needed boost over the last few quarters, said Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst at IHS Markit. The premium devices, such as the latest Galaxy Note that was widely available in the fourth quarter, faced competition from Apple – which reported its best-ever quarter powered by the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models. ""A strong quarter from Apple in key markets will have had an impact on Samsung,"" Schneemann told AFP. In 2020, Samsung is pinning its hopes on increasing availability of 5G telecom services driving sales of its handsets – it is a world leader in the technology – and said it will roll out an ""enhanced"" 5G lineup. Global demand for the superfast 5G handsets in 2019 was higher than expected, with nearly 19 million units shipped worldwide, according to the latest data from market researcher Strategy Analytics. Samsung held 36% of market share, it said, closely trailing Huawei, which was leading the tight race with 37%, although most of its shipments were in China, where US sanctions made relatively less impact. ""Samsung's 5G smartphone shipments are international and span a wide spread of countries, from South Korea to the UK to the United States,"" said Ville-Petteri Ukonaho, Associate Director at Strategy Analytics. Samsung said earlier this month it had shipped more than 6.7 million Galaxy 5G smartphone devices globally last year, claiming it had more than half the world's 5G smartphone market as of November. The firm is due to unveil new Galaxy devices next month in San Francisco that it said – without offering details – will ""shape the next decade of mobile experiences"".

Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum Jr gives senators an update on the condition of Taal Volcano on January 30, 2020. Photo by Joseph Vidal/Senate PRIB MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) maintained Alert Level 3 for Taal Volcano on Thursday, January 30, saying that there continues to be movement of magma underneath. Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum Jr explained in a hearing of the Senate committee on urban planning, housing, and resettlement that they again recorded what is called a harmonic tremor, or rhythmic shaking associated with magma movement, early on Thursday. ""The harmonic tremor is an indication na may umaakyat pang magma.... Actually, mas mataas po ang bilang ng earthquakes for the past 24 hours than the previous [24-hour period],"" Solidum said. (The harmonic tremor is an indication that there's still rising magma.... Actually, we had more earthquakes in the past 24 hours than the previous [24-hour period].) In its 8 am bulletin on Thursday, Phivolcs said the Taal Volcano Network recorded 137 volcanic earthquakes in the past 24 hours, compared to the previous figure of 123. These include the harmonic tremor, which lasted for 97 seconds, and two low-frequency events. Low-frequency quakes are ""caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface,"" according to the United States Geological Survey. Meanwhile, the Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 763 volcanic earthquakes since 1 pm of January 12. Of these, 177 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. That same network also plotted 7 volcanic earthquakes from 5 am on Wednesday, January 29, until 5 am on Thursday, at magnitudes 1.7 to 2.5 with no felt event. Phivolcs had lowered Taal's status to Alert Level 3 from Alert Level 4 last Sunday, January 26. When it did so, it warned that volcanic activity could either ease further – leading to Alert Level 2 – or escalate again – meaning a possible return to Alert Level 4. ""When we lowered the alert level, we based it on what the volcano is showing us. We were hoping that there will be [a] continuous [downward] trend of all the parameters that we are seeing to lower it to 2,"" Solidum said. ""Usually our observation period, dalawang linggo po 'yan. Kaya lang po...meron tayong nakitang harmonic tremor (Usually our observation period is two weeks. But we saw a harmonic tremor earlier)."" Solidum then went on to say that out of around 80 million cubic meters of magma at Taal, only around 30 million cubic meters had been released from January 12 to 13, the first two days of the volcanic unrest. ""At this moment, 'yung magma ay nando'n sa around 5 kilometers [below the crater], parang nag-park muna siya. 'Yun po 'yung binabantayan natin, kung ano pang ikikilos nito.... Tumigil na lang sana siya,"" Solidum said. (At this moment, the magma is around 5 kilometers below the crater, virtually parked there. That's what we're monitoring, whether it will rise further or not.... We hope it'll just stop.) In the past 24 hours, Phivolcs also observed ""weak emission of white to dirty white steam-laden plumes 300 to 500 meters tall"" coming from Taal's main crater. The level of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emitted was ""below instrumental detection"" or too low to be detected. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. Phivolcs reiterated that under Alert Level 3, the following might still occur: Taal Volcano Island; the barangays of Bilibinwang, Subic Ilaya, and Banyaga in Agoncillo; and the barangays of Gulod, Buso-Buso, and Bugaan East in Laurel remain on lockdown. These areas are within a 7-kilometer radius from the main crater, which is Phivolcs' recommended danger zone while Taal is under Alert Level 3.

Batangas Governor Hermilando Mandanas said in a news briefing on Thursday, January 30, that under the scheme, the provincial government will buy ash collected by residents involved in the cleanup in their areas. The ash would be used for hollow blocks to be produced by cooperatives, and the end product would be sold with the help of the provincial government. “Ash will be accumulated by residents and they will be paid for the ash. We are now organizing cooperatives where we can put hollow block making machines. We can also use the ash as fertilizers,” the governor said. Mandanas said the provincial government will offer the finished product to construction companies. Joe Alilio, deputy head of the Batangas Provincial Cooperative, Livelihood and Entrepreneurial Development Office (PCLEDO) said that they would tap cooperatives in the affected municipalities to lead the project. “We are still determining the price per kilo or per ton. We will study the costing so that the coops and residents can earn. We are already mobilizing, and we will also coordinate with other stakeholders to ensure that there is a market for whatever is produced,” Alilio said.

Ramona Diaz introduces her film during its premiere at Sundance. Photo by Jovelle Tamayo/Sundance MANILA, Philippines – That Ramona Diaz’s documentary about the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte eventually zoomed in on Rappler and its CEO, Maria Ressa, seems to have been destined. The documentary filmmaker, whose work has tackled everything from Filipino rock stars to the wife of a dictator, arrived in Manila on February 12, 2019 – exactly a day before Ressa's arrest at the Rappler headquarters over a cyber libel complaint for a 5-year-old story. “It was like…ok, here we go. Fasten your seatbelts,” Diaz recalled during the “Truthtellers Panel” at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26. A Thousand Cuts, which chronicles the struggles of press freedom and democracy under Duterte, premiered in the festival in the US Documentary Competition. Maria’s 2019 arrest jumpstarted an entire year of legal battles against Rappler, among the news organizations critical of Duterte and his policies, including, and especially, his bloody “war on drugs.” “You’ll go away thinking that there are a lot of similarities between what’s happened here [the US] and the Philippines – and really, worldwide – this rise of authoritarianism, this rise of fear and [people asking] where do they go to, where do they turn to? The strong men, right? It’s a global story,” said Diaz. In A Thousand Cuts, Diaz talks not only to Ressa and Rappler but to personalities in the Duterte administration including entertainer-turned-government-official Mocha Uson and Senator Ronald dela Rosa, who as Duterte's police chief first led the “drug war.” The Asian-American experience The idea behind what would eventually be A Thousand Cuts was vague at first, Diaz said. Fresh off Motherland, a documentary on the country’s national maternity hospital, the Filipino-American filmmaker only had a “vague notion” of wanting to do something about Duterte and the drug war. It was in the process of research that she met Ressa. “We met and I knew that she was going to be a big part of the story,” said Diaz, describing the veteran journalist as “compelling and articulate about what’s happening to the country.” And while the film focuses on press freedom, disinformation, and the rise of authoritarianism, it also touches on a topic close to both the filmmaker and her subject’s hearts: the Asian-American experience. “It just dawned on me that I relate to her very much on that level,” said Diaz. The two women – arguably, pioneers in their fields – are both Filipino-Americans. They also both bore the brunt of being brown in America. “She talks about landing in Toms River, being a brown kid, not speaking the language and trying to run away from everything brown because what was that, the '80s? [It was 1973] and so that’s what you did then,” said Diaz. “Talking about how you had to work 100% or 110% in order to feel that you deserved being there – I totally related to that. I knew what that felt like,” the filmmaker said, talking about “living in a space between the Philippines and the US.” A Thousand Cuts debuted at the Utah-based festival to a standing ovation. – Rappler.com  "

Illuminated Huawei and 5G signs are on display during the 10th Global mobile broadband forum hosted by Chinese tech giant Huawei in Zurich on October 15, 2019. Photo by Stefan Wermuth/AFP BRUXELLES, Belgium – EU countries could ban telecoms operators deemed a security risk from critical parts of 5G infrastructure under guidelines issued Wednesday, amid US pressure to shut out Chinese giant Huawei. The EU plan, which closely mirrors rules set out Tuesday by Britain allowing a limited role for Huawei, stops short of barring the company from the next-generation communications network designed for near-instantaneous data transfers. It leaves member states with the responsibility to ensure the safe rollout of 5G and warns them to screen operators carefully, saying security of the network will be critically important for the entire EU. The so-called ""toolbox"" outlined by the European Commission avoids naming Huawei and does not call for an outright ban on any supplier. But it urges countries to ""assess the risk profile of suppliers (and)... apply relevant restrictions for suppliers considered to be high risk"" accordingly, including shutting them out of ""key assets defined as critical and sensitive"". It also recommends EU states avoid ""major dependency on a single supplier"" and ""dependency on suppliers considered to be high risk"". The guidelines are the fruit of months of agonizing within the EU, which has struggled to find a middle way to balance Huawei's dominance in the 5G sector with the security concerns pressed by Washington. Any bans on Huawei will now ultimately be up to individual member states, but the commission's middle road recommendations give cover to European capitals to resist pleas from Washington. Huawei welcomed the guidelines, saying they would allow it to continue playing a role in Europe's 5G rollout. ""This non-biased and fact-based approach towards 5G security allows Europe to have a more secure and faster 5G network,"" the company said in a statement. ""Huawei has been present in Europe for almost 20 years and has a proven track record with regard to security. We will continue to work with European governments and industry to develop common standards to strengthen the security and reliability of the network."" Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for the single market, said the bloc would not target any company, stressing that the new system was based on ""objective criteria"". ""We in Europe accept everyone but we have rules – these rules are clear and exacting,"" he told reporters. 'No safe option' London's announcement on Tuesday of a limited role for Huawei infuriated Washington, which says the company cannot be trusted with such important infrastructure because it is too close to the Beijing government. Britain, like the EU, plans to exclude risky operators from ""sensitive"" locations such as nuclear sites and military bases, but US officials insist there was ""no safe option"" for Huawei to control any part of the network. The US has said the possibility of China using its commercial presence to spy on Britain – or even shut down the network – could force Washington to stop sharing intelligence with London. ""Our view of Huawei is putting it in your system creates real risk. This is an extension of the Chinese Communist Party with a legal requirement to hand over information to the Chinese Community Party,"" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday during a visit to London. ""We'll evaluate what the United Kingdom did.... But our view is we should have Western systems with Western rules and American information should only pass across a trusted network. We'll make sure we do that."" Huawei is widely viewed as providing the most advanced alternative for super-fast data transfers behind technologies such as self-driving cars and remotely operated factory robots. Along with European telecom companies Nokia and Ericsson, it is one of the few suppliers capable of building 5G networks. The commission warned that 5G will offer ""more potential entry points"" for cyber attacks – a growing threat as more and more critical services such as hospitals and power grids depend on data networks. ""5G will be a ground-breaking technology but it cannot come at the expense of the security of our internal market,"" commission vice-president Margaritis Schinas said in a statement. ""The toolbox is an important step in what must be a continuous effort in the EU's collective work to better protect our critical infrastructures."" Doubts about Huawei come amid a more general anxiety about Beijing's growing presence in the EU, where a growing number of countries in the east are opening the door to Chinese investment in infrastructure. With the job of vetting prospective 5G suppliers left to member states, there will be questions about whether all have the capacity or political willingness to carry out the job thoroughly, particularly if it might involve embarrassing a major partner such as China. – Rappler.com "

File photo by Iya Forbes/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Musicians Saab Magalona and Jim Bacarro shared the ""origin story"" of their superhero: their first born son Pancho. Pancho was born in February 2018. But because of complications, Saab and Jim lost Pancho's twin sister Luna. Since then, people have rallied behind Pancho as he healed and grew to become one of the internet's most beloved babies. In a new video shared on January 29, Saab told the story of Pancho's miraculous recovery in detail, over clips of Pancho through the years. Saab began by saying that after losing Luna, doctors performed emergency surgery on Pancho to try and save him – but advised his parents to say their goodbyes because he was unlikely to last the night. ""But like a superhero, Pancho fought,"" Saab said. In the weeks that followed, Pancho faced serious complications even as he was confined in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU): ventriculitis, pulmonary hypertension, sepsis, and intraventricular hemorrhage – a serious bleeding in the brain that damaged some of his brain matter. At just 17 days old, he underwent brain surgery, but was finally able to go home after a 58-day hospital stay. ""Like a superhero, Pancho is not like most kids,"" Saab said, sharing that he had to undergo another major brain surgery after a month of being home ""but Pancho handled it like a champ."" Saab shared that even when Pancho turned one, he wouldn't make eye contact or follow objects with his eyes. And while tests showed no problems with his eye structure, his doctors said his brain injury might have affected his vision and that he might be blind. ""Just as Jim and I were slowly trying to accept it, he suddenly followed a toy with his eyes. Then he started reaching for it,"" Saab said. As Saab went on, she shared how Pancho continued to surprise people. ""We were told he would have very limited motor skills, possibly not even being able to roll over, then he rolled over, and over, and over, and over, and over,"" she said, adding that he continues to show cognitive skills beyond expectations, even making some of his doctors cry. ""So when you see us, don't feel bad that we're going through a different path than most families,"" Saab said. ""Remember: he wasn't even supposed to make it through the night."" She ended the video by saying: ""In comic books, there are multiverses and different timelines. In another one, my baby girl might be alive and Pancho might be like every other almost-two-year-old. But then I wouldn't have gotten to know this Pancho of ours, the one who shows us that God is listening and showing us his miracles through him, the one who gives the sweetest hugs, the Pancho who, like a superhero, saved me and my husband."" ""We are happy – honored in fact – to be on this superhero's timeline,"" she said. The video ended with text reading ""In loving memory of Luna Isabel Magalona-Bacarro,"" leading in to a series of Thank Yous to members of Saab and Jim's families and household, Pancho's doctors, and to those who continue to pray for him.

The export credit agencies (ECAs) of G20 countries currently provide more than 10 times more state-backed finance to oil, gas and coal projects abroad than they do to renewable energy schemes, the analysis said. Under the Paris Agreement, emissions from these projects do not count as part of donor nations' carbon footprint. ECAs are public entities that provide government-backed loans and insurance to overseas businesses. Market monitor Oil Change International and Friends of the Earth America showed that G20 financing for coal delivered via ECAs under the Paris radar had increased as a percentage of energy project financing since the 2015 Paris treaty. That translates to $7.1 billion annually in the years since the signing of the landmark accord that enjoins nations to slash carbon emissions. ""It's reckless and reprehensible for any government to still be providing billions in public finance for oil, gas and coal,"" said Bronwen Tucker, an analyst at Oil Change. ""It's even more offensive when these fossil fuel handouts come from the governments who are most historically responsible for the climate crisis."" The analysis singled out China, Japan, South Korea and Canada as among the worst offenders, accounting for 78% of G20 fossil fuel support from 2016-2018. ""Despite the climate emergency, ECAs are doubling down on fossil fuels,"" it said. ""Japan's ECAs continue to support new coal projects; Canada's ECA is pouring money into tar sands, and many ECAs are jumping at the chance to support LNG in northern Mozambique and elsewhere."" The United Nations says carbon emissions must decline 7.6% annually by 2030 in order to put the world on track to meet the 1.5C temperature rise cap called for under Paris. Instead, fossil fuel emissions are rising annually as energy demand surges. ""ECAs are something almost no one has heard of but, as public finance institutions, they help governments pursue trade strategies and individual countries are able to shroud their investments around them,"" Tucker told Agence France-Presse (AFP). Guarantors She said that most ECA funding comes from public coffers. ""But they play a different role to private enterprise in terms of their creditworthiness."" They are ""backed by a government and their credit rating is much higher so the value of that guarantee is higher,"" Tucker added. AFP asked all export credit agencies named in the analysis for comment. The watchdogs highlighted the announcement last week from Britain that it was ending funding for overseas coal. Its ECA, UK Export Finance, has not funded a coal-fired power plant since 2002, but a separate analysis showed it is financing millions of tonnes worth of overseas emissions through continued oil and gas funding.

Although there were no confirmed cases of 2019-nCov in Aklan or the rest of the Philippines, for that matter – the indefinite suspension of classes was in effect in schools near the Governor Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center or Aklan Training Center in Barangay Old Buswang, about two kilometers from downtown Kalibo. The suspension of classes affected some 4,000 students of Starglow Center for Academics and Arts, Buswang Old Bakhaw Sur Elementary School, and Saint Gabriel College, which are within the 500-meter radius of the government training center. Classes at the Regional Science High School for Region VI, a stone’s throw away from training center, were also canceled as a precautionary measure. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) Some parents, with the safety of their children in mind, did not wait for an official announcement for class suspensions. The ""virus scare"" also prompted people to buy and wear face or surgical masks to protect them against the virus. On Thursday, January 29, Kalibo Mayor Emerson Lachica issued Executive Order No. 004 calling for the class suspensions to safeguard the health and safety of students, employees, and teachers. He issued the EO after the Provincial Health Office announced it was monitoring 11 Chinese visitors – 7 adults and 4 children – who were traced by health authorities in Boracay Island last week. They were admitted to the Aklan provincial hospital in Kalibo, on January 24 and transferred to the training center the next day for medical observation. Provincial Health Officer I Dr Cornelio Cuachon Jr said the tourists did not show flu-like symptoms after 4 of them had close contact with a patient positive for the 2019-nCoV in Hong Kong. The Chinese tourists, all from Hubei province, will stay in Aklan until February 3 or after going through the maximum 14-day incubation period. The 2019-nCoV has infected over 6,000 people and  led to 132 deaths in parts of the world, according to World Health Organization situation report on January 29. Of the number, China accounted for 5,997 cases and over 100 deaths. In the Philippines, 24 foreign tourists were being monitored after they showed flu-like symptoms and found to have a history of travel to Wuhan in Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak.

851,250575,"January 31, 2020",Thought Leaders,[ANALYSIS] My takeaway from the bushfires Down Under,Dennis Acop,"'Australians are quite divided on how to effectively deal with the recurrent bushfires'    As many have commented, it appears that 2020 is fast becoming a year of disasters. Not yet fully into the first month and the world is already touched by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, fires, floods, hailstorms, dust storms, a locust infestation, water turning red, an epidemic, potential wars, air crashes, and extreme weather conditions. In fact, just before the previous year ended, Australia began to experience the worst bushfires it has seen in decades burning across almost half its territory. This piece examines Australians’ insights into the bushfires, the fires’ impact on Australian daily life, and lessons that continue to be learned from the recurrent infernos. Bushfires in Australia are nothing new. That the recent fires have been intense and widespread caught the attention of the world, and so the unfamiliar thought they were something unusual. But they are not. Bushfires regularly occur especially during the summer months (Dec-Feb) from intense dry heat sweeping across the land. Traditional indigenous burning may also trigger fires. And many now believe that climate change has been exacerbating the problem. The recent bushfires, which impacted mostly the eastern half of the island continent, burned some 18.6 million hectares (46 million acres/186,000 square kilometers/72,000 square miles) of land, destroyed 5,900 buildings (including approximately 2,683 homes), killed at least 33 people, and annihilated an estimated 1 billion animals driving some endangered species into extinction. As local authorities put it: ""The nation’s loss is huge and beyond imagination!"" As of this writing, the bushfires have waned and disaster response is currently moving towards recovery, an equally daunting challenge which will take a long period of time to complete given the magnitude of lives and property impacted. The local councils have been and are the key not only in disaster response but in the long road to bushfire recovery. ""Response towards saving lives and property and minimizing impacts on infrastructure and the environment has been heroic,"" reported The West Australian. As in other places, Australians are quite divided on how to effectively deal with the recurrent bushfires even as they are united toward disaster prevention to the extent possible or mitigating disaster impact. Such division can be gleaned from the diverse reactions of individuals and groups across Australian society. For one, the strategists point out that there has not been enough collaboration between government and the private sector, rendering the attainment of climate change targets unfulfilled beyond commitment rhetoric. Even before the bushfires, a late 2019 survey of business CEOs in Australia revealed that two-thirds of them viewed climate change as a major threat. The recent bushfires have cemented their view. The global CEO survey released by audit firm PwC admitted that both economic and revenue growths are major hurdles for 2020 and probably years to come due to climate change. Government’s commitment to the Paris Accord is a 26%-28% carbon emissions reduction by 2030 from the 2005 level. ""The cost of inaction on climate change was clear in the bushfire relief package that had to be rolled out by Federal Government,"" said opposition Labor Leader Anthony Albanese. It must be understood that corporate growth translates into employee livelihood and benefit revenues as well as tax revenues that propel disaster response and recovery. For instance, a local councilor reported that recovery is ""cemented by a federal grant of $1M to bushfire affected councils with minimal red tape."" That is why government is also keen on reversing the past six-year deficit spending into a budget surplus. Meanwhile, there are also some members of society who are not fully convinced that climate change is a major threat exacerbating the bushfires. These locals would rather see the country improving on prevention strategies. Hugh Francis of Portland, Victoria wrote that Prime Minister Scott Morrison should not be influenced by the Greens, Labor, climate activists, and some media claiming that the latest bushfires and floods in the east coast are the results of climate change. He proposes instead that state and territory governments become realistic about hazard reduction. Moreover, Doug Hurst from Chapman, ACT added that man cannot control the complexities of climate whereby carbon dioxide is merely one minor part, insinuating that carbon emissions control is useless and a waste. Furthermore, John Bell (Heidelberg, Victoria) blasts climate change believers, accusing them of ideological opportunism in ""deliberately ignoring the data of worse fire disasters down through history."" On the other hand, Marianne Cannon of Brisbane, Queensland supports the view that ""climate change is well known as a risk multiplier for extreme weather, bushfires, and drought,"" and that ""the fires have woken many up to the harsh reality that is global climate change."" The Aboriginal people of Australia also had something to say about the bushfires. In fact, the fires gave them another opportunity to air their grievances against government attributing climate change to how their ex-colonizers have mistreated the land. Professor Alexis Wright, a member of the Waanyi nation, wrote in the New York Times that ""the best way to combat these destructive fires is to listen to those who have cared for the land the longest."" Expanding understanding of the bushfires as a global threat, Wright adds that ""in Australia, as well as in the Amazon rainforest, the Congo, and Northern California, blatant disregard for indigenous land management practices has contributed to the burning of the forests, the destruction of indigenous culture, and the deaths of many people and animals."" Australians have weathered the different natural calamities that had come their way through the years, bushfires included. As in every disaster that impacts any human habitat, the loss in life and property is always devastating. How much more if the magnitude of the disaster is as widespread and prolonged as the recent bushfires? Lives are interrupted, halted, and even ended. Fortunately, general response has been heroic with almost all sectors coming together to help led by the affected local councils. Many have volunteered to keep the fires at bay, thereby even risking their lives. Donations in cash and in kind have been pouring in from domestic and foreign donors. For instance, I am aware of donations and service support from the Business Council of Australia, Red Cross, Postal Service, cultural workers, and the Catholic Church, among many others. Fund raisings by just about anyone who can (e.g. Jetty’s Bar & Grill in South Yunderup, etc.) has not been uncommon. Vivek of Australia Post, who helped the Victoria State Emergency Service evacuate people and deliver critical supplies, had this to say: ""What really struck me was the resilience of the people who have banded together from all parts of life to help rebuild a fractured landscape. There is such positivity in the face of a national tragedy."" Volunteer firefighter Max added: ""We see so many people who have lost everything and we wonder how they’re going to move forward. They will need a lot of help. But we also see many people already helping each other and that’s very important. It doesn’t matter how much or little you do — it’s about being there for one another."" The next phase in this tragic journey is the long road to recovery. In this regard, local governments through the councils of affected communities will continue to spearhead recovery efforts as they had with disaster response. According to The West Australian, not only are the councils mandated, but that they are most familiar with the identities and needs of their constituencies. Recovery efforts are mammoth as they deal with almost every aspect of people’s lives and may take months or even years to manage through. The council staff themselves are already exhausted at this point, as many are victims themselves, have been battling the blazes as well, supporting emergency response agencies, and operating emergency relief centers on top of their day-to-day local government services. Local, State, and Federal governments will need to work together to rebuild entire communities ravaged by fires. The Prime Minister and the Federal Disaster and Emergency Management Minister have recognized the role played by the councils towards leading local communities along the road to recovery. By all accounts, resilience is already quite apparent if the initial actions from both the victims and all those helping them are indicators. Finally, what are the lessons learned moving forward? First, Australians have already agreed that controlling carbon gas emissions is a commitment towards mitigating widespread bushfire risk. They are just divided on how to achieve commitment targets. Labor government promised a 45% cut in emissions on 2005 levels by year 2030 as well as a budget surplus to reverse the past straight six-year deficit. But it will have to increase taxes to do so. On the other hand, PM Morrison is willing to spend for climate change related initiatives but not demand new taxes. His challenge: emissions reduction without increasing taxes via carbon tax, without higher electricity costs, and without wiping out important sectors of the economy depended upon by the nation. Secondly, a more effective collaboration between government and the private sector towards achieving committed emission reduction targets must be attained. The lack of effective collaboration between the two entities unlike those found in other countries has been acknowledged as a major flaw. The recent fires have cemented urgency to this needed reform. Thirdly, Australia may need to review its current disaster management policy given the now greater impact of bushfires and the near impossibility of stopping them and their spread once underway. And fourth, now may be the right time for Australia to finally allow substantive contribution from its first settlers — the Aboriginal people — regarding an issue that lies at the heart of still aggrieved native Australians — land. As Wright pointed out, ""Australia’s leaders need to recognize the depth and value of Aboriginal knowledge and incorporate (those) skills in hazard management."" More specifically, he proposes a national indigenous burning program wherein indigenous people lead land and hazard management in the country. – Rappler.com Col Dencio Acop (Ret), PhD, CPP, AMBCI is a West Point graduate (1983) who had served with the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

President Rodrigo Duterte and his Cabinet officials at the start of the 45th Cabinet Meeting in Malacañang Palace on January 6, 2020.

Panelo made the statement in a Palace news briefing, when asked if the President's ban on US trips for Cabinet members covered non-official trips as well. ""Oo 'wag na muna pumunta doon (Yes, let's not go there for now). We have to defer to the President's wishes,"" Panelo said. What ban? Duterte announced on Wednesday night, January 29, that no Cabinet member would be allowed to go to the US ""indefinitely,"" his latest move after threatening to scrap the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). The Philippine chief likened the move to a ""boycott,"" his next step in ""toning down"" bilateral ties with the country's oldest and most powerful ally, after the US government's cancellation of Senator Ronald dela Rosa's visa. Duterte vowed to ""terminate"" the Philippines-US VFA unless Washington ""corrects"" itself and restores Dela Rosa's visa. He claimed that his decision to terminate the two countries' military pact was also anchored on the US Senate's adoption of a resolution that seeks Global Magnitsky Act sanctions against Philippine officials involved in extrajudicial killings and the detention of Senator Leila de Lima. Dela Rosa, his first Philippine National Police, is the architect of Duterte's bloody and controversial war on illegal drugs criticized at home and abroad for leading to human rights abuses. The move to bar Cabinet members from travelling to America, Duterte added, was in line with his desire to ""slowly tone down"" the Philippines' bilateral relations with the US. Asked for details on what the President meant by this, Panelo told reporters he would first need to consult Duterte. Some exceptions: Panelo clarified that Duterte's ban did not cover Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. Locsin was coincidentally in the US when Duterte announced his decision to bar his Cabinet members from going there. Duterte had long expressed his dislike for the US, pushing for an ""independent foreign policy"" that has largely been characterized by a pivot from the Philippines' longtime ally to countries like China and Russia. Then-president Barrack Obama was among the first personalities that he cursed in public speeches for criticizing his war on drugs. – Rappler.com  "

Considered as the world's only herbivorous marine mammal, the dugong can grow up to 3 meters, weigh up to 500 kilograms and live for 70 years. Photo courtesy of C3 Philippines, Inc.  Scientists in the Philippines may have discovered an answer to one of marine conservation’s biggest questions: how can we design Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that both effectively conserve endangered ecosystems and respect the rights of established fishing communities? When nearly half of the world’s population relies on fish for 20% of their yearly protein intake, we need to develop strategies for designing MPAs that will sustainably support our fish consumption. And with the current climate crisis already putting so much pressure on terrestrial and marine ecosystems alike? Now more than ever, this marine protection crisis deserves attention. (READ: Rappler Talk: Alexandra Cousteau's stories on deep sea exploration and marine life) In the spring of 2018, this team of scientists decided to open an investigation into effective MPA design, using Sogod Bay in the Philippines as a case study. Based on the objectives of Aichi Target 11 (a United Nations strategy aiming to protect 10% of the global marine environment by 2020) they pinpointed two main priorities: minimize the impact of MPAs on local fishing communities, and protect the widest range of biodiversity possible within the proposed MPA boundaries. They drafted 3 plans using 3 different approaches, comparing them for overall effectiveness. The first approach allowed individual coastal communities to identify MPA’s that they would support. The resulting system of MPAs, however, did not protect a wide enough range of marine biodiversity, and it affected some fishing communities more severely than others. (READ: PH is marine hotspot: Verde Island Passage yields 100 new species) In the second approach, a national-scale conservation project selected the locations of MPAs, but this plan, while protecting a wider scope of marine biodiversity, also disproportionately affected fishing communities. The third and most successful approach, called the “systematic conservation planning approach,” involved a computer software called Marxan with Zones. Combining local input and biodiversity data using this software, the scientists were able to achieve all of their goals: the resulting network would meet Target 11’s biodiversity protection standards and minimally affect local fishing communities, removing only 16% of fishing grounds. The Achilles’ heel of this method may turn out to be how little it accounts for the particular patterns and life cycles of marine species within the proposed MPAs. As of yet, systematic planning technology only takes into account quantities of biodiversity without addressing the nuanced life histories of local marine species. However, the support and involvement of local communities might just make for the success of this design; a community involved in the design of an MPA is more likely to uphold its regulations, giving marine life within the MPA a chance to recover. The more recovery that occurs within well-regulated MPAs, the more likely it is that recovered populations will “spill over” or leave the reserve, replenishing fisheries in the surrounding area. Incorporating the input of local fishermen into MPA design should keep the peace as far as local response goes, but only time will tell if this network of MPAs will be as effective in protecting marine life as scientists hope. If this strategy is successful, it could revolutionize the design of MPAs everywhere, and contribute to the replenishment of depleted fisheries all over the world. – Rappler.com Sarah Hurlock studies conservation biology at Middlebury College.

Interior Secretary Eduardo Año says he and other members of the Cabinet will abide by President Rodrigo Duterte's order prohibiting them from traveling to the U.S. File photo by Darren Langit/Rappler MANILA, Philippines –  Members of President Rodrigo Duterte’s Cabinet will abide by his order prohibiting them from traveling to the US, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año told reporters on Thursday, January 30. This came a day after Duterte said he would “indefinitely” not allow any Cabinet member to go to the US as he “tones down” the Philippines’ relations with its traditional ally. “If we are probably sick and seeking medical treatment, I think those are exemptions, but, for now, we will abide by the direction, instruction of the President,” Año told reporters on the sidelines of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines’ yearly “Prospects” forum in Makati City. “Anyway, I don’t have plans of going to the United States because I have to take care of a lot of things here,” Año added. Duterte’s order followed an earlier announcement that he would terminate the Philippines’ Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the US, which in turn followed the revocation of Senator Ronald dela Rosa’s US visa. The US Senate earlier adopted a resolution that seeks Global Magnitsky Act sanctions against Philippine officials involved in extrajudicial killings in Duterte’s “war on drugs” and the unlawful detention of Senator Leila de Lima. Dela Rosa appears to be the first Philippine official whose US visa was cancelled because of this. Año said his US visa remains valid, and that he did not know of any other official besides Dela Rosa whose US visa had been revoked. As the first police chief under Duterte, Dela Rosa was the architect of the drug war that saw more than 5,000 people killed, according to government figures, but which rights groups estimate to be at least 27,000. Duterte said his order to call off the VFA, a pact that allows for US military presence in the Philippines, was not a mere reaction to Dela Rosa’s visa getting cancelled, but to the US Senate resolution, and to a provision in the US 2020 national budget that similarly sanctions De LIma’s accusers. If Washington's sanctions are imposed, affected Philippine officials may be denied US visas and have their bank accounts and assets in the US frozen. Duterte has faced opposition and criticism for putting the VFA on the line over his administration’s tussles with the US, and reporters asked Año whether he finds this reason enough to prohibit even members of the Cabinet from traveling to the US. “Well, that’s the instruction of the President, and, as a member of his Cabinet, his family, we have to abide, and we have to set aside our personal opinions and reasons,” Año replied. He said he expected the Office of the President to produce a document defining the coverage of the travel prohibition, and that it would be discussed in the next Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, February 4. – Rappler.com "

Quiboloy. They are into this grand conspiracy to put to shame PACQ,” he said. Torreon said that there are more than two former KJC members who have been trying to put Quiboloy down on trumped-up charges. He said the former members are making these allegation after Quiboloy ordered financial audits on some of his officials. Torreon said what was saddening to Quiboloy was that these persons – whom he did not name – were “close to him.” A report by ABS-CBN News quoted Laura Eimillier of the FBI as saying:  The 3 arrested ""are forcing these individuals, in some cases, to work all day, solicit funds, for what they are saying for impoverished children in the Philippines. In reality, we believe the money is going to fund the lavish lifestyles of the leaders of this scheme."" The fresh allegation against Quiboloy came after a former member accused him of rape and trafficking. In December, Blenda Portugal accused Quiboloy and 5 others – Jackielyn Roy, Cresente Canada, Pauline Canada, Ingrid Ca­nada, and Sylvia Cemañes – of sexual abuse and forced labor. In 2019, the FBI agents in Hawaii also started investigating Quiboloy's church for alleged human trafficking. – Rappler.com "

Samsung's launching a new foldable called the Z Flip, according to rumor, with a new leak from Evan Blass showing the purported device. Photo from Evan Blass/Twitter MANILA, Philippines – Samsung is once again gearing up to unveil its new line of flagship devices in the first of its annual Unpacked events scheduled for February 11 in San Francisco, California. The South Korean tech giant is said to be doing away with its old naming standards and will be calling the successor to its Galaxy S10 line, Galaxy S20, instead of Galaxy S11. The line is expected to feature three flagship phones: the Galaxy S20, the Galaxy S20+, and the Galaxy S20 Ultra. Here’s everything we know so far: Display and design  UNPACKED. Samsung will have a new event on February 11. Screenshot from Vimeo video. From MySmartPrice, Samsung’s latest line of flagships will reportedly boast bigger AMOLED screens than their predecessors. The S20, for instance, will sport a 6.2-inch screen, which is an inch bigger than the S10’s 6.1-inch screen. Meanwhile, the S20+ will have a 6.7-inch screen, which is about the same size as the S10 5G model’s screen and, of course, bigger than the 6.4-inch screen of the S10+. The biggest among the three is the S20 Ultra, which will reportedly come with a whopping 6.9-inch screen. To put it to scale, last year’s Note 10+ – a device that falls into the so-called phablet category – only has a 6.8-inch screen. According to a different leak from XDA Developers, the display of all three models will feature an option to toggle 120Hz refresh rate, allowing certain actions such as scrolling, for example, to look and feel smoother. The caveat is that the faster refresh rate will only be available for the lower FHD+ screen resolution and not with the maximum WQHD+. Design-wise, all 3 models will not look all that different from their predecessors, flaunting the company’s familiar Infinity-O display, which features a 20:9 aspect ratio and a hole-punch notch placed at the top center of the screen. Cameras The S20 will come with a triple rear camera setup, which consists of a 12MP main camera, a 64MP telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera. It supports 3x optical zoom and up to 30x digital zoom, as well as the ability to record 8K resolution videos in 30fps. Up front, the phone will come with a 10MP selfie camera that can record 4K videos in 60fps. The S20+ will have all the same cameras with the addition of a rear 3D time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensor that can enhance photography and augmented reality features. SUPPOSED APPEARANCE? Leaks from Evan Blass show the various variants of the S20 line. Photo from Evan Blass/Twitter SUPPOSED APPEARANCE? Leaks from Evan Blass show the various variants of the S20 line. Photo from Evan Blass/Twitter The biggest upgrade in the camera department will be seen in the S20 Ultra, which is expected to feature a quad rear camera setup made up of a 108MP main camera, a 48MP telephoto camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, and a 3D ToF sensor.  It will support 10x optical zoom and up to 100x digital zoom, as well as record 8K resolution videos in 30fps. The S20 Ultra also touts a 40MP front-facing wide camera that can record 4K videos in 60fps. Specs Depending on the region, all 3 models will be powered by either an in-house Exynos 990 or Snapdragon 865 chipset. Samsung will reportedly offer both 4G and 5G variants for the S20 and S20+ in markets outside of the US. While the chipsets in the phones don’t have integrated 5G support, the 5G variants are expected to be paired with the proper modems to give them these capabilities. The S20 and S20+ will have 128GB of storage, which can be expanded with MicroSD for up 1TB, while the S20 Ultra will have 512GB and 128GB storage options. When it comes to battery capacity, the S20 Ultra will remain superior, housing a 5,000mAh. Behind it is the S20+ with a 4,500mAh battery while the S20 comes last with 4,000mAh. All 3 devices will ship running Android 10 out of the box with the company’s One UI 2.0 skin. Also worth pointing out is that none of the devices will come with a 3.5mm headphone jack. Price With the absence of an S10E equivalent,, the base S20 model will be the cheapest among the new releases with a rumored starting price of $850, or roughly P43,376. The S20 Plus, meanwhile, will reportedly cost $950, or about P48,479. Lastly, the S20 Ultra will break the $1,000 mark with a rumored starting price of $1,200, or P61,237. Galaxy Z Flip There have also been a lot of rumors that Samsung will pull the curtains back on a new foldable phone at the event – the Galaxy Z Flip. Going by the renders leaked by German site WinFuture, the follow-up to the Galaxy Fold will have a new clamshell design that folds into the shape of a square rather than a rectangle. It has two displays: a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with 22:9 aspect ratio when unfolded and an external 1.06-inch panel beside the dual rear cameras. The most interesting news coming from the leak, however, is that Samsung will use a new “Ultra Thin Glass” protection for the screen, which supposedly provides better protection than the film they used for the Galaxy Fold. For the phone’s specs, it will house a Snapdragon 855+, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a 3,300mAh battery. The Galaxy Z Flip will reportedly sell for €1,500, or roughly P84,181. – Rappler.com  €1 = P56.12$1 = P51.03 "
862,250586,"February 02, 2020",NBA,Top life lessons Kobe Bryant taught us,Beatrice Go,"More than being an NBA great, Kobe Bryant teaches us how to overcome life's greatest hurdles    MANILA, Philippines – Kobe Bryant may have thrilled basketball fans with his sharpshooting skills and high-flying dunks, but the Los Angeles Lakers superstar also made an impact around the world with his Mamba Mentality mantra. The five-time NBA champion, also known as the ""Black Mamba,"" broke records and inspired many to rise amid struggles as he also fought through multiple injuries, adversities, and scandals in his 20-year NBA career. That's why the tragic death of Kobe, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and 7 others, plunged the world into mourning, proving that his influence goes beyond the sporting world. Here are just some of the lessons that Kobe's life has taught us: Not giving up ""My brain... it cannot process failure. It will not process failure. Because if I sit there and have to face myself and tell myself, ‘You’re a failure’... I think that’s almost worse than death."" The main premise of Mamba Mentality is how to power through the most challenging times of your life. Kobe sustained plenty of injuries – from his wrists to his shoulders and ankles – in his 20 years of playing in the NBA. But what made people believe in the impossible is how he played through them until his retirement in 2016. One of the most iconic moments of Kobe's sheer grit was when he tore his Achilles in a 2013 game against the Golden State Warriors, but still managed to trudge to the free throw line and make both charities before exiting the game. A hard worker all his life, Kobe constantly showcased his winning mentality and led the Lakers to a three-peat from 2000 to 2002 and back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010.  This is the stuff I think about when I think about Kobe Bryant on a basketball court. Hitting two free throws with a torn Achilles in a regular season game because his team was down a bucket and they needed him. Lakers won by two. Talents like this stay with us forever. pic.twitter.com/jH3hUzE8af  Facing fear and pressure ""Everything negative – pressure, challenges – is all an opportunity for me to rise."" Many of us have gone through times where we feel scared of taking risks and failing, but Kobe had always been brave enough to push himself harder until he achieved his desired results. Yet even after clinching titles and breaking NBA records, Kobe would not be satisfied and always strived to become better than he was, no matter the criticisms and limitations – a disposition that made him a true league icon. Staying motivated ""I can’t relate to lazy people. We don’t speak the same language. I don’t understand you. I don’t want to understand you."" Kobe's trademark includes an insane work ethic that's fueled by his eternal desire to continue improving himself. Some stories go way back to when he was in high school, with accounts from his coaches and teammates remembering how Kobe would start training at dawn and practice for more than 6 hours in the morning. Even during the off-season, Kobe's workout included 2 hours of track, 2 hours of basketball and 2 hours of cardio or weightlifting. Not to mention the suicide push-ups, where he launches himself from the mat and slaps his pecs. Aside from sticking to his grueling schedule, Kobe would also immerse himself in hours of film study before games and live a life without sugar and pizza as part of his strict diet. Being a leader ""The topic of leadership is a touchy one. A lot of leaders fail because they don’t have the bravery to touch that nerve or strike that chord. Throughout my years, I haven’t had that fear."" For the incredible talent that he has, it is no question that Kobe is the default leader of the Los Angeles Lakers during his career. The 18-time NBA All-Star became the youngest NBA player at 34 years and 104 days old to eclipse 30,000 career points in 2013 and was the Lakers' all-time leading scorer in February 2010. In 2006, he hit his career high of 81 points against the Toronto Raptors, which reamains as the second-highest number of points scored in a single game behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point performance. Until his NBA swan song in 2016, Kobe dropped 60 points against the Utah Jazz to close out his career. After his basketball retirement, the Lakers great led various business ventures such as the Mamba Sports Academy and projects in other industries like his short film Dear Basketball, which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2018. Role model parenting ""Use your success, wealth and influence to put them in the best position to realize their own dreams and find their true purpose. Put them through school, set them up with job interviews and help them become leaders in their own right. Hold them to the same level of hard work and dedication that it took for you to get to where you are now, and where you will eventually go."" Kobe was also a winner in his family as he dearly loved his wife Vanessa and 4 daughters – Natalia, Gianna, Bianka and Capri. Two daughters pursued a sporting career as the eldest Natalia, 17, sees action as a volleyball middle blocker, while the 13-year-old Gianna had hoped to follow her father's footsteps as a basketball superstar.  Our eldest but always our baby, Natalia  @mambavolleyball #middleblocker A post shared by  Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) on Jan 5, 2020 at 6:14pm PST Also known as ""Mambacita"" for her playing style and talent akin to Kobe's, Gianna was also personally trained by her dad and the NBA legend started watching games live regularly again to immerse Gianna into the big stage.  Happy 13th birthday my Gigi! I love you beyond measure baby #teen #daddysgirl #tauro #mambacita A post shared by  Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) on May 1, 2019 at 2:38pm PDT Kobe was proud of being a ""girl dad"" and ESPN broadcaster Elle Duncan even shared a touching encounter that had her tearing up on air. ""He immediately commented on my rather large eight-month pregnant belly. ‘How are you? How close are you? What are you having?’"" started Duncan. ""‘A girl,’ I said, and then he high-fived me."" ""‘Girls are the best.’ I asked him for advice on raising girls, seeing as he had 3 at the time. He said, ‘Just be grateful that you are being given that gift because girls are amazing.’"" ""And he said that his wife Vanessa wanted to try again for a boy, but was jokingly concerned it would be a girl."" ""I was like, ‘4 girls, are you joking? What would you think, how would you feel?’ And without hesitation, he said, ‘I would have 5 more girls if I could. I’m a girl dad.’"" Owning up to mistakes and moving forward ""I’m reflective only in the sense that I learn to move forward. I reflect with a purpose."" Kobe wasn't perfect. His decorated career was also marred with scandals and issues which were controversially highlighted by Washington Post reporter Felicia Sonmez as her tweets brought up Kobe's 2003 rape case hours after his death. Back then, the late Lakers star admitted to committing adultery and apologized to his victim as he thought that the sex was consensual. Kobe also had a longtime feud with former Lakers teammate Shaquille O'Neal despite winning 3 championships together. But over the years, both superstars managed to mend their friendship and develop mutual respect. Loving the game ""The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do."" Kobe was a hero to many, emulated even by today's most outstanding NBA players. But beyond his on-court achievements, he showed real passion for the sport by investing time in coaching and developing youth programs. A staunch supporter of women's sports and the WNBA, Kobe also imagined his daughter Gianna joining the ranks of great sportswomen like Sue Bird and Megan Rapinoe.

This photo taken on May 27, 2010, shows Chinese workers in the Foxconn factory in Shenzhen. File photo by AFP LONDON, United Kingdom – From carmaking to electronics and tourism, the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China is infecting companies around the world with anxiety about the impact on their supplies and earnings. As authorities adopt drastic steps to contain the deadly virus, foreign businesses are braced for further disruption next month after the Lunar New Year holidays, which for now have shuttered most factories and offices in China. Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn said Wednesday, January 29, it would keep its Chinese factories closed until mid-February and will allow local employees to delay their return after the new year break. The move could affect global supply chains for tech companies that rely on Foxconn to manufacture everything from Apple's iPhones to flat-screen TVs and laptops. Chinese tour groups are banned from heading overseas meanwhile, promoting jitters among foreign luxury brands and high-end retail hubs such as Paris and Milan. Airlines have slashed flights to China. British Airways and Lufthansa have stopped flying there altogether. Iris Pang, China economist at ING, forecast global tourism numbers could plummet by 30% this year from last due to the outbreak, which has spread out of China to the rest of Asia, Europe, and North America. In China itself, Pang said, year-on-year retail sales growth could halve to 3% to 4%, possibly imperiling the government's promises to import more US goods under a recent deal aimed at ending a protracted trade war. 'Negative feedback loop' ""It is not necessarily the virus per se that is the problem for the world's economy,"" commented Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia at OANDA in Singapore, after days of selloffs on stock markets in Asia, Europe, and the United States. ""It is the self-feeding negative feedback loop on economic activity, and thus growth, it creates,"" he said, warning that a months-long crisis could even force the Federal Reserve to shift tack on US interest rates. The extended holiday in China means the immediate impact on industrial production is limited for now. Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak in central China, is a hub for US, European, and Japanese carmakers, and electronics suppliers. But now foreign countries are organizing evacuation flights for their nationals out of the city. And with China imposing quarantines on millions of people in several cities beyond Wuhan itself, while prolonging the break for a week beyond its scheduled finish on January 30, ripple effects for companies are inevitable. Apple itself on Tuesday, January 28, gave an unusually wide revenue forecast for this quarter, due to uncertainty about how the outbreak will affect its business. Chief executive Tim Cook said Apple was working on ""mitigation plans"" to make up for any production loss from its suppliers in China, such as Foxconn, which accounts for the most US-bound exports by volume from Hubei province. Coffee and cars Another emblematic US brand, Starbucks, declined to offer further earnings guidance after posting its quarterly results, citing ""the dynamic situation unfolding with the coronavirus."" Mainland China is Starbucks' second biggest market, with more than 4,000 outlets, and half of them have been closed by the outbreak. After Starbucks, the fast-food chains McDonald's and Domino's are most exposed among US brands as a percentage of their global revenues, according to Guggenheim analyst Matthew DiFrisco. Prolonged disruption will affect an array of other sectors. China is the leading producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are repackaged by Western drugs companies into many life-saving treatments. In the immediate firing line around Wuhan are General Motors, PSA, Renault, Nissan, and Honda, who have all adopted the city as a base for joint carmaking ventures. Each says it is monitoring the situation closely, while Toyota is suspending production in China until at least February 9 given the likely disruption not just for its own staff but to parts suppliers around the country. Another automaker tracking the situation is entrepreneur Elon Musk's electric car firm Tesla, which has only just started to roll out Model 3 sedans from a new ""giga-factory"" in Shanghai, its first plant outside the United States. ""Investors are already showing signs of nervousness over this health crisis and its broader economic impacts, which will potentially be felt well beyond China, which is a vital source of global automotive industry profitability,"" according to David Leggett, automotive editor at GlobalData. – Rappler.com  "

She enumerated the achievements of her office's Angat Buhay program, which is funded through corporate and organizational partnerships to make up for the relatively small portion that the Office of the Vice President receives from the national budget. Robredo highlighted her office's housing project for people displaced by the 2017 siege of Marawi City by the Maute terror group – and criticized the Duterte administration for failing to spend some P400 million in funds allocated for Marawi's recovery in 2018, which reverted to the national treasury. Truth-tellers ""Information on things like the Marawi projects, the supply of drugs in the country, the real state of the economy, allow citizens to make better decisions, whether in politics or in business. An open government that allows the media, civil society, and any concerned citizen to speak out and call it out, ensures that the government remains accountable to the people it serves,"" said Robredo, who had served as the country's drug czar in late 2019, when Duterte offered her the job and then fired her after 18 days. After her brief stint as drug czar, Robredo reported that the ""war on drugs"" has been a failure, having seized only 1% of the total supply of illegal drugs in the Philippines. For this, Duterte called her a ""colossal blunder."" In the forum, Robredo asked journalists to ""work together"" with her by continuing to report the truth – especially on drug war killings – to dispel the misconceptions and misinformation that drive people into supporting authoritarian rule. ""I cannot overemphasize the crucial role that the media can play in this. You have the power to be truth-tellers.

In separate statements, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto, senators Risa Hontiveros, Joel Villanueva, and Christopher ""Bong"" Go supported the call. Hontiveros proposed a temporary travel ban of at least 30 days on all individuals traveling from China, as well as travellers who passed through China within the past two weeks.  (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) ""Our travel ban must firmly include both air and sea travel to prevent a local outbreak. This includes a temporary ban on all cruise ships from docking at any of our ports,"" Hontiveros said. Recto questioned why the Philippines has yet to implement a travel ban, saying that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, had already announced plans to slash cross-border travel. ""I think it is time to put a temporary 'Do not enter sign' on our doorstep for visitors from China. Let us explain to them that we are not permanently closing our doors. This is not a permanent Great Wall. This is only during the duration of the coronavirus crisis,"" Recto said.

Kung sakali, pabor ako diyan para maiwasan po itong pagkalat. (Let's wait for their recommendation.

For those already in quaratined areas in China, Villanueva said: ""Please follow the health protocol being observed in the area. Help our diplomatic staff there by notifying your status so that every Filipino is accounted for."" Villanueva also urged the Department of Labor and Employment to issue a labor advisory that would remind private companies of their obligations with labor standards, particulary the Occupational Safety and Health Standards law. ""Our labor officials should seize the moment to reiterate that the health and safety of our workers must be of paramount concern to employers. Our OSHS law states this principal clearly and unequivocally,"" Villanueva said.

The patient is a 38-year-old woman who traveled from Wuhan, China, the ground zero of the outbreak, via Hong Kong, on January 21. The virus has claimed 170 lives in China and infected thousands of people in that country alone.  Travel to and from Wuhan had been restricted, as the government halted the issuance of visas to travelers from Hubei province.

Sofia Kenin defies expectations yet again. Photo by Greg Wood/AFP  MELBOURNE, Australia – Feisty American 14th seed Sofia Kenin stunned world No. 1 and home hope Ashleigh Barty to reach her first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open on Thursday, January 30. Kenin pulled off a surprise 7-6 (8/6), 7-5 victory to arrange a title showdown versus Garbine Muguruza, the unseeded former world number one who battled into her first Australian Open final after fighting back in both sets to defeat 4th seed Simona Halep 7-6 (10/8), 7-5 Moscow-born Kenin, 21, who looked shocked in the immediate aftermath, said: ""She's such a tough player, she's playing really amazing. I knew I had to really find a way to win. ""I'm just speechless, I honestly can't believe this. I've dreamed about this moment since I was 5 years old."" ""I've worked so hard to get here,"" added Kenin. ""I really had to fight out here. There's a reason she's No. 1."" Kenin, the last American left in a sweltering Melbourne, where play on the outside courts was suspended as temperatures hit 38 Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit), was the party pooper once more. She had already brought the fairytale run of 15-year-old Coco Gauff to an end in the fourth round with the aggressive style of play that has become her trademark over the past fortnight. And she was at it again as temperatures soared at a fiercely pro-Barty Rod Laver Arena. Both players retreated into the shade on court whenever they could. Kenin, who had a breakthrough 2019, winning her first 3 WTA titles, was contesting her first Grand Slam semifinal, and it was Barty's first time in the last four in Melbourne. But if the locals hoped Kenin would be cowed by the occasion and her top-ranked opponent, the French Open champion, they were mistaken. Barty and Kenin, wearing identical mint-green tops and blue skirts, went with serve in the 1st set, although the Australian was slightly more comfortable in doing so. There was again little between them in the tiebreak, until Barty unleashed a delicious cross-court forehand for two set points. But Barty, who once gave up tennis to play professional cricket, wasted both and they were level at 6-6. Kenin, a fiercely proud American with a stars-and-stripes racket, went 7-6 up and wrapped the set up in 59 minutes when Barty made an unforced error on a forehand. Barty, aiming to become the first home-grown Australian Open women's champion since Chris O'Neil in 1978, showed a rare flash of anger. The Australian went a break up early in the 2nd set to wrestle back the initiative, then held serve for 3-1. It was Kenin's turn to show her frustration. But Barty again squandered two set points, and was broken when she missed a routine forehand. Gasps and then a hush descended on Rod Laver Arena. Serving to stay in the tournament at 5-6, Barty saved the first match point, but folded under the pressure when she planted a forehand long.   Muguruza is unseeded at a Grand Slam for the first time since 2014 after her ranking slipped to 36 at the end of a poor 2019 by her high standards. That meant a tricky path to the final in Melbourne, where temperatures soared close to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Thursday. ""It's difficult, you never know who you're going to face right away, not being seeded,"" said the two-time Grand Slam winner. ""I knew whatever match, it was going to be tough, even how I started the tournament not feeling well. ""I'm happy to not be in the spotlight, it's good."" Muguruza was hindered by a viral illness in her tournament opener and lost the first set 6-0 to American qualifier Shelby Rogers. But she recovered her form and fitness to beat 3 top-10 seeds on her run to the final. Muguruza, who was restrained in her celebrations, is the first unseeded player to reach the Melbourne women's final since Belgium's Justine Henin in 2010. Muguruza and Halep, two former French Open and Wimbledon champions, were too close to split in a nervy 1st set at a steamy Rod Laver Arena. Muguruza squandered two set points in the tiebreak while saving two more for Halep, and then clinched it with a stop volley that the Romanian couldn't get back over the net. It was the 1st set that Halep – also a former No. 1 – had dropped all week and she reacted by mangling her racket and slumped in her chair, shaking her head. The 28-year-old recovered her poise and broke Muguruza for a 3-2 lead in the second set, before Muguruza broke back and then held to make it 6-5. Halep, so serene in Melbourne up until now, cracked as she served to stay in the tournament, netting a backhand as Muguruza surged forward on the second match point. – Rappler.com   "
876,250601,"January 30, 2020",Business,Virus crisis adds pressure on slowing Chinese economy,Agence France-Presse,"The novel coronavirus outbreak is expected to deliver a fresh blow to the world's No. 2 economy  SLOWING ECONOMY. A customer buys dried sausages at a market in Beijing on January 15, 2020. Photo by Nicolas Asfouri/AFP BEIJING, China – Cinemas empty, high-speed train trips canceled, tourist sites closed, an entire province shut down: The extraordinary measures taken by China to contain a deadly coronavirus threaten to dent an already fragile economy. With the world's No. 2 economy increasingly reliant on its consumers to drive growth, the virus has struck at the worst possible time with hundreds of millions of people fanned out across the country for the Lunar New Year holiday. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at its slowest pace in 3 decades last year, hit by weak domestic demand and the trade war with the United States. Still, figures in the final 3 months pointed to some stability and the recently signed trade pact with the US had provided further hope. But Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said there wasn't ""any doubt"" the coronavirus outbreak – which has killed more than 100 people – would deliver a fresh blow, warning that transport and broader consumption would be hit, including dining and retail. The holiday has been extended by 3 days, meaning the country may slowly get back to business only from Monday, February 3. Some companies told employees to work from home or stay away, including tech giant Tencent, which told staff to work at home until February 10. Popular restaurant chain Haidilao will close all its restaurants in China until the end of the month. The government has canceled domestic and international group tours, a move that could have a serious impact on its tourism sector – a crucial industry worth 11% of the country's total GDP. Authorities on Tuesday, January 28, recommended that all Chinese travelers put their trips abroad on hold ""in order to protect the health and safety of Chinese and foreign people"" – bad news for the country's airline industry. Threat to industry Railway volume and air traffic on the first day of the Lunar New Year were both down more than 40% on last year, according to the deputy transport minister. More than 2,000 high-speed trains – a popular mode of transportation in the vast country – have been suspended for days or weeks. Another growing sector – the film industry – has also taken a hit. China's box-office earnings for Lunar New Year's Eve were just one-tenth of last year as people shunned cinema crowds, and 7 key blockbusters set to be released during the holiday were canceled. Analysts at S&P say consumption contributed about 3.5 percentage points of China's growth rate in 2019, and warn that even a 10% drop in consumption would knock about 1.2 percentage points off GDP. Stephen Innes, of AxiCorp, said it would not be until after the holiday that ""the true extent of the carnage would be more evident."" The shutdown has been most serious in central Hubei province – the epicenter of the virus – where train stations have been closed, events canceled, and theaters, libraries, and karaoke bars shut in some locations. But beyond consumption and transport, the closure could have longer-term impacts to industry. Hubei's capital, Wuhan, a major manufacturing hub of 11 million people that produces steel and cars, has been placed under indefinite quarantine since Thursday, January 23. (READ: China virus injects fears for global supply chains) ""Wuhan is an important hub and manufacturing center in central China. If the lockdown continues after the Lunar New Year holidays, it will affect industrial production, one of the key growth drivers,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at ANZ Research. 'Complicated supply chains' Wuhan accounts for about 1.6% of China's GDP, according to S&P. Some 160 Japanese companies have offices in the city, according to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Wuhan. Several foreign carmakers, including General Motors and Renault, produce vehicles in the city through joint ventures with Chinese companies. The output value of the automobile and parts industry in Wuhan was around 400 billion yuan ($57 billion), according to a report in the Changliang Daily. The city was predicted to have produced around 1.7 million vehicles in 2018, it said. ""Complicated supply chains and just-in-time production could mean that production outages in Wuhan factories have broader spillover effects,"" S&P warned in a research note. The outbreak is inevitably drawing comparisons to the 2003 SARS epidemic, which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong. Evans-Pritchard warned that the new virus faces spreading wider and faster than SARS, pointing out that overseas travel has risen tenfold and passenger traffic has more than tripled in the past 17 years. During SARS, he said, passenger traffic halved, as did growth in the space of a few months. But ANZ's Yeung said the government had learned lessons on how to handle an epidemic and therefore the ""impact should be less severe"" than during SARS. Oxford Economics said in a note that the outbreak could potentially be ""a high impact, but short-lived event,"" mostly forming a risk in the first two quarters. – Rappler.com "

Novak Djokovic says he knows that the hurting Roger Federer was 'not even close to his best.' Photo by David Gray/AFP  MELBOURNE, Australia – Novak Djokovic shattered the hopes of ailing rival Roger Federer Thursday, January 30 to sweep into a record eighth Australian Open final and move closer to his 17th Grand Slam crown. In the 50th installment of one of sport's greatest rivalries, the Serb shrugged off a tentative start to reinforce his recent dominance, showing no mercy to the Swiss maestro in a 7-6 (7/1), 6-4, 6-3 win. He will play either 5th seed Dominic Thiem or 7th-ranked German Alexander Zverev in Sunday's final, but it will take a monumental effort to prize another title from the 32-year-old. Of the 7 Melbourne finals Djokovic has made, he has won them all. If any extra motivation was needed, winning on Sunday will see the Serb reclaim the No. 1 ranking after Rafael Nadal was sent packing in the last eight. ""Respect to Roger for coming out tonight when he was obviously hurt and not even close to his best in terms of movement,"" said defending champion Djokovic, who is into his 26th Grand Slam final. ""He started well at the beginning and I was pretty nervous. It was very important for me to win that first set. Mentally I relaxed after that."" It was the fourth time Djokovic had beaten Federer at the semifinal stage in Melbourne after doing the same in 2008, 2011 and 2016. Federer, the 2018 champion, came into the match carrying a groin injury that he picked up in his five-set, come-from-behind quarterfinal win against Tennys Sandgren. He was seen around Melbourne Park before the match with tape on his upper right leg and there were even rumors that he might pull out. But that is not in the 38-year-old's nature – he has only ever given up 4 walkovers in his long career – and the show was on. Power and finesse Djokovic was clear favorite after beating the 3rd seed in every Grand Slam meeting since Wimbledon 2012, but in their 50th career clash it was Federer who initially set Rod Laver Arena alight. The opening game, on Federer's serve, lasted 6 minutes in an indication of what might be in store. Then against the odds the 38-year-old, the oldest man in a Grand Slam semi since Jimmy Connors in 1991, broke Djokovic on his first service game with an unbelievable backhand passing shot. The edge didn't last long with the Serb immediately hitting back to even it up. But the power and finesse of the Federer game was troubling Djokovic, who was on the back foot and was broken once more to go 4-1 behind. Federer had 3 break points to make it 5-1, but Djokovic dug deep to fend them off as he clawed back, breaking once more as the Swiss was serving for the set. It went to a tiebreaker which the 2nd seed dominated to pull off a remarkable turnaround in a set that Federer threw away. Federer took a medical time at the end of it, apparently for a back issue, and he wasn't moving as freely in the 2nd set. But he clung on until he fluffed an easy shot at the net to hand Djokovic set point at 4-5 and the Serb cracked a top-quality crosscourt volley to go two sets to one in front. Djokovic was pumped and Federer rapidly running out of steam. When the Swiss star was broken to go 4-2 behind in the third, there was no way back as his rival extended his winning record over him to 27-23. – Rappler.com  "

File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The government's economic managers are confident that the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare would have a minimal impact on Philippine growth. Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III downplayed the possible effects of the 2019-nCov on the economy, saying that the Philippines has not been widely affected by the virus. (READ: Philippines confirms 1st case of novel coronavirus) ""We are a big enough economy that can handle this thing. We are not going into recession because of it,"" Dominguez said. Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia, meanwhile, said the effect on tourism would be ""short-term."" The Philippines has so far suspended visa upon arrival for Chinese tourists and businessmen, and temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from the Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, is in Hubei. There are strong calls to impose a temporary ban on all travel to and from China. While the Philippine officials said the health scare would not make much of a dent in the economy internally, they acknowledged that it could be among the external factors that may affect growth in the medium term. The economic team, composed of Dominguez, Pernia, and Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, met on Thursday to discuss the country's economic performance and to ""forge a strategy"" to achieve the gross domestic product (GDP) growth target of 6.5% to 7.5% in 2020. Aside from the 2019-nCov, the economic team identified the slowdown in global economic growth, lackluster recovery in trade, protectionist policies, and volatile oil prices, among others, as possible primary downside risks externally. On the domestic front, the economic team said natural hazards, African swine fever, water supply disruptions, slow implementation of infrastructure projects, and policy ""uncertainties"" – such as the delayed passage of tax reform packages – could hinder the economic growth trajectory in the medium term. They also said that the implementation of the Supreme Court ruling increasing local government units' share of national taxes may hinder growth, citing inefficient spending by LGUs. Because of the risks, Dominguez said infrastructure agencies should accelerate the implementation of priority projects. He added that the agriculture sector should grow at least 2% annually. In 2019, agriculture posted the slowest growth among major sectors at 1.5%. Digital trade, speeding up the rollout of the 3rd major telecommunications player, and addressing regulatory issues in the e-commerce industry, among others, were seen as part of strategies to address the risks to economic growth. The Philippines missed its GDP growth target in 2019, growing by 5.9% – the slowest in 8 years. The economic team largely attributed that to the delayed passage of the national budget, which had stalled infrastructure projects. – Rappler.com "

File photo of French Cardinal Philippe Barbarin (right), the former Archbishop of Lyon. Photo by Jeff Pachoud LYON, France – Appeals judges on Thursday, January 31, overturned a French cardinal's conviction for failing to report alleged sex abuse by a priest, in a case that rocked the French Catholic Church. Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, archbishop of Lyon, had been given a six-month suspended jail sentence last March for not reporting that a priest in his diocese had allegedly abused dozens of boy scouts in the 1980s and 1990s. He was found guilty of twice failing to report Bernard Preynat to the police, first in 2010 when the priest admitted to the cardinal that he had a history of abuse, and again in 2014, when one of Preynat's alleged victims told Barbarin about abuse he suffered. Preynat has been defrocked and is awaiting a ruling on March 16 in his trial on sex abuse charges. Barbarin, 69, had denied the charges against him but nonetheless offered his resignation to Pope Francis, who refused it pending the outcome of his appeal. The cardinal, who has stepped back from his duties, is the most senior French priest to be caught up in a global clerical pedophilia scandal, which has seen clergy members hauled before courts from Argentina to Australia. Barbarin, a staunch conservative who took over as archbishop in Lyon in 2002, has long been accused by victims' groups in Lyon of turning a blind eye to decades of child abuse in his diocese which blighted dozens of lives. Investigators had initially dropped the case against him in 2016 after concluding that the allegations were either impossible to prove or beyond the statute of limitations. But a group of victims succeeded in having the probe reopened, which led to Barbarin being tried. He insisted that he had ""never tried to hide, let alone cover up, these horrible facts"".

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that just as the global economy seemed to have stabilized, the coronavirus poses a new risk to growth in China and elsewhere. (READ: Virus crisis adds pressure on slowing Chinese economy) The SARS-like outbreak in China has left at least 170 people dead and thousands sickened, while airlines have canceled flights and businesses have been shuttered. That could undermine other major economies if global supply chains that flow from China are disrupted. ""There will clearly be implications at least in the near term for Chinese output and I would guess for some of their close neighbors,"" Powell told reporters following the Fed's policy meeting. However, ""the situation is really in its early stages and it's very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be,"" he said. ""We are very carefully monitoring the situation."" There remains grounds for ""cautious optimism"" about the global outlook,"" Powell said, but ""none of this is assured"" given continued uncertainties, including the impact of the virus outbreak. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left the benchmark interest rate steady in the target range of 1.5% to 1.75%, as expected, at the end of its two-day meeting. Policymakers also signaled that they want to see US inflation push a bit higher, to hit the 2% Fed target. After cutting rates 3 times last year in their effort to buoy the economy amid President Donald Trump's multi-front trade wars, this is the second policy meeting where the central bank has made no move, and it had seemed content to tread water unless there was a ""material change"" to the outlook. The statement Wednesday repeated that policymakers will ""continue to monitor the implications of incoming inflation for the economic outlook including global developments and muted inflation pressures."" Inflation goal and repo The Fed's statement however focuses mostly on the domestic economy, noting that household spending has been ""rising at a moderate pace,"" a slightly less upbeat view than in December. Slowing consumer spending on top of ""weak"" business investments and exports could undercut the Fed's ability to meet its inflation goal, which is running at just 1.5%. The statement tinkered with the wording from December to stress that the policy is aimed at ""inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2% inflation objective."" The FOMC decision, though widely expected, is unlikely to please Trump, who has repeatedly berated the Fed and called on Powell to slash rates to zero to supercharge the US economy, which the president says is at a disadvantage against foreign economies with lower rates. ""The Fed should get smart & lower the Rate to make our interest competitive with other Countries which pay much lower even though we are, by far, the high standard,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday, January 28. ""We would then focus on paying off & refinancing debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years late)!"" In a technical move, the Fed also slightly raised the interest it offers to banks with cash on deposit at the central bank, bumping it up to 1.6% from 1.55%, reversing the rate cut in September. And the FOMC announced that it will continue the measures to boost the amount of cash available in the financial system at least through the 2nd quarter of the year. The Fed had to take emergency steps in September after interest rates started to climb amid an apparent shortage of bank reserves, using overnight cash injections known as ""repo"" operations. Powell said the aim is to ensure reserves in the system remain above a floor of $1.5 trillion, while working on a plan to gradually reduce the Fed's asset purchases. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Fabrice Coffrini/AFP GENEVA, Switzerland – The UN health agency on Thursday, January 30, declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus from China – a rarely used designation that could lead to improved international co-ordination in tackling the disease. ""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he declared a ""public health emergency of international concern."" ""This is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" he said, emphasizing repeatedly that the measure was intended to help other countries less able to cope and praising the Chinese government for taking swift action to tackle the outbreak. ""We must all act together now to limit further spread.... We can only stop it together,"" said Tedros, who travelled to China this week and met with President Xi Jinping. Tedros also said there was ""no reason"" for any of the international travel or trade restrictions announced in recent days, such as flight suspensions, border closures and quarantine for apparently healthy travelers. Top airlines including Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa have suspended or cut back services to China. The WHO's Emergency Committee, an advisory body of international experts, said in a statement that evidence had shown that restricting movement of people and goods during public health emergencies ""may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions."" ""Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies,"" the committee said. But it added that ""in certain specific circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful"" – a possible reference to lockdowns within China that have affected millions of people. WHO stopped short of declaring an emergency last week because its emergency committee was divided over the issue. More than 7,700 people have been infected with the virus – almost all of them in China – and 170 have died. The WHO said there have also been 82 confirmed cases in 18 other countries, including cases of onward transmission in Germany, Japan, the United States and Vietnam. The WHO has called a public health emergency of international concern only 5 times since the relevant legislation took effect in 2007 – for swine flu, polio, Zika and twice for Ebola outbreaks in Africa. The designation, which is reviewed every 3 months, allows the WHO to issue global recommendations that the international community is expected to follow. Governments, companies and people around the world have already been escalating efforts to contain the illness, which is believed to have emerged from an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

Nearly 10,000 people have been infected in China by the new coronavirus and new cases were found abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected by the disease. The World Health Organization on Thursday, January 30, declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions and urged the numerous countries already taking such measures to reconsider. Nevertheless, countries intensified travel curbs. The US State Department raised its warning alert to the highest level, telling Americans ""do not travel"" to China and urged those already there to leave. Singapore, Vietnam and Mongolia went a step further. Citing a likely ""sharper rise"" in the spread of the virus, Singapore's government barred arrivals and transit passengers who visited China in the past 14 days, and stopped issuing all forms of new visas to Chinese passport holders. Mongolia will ban Chinese nationals and foreigners coming from the neighboring country by plane, train or road from Saturday, February 1, until March 2. Mongolians will be barred from going to China over the same period. In Vietnam, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered the suspension of new tourist visas for Chinese citizens and foreigners who have been in China over the last two weeks. Trade with China will also be ""discouraged"" until the outbreak abates, he said. Japan, meanwhile, joined Britain, Germany and other countries that have recommended that their citizens avoid China. Taking action The WHO has declared a global health emergency 5 times since the practice began in 2007 – for swine flu, polio, Zika and twice for Ebola. It allows the UN health body to issue recommendations that the international community is expected to follow. But the WHO warned Friday that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmissions of the virus and could even accelerate its spread. ""As we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases whenever people want to travel...if the official paths are not open, they will find unofficial paths,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said in Geneva. Authorities, businesses and worried people around the world have been taking matters into their own hands. Many major airlines this week suspended or reduced flights to China. Russia sealed its remote far-eastern frontier. Papua New Guinea went so far as to bar all visitors from ""Asian ports."" Some countries banned entry for travelers from Wuhan, the city in central Hubei province where the virus first surfaced. Italy, which has stopped all flights to and from China, declared a state of emergency on Friday to fast-track efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. Growing panic China on Friday said it sent charter planes to Thailand and Malaysia to bring Hubei residents back to Wuhan, citing the ""practical difficulties"" that they have encountered overseas. In a sign of growing global anxiety, more than 6,000 tourists were temporarily confined aboard their cruise ship at an Italian port after two Chinese passengers fell ill. They later tested negative for the coronavirus. More than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial complex in Indonesia's Sulawesi island have been quarantined over fears about the virus. Myanmar sent a plane back to China after a Chinese passenger was hospitalized with possible symptoms of the virus. The US reported its first case of person-to-person transmission of the virus on American soil – a man in Chicago who got it from his wife, who had travelled to Wuhan. Britain and Russia each reported their first two cases. Death toll grows China has taken extreme steps to stop the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. It has also suspended school nationwide and extended the Lunar New Year holiday in an effort to limit people travelling. But the toll continues to swell, rising to 213 after 43 new deaths were reported on Friday. All the dead have been in China. China's National Health Commission also confirmed 1,982 new cases, bringing the total to 9,692. That exceeds the 8,096 cases from SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) a similar pathogen that spread to more than two dozen countries in 2002-03, and killed 774 people, mostly in China and Hong Kong.

Singaporeans check their phones during their commute. AFP photo HONG KONG, China – Misleading bat soup videos, vastly inflated death tolls, quack remedies and vaccine conspiracies – a global deluge of misinformation is compounding public fears about China's new coronavirus and stoking racial stereotypes. Phoebe, a 40-year-old Hong Kong doctor, has been dismayed by some of the messages cropping up in her family Whatsapp group in recent days. ""I've seen information... telling people to use a hairdryer to disinfect your face and hands, or drink 60-degree hot water to keep healthy,"" she told AFP, asking not to be fully identified. ""I also saw a post shared in Facebook groups telling people to drink Dettol,"" she added, referencing a household disinfectant. As a health expert, she knew none of these methods would work – and could, in fact, be dangerous – so she set about warning her family. But how many more messages like that are out there? Researchers say the internet and chat apps are awash in them. (READ: FACT CHECK: Misinformation on novel coronavirus that spreads online) Ever since the emergence of the virus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan became public at the start of January, misinformation has stalked its spread. (READ: China virus death toll hits 212 – health officials) Cristina Tardaguila, from the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, says more than 50 fact-checking organizations in 30 countries have been dealing with ""3 waves"" of misinformation. ""One regarding the origins of the virus; one about a fake patent, and a third about how to prevent it/cure it,"" she told AFP. 'Racist morons' AFP's own fact-check teams have encountered a deluge of misinformation causing confusion and fear – including one out of Sri Lanka claiming China said 11 million people would die. Another was a false report in Australia listing common food brands and locations in Sydney that were supposedly tainted, while multiple posts pushed the erroneous idea that saline – basic salt water – can kill the virus. Some of the misinformation has tapped into prejudices towards Chinese eating habits, or has been used to fuel racist stereotypes. One video which went especially viral was a video of a woman tucking into bat soup. The footage, which was also picked up by western tabloid media outlets, was hailed as proof that China's appetite for exotic animals had caused the crisis. But it emerged that the video was shot in 2016 on the Pacific island of Palau by a Chinese travel blogger – a fact that few of the media outlets which ran the footage bothered to either check or update once the reality became known. While China's culinary tradition encompasses a vast array of ingredients that many elsewhere may turn their noses up at – and there are legitimate concerns over the country's hygiene standards and live animal markets – bat is not commonly consumed. Australia has seen multiple false claims that tap into prejudice towards its sizeable Chinese community. On Monday, Duncan Pegg, a lawmaker for Brisbane, alerted constituents to a fake Department of Health press release warning against travel to suburbs with high concentrations of Chinese Australians. ""To have false information spread by racist morons creates a sense of fear and anxiety,"" he told AFP. 'Fear and uncertainty' The far-right corners of the internet have also seized on the outbreak. One early hoax widely spread alleged a vaccine against the virus had already been patented in 2015. The story was quickly dismantled -- the patent was for a coronavirus found in poultry – but it gained traction within ""QAnon,"" a widely discredited movement that alleges a conspiracy within the US intelligence services to topple Donald Trump. Hal Turner – a far-right American radio host who the Southern Poverty Law Center says pushes white-supremacist views – has published a piece on his website claiming 112,000 people have already died in China, with 2.8 million quarantined. ""The coronavirus is a classic setup for the spread of rumours which are incubated in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty,"" said Robert Bartholomew, a medical sociologist in New Zeland who has written a book about public panics. Sensationalist media headlines – and historical distrust of China's opaque government – has made it easier for rumours to flourish, he told AFP. ""But for many people, their primary source of information is from social media which is notorious for carrying stories that are unvetted."" For health officials tasked with battling the outbreak, the relentless flood of false claims is making their jobs harder.

The suspected drug couriers, Reynaldo Cordero and Irene Biazon, were presented to the media during a press conference at the NBI headquarters on Thursday, January 30, days after their arrest. The January 27 joint operation of NBI-National Capital Region and NBI-Mimaropa stemmed from information received by the office NBI Mimaropa Director Rommel Vallejo that a certain “Kim” –  a New Bilibid Prison inmate – would faciliate the delivery of 10 packs of shabu to drug couriers in Cavite. Vallejo said Kim belonged to a group that operated in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. On Monday, January 27, as the suspects traversed Barangay Lotus Bukid in Panapaan 4, Bacoor City, NBI agents blocked their vehicle and found the illegal drugs inside the spare tire compartment of the car. The NBI said it was conducting an investigation with Bilibid officials to track down the source of the shabu supply and how Kim managed to conduct his illegal drug trade inside the national penitentiary. There had been previous drug busts involving shabu hidden in tea bags. Last year, police seized P802 million of shabu in tea bags in a buy-bust on Christmas Eve; a month earlier, P455 million worth of shabu also concealed in tea bags in Las Piñas.  – Rappler.com "
907,250634,"January 31, 2020",Philippines,"On last day of January, Taal Volcano stays at Alert Level 3",Acor Arceo,"It's been a long first month of 2020 for those affected by the Taal Volcano eruption, and Phivolcs reiterates that the unrest is not over yet  CONTINUING UNREST. Taal Volcano may appear calm, but it remains under Alert Level 3. Photo by Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Alert Level 3 stayed raised for Taal Volcano in the province of Batangas on Friday, January 31, the last day of what has been a long and difficult month for hundreds of thousands of people who have been affected. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said on Friday morning that the Taal Volcano Network recorded 116 volcanic earthquakes, including 2 low-frequency events, in the past 24 hours. Low-frequency quakes are ""caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface,"" according to the United States Geological Survey. The latest figure is slightly down from the 137 volcanic earthquakes recorded by the Taal Volcano Network in the previous 24-hour period. The Taal Volcano Network can record small earthquakes undetectable by the Philippine Seismic Network, which covers the whole country. The Philippine Seismic Network has plotted 763 volcanic earthquakes at Taal since 1 pm of January 12, when the unrest began. Of these, 177 were magnitudes 1.2 to 4.1 and were felt at Intensities I to V. ""These earthquakes signify magmatic activity beneath the Taal edifice that could lead to eruptive activity at the main crater,"" Phivolcs reiterated on Friday. Taal has been on Alert Level 3 since the morning of January 26. Before that, it was on Alert Level 4 for two weeks, beginning the evening of January 12. Phivolcs is applying a two-week observation period before it can downgrade the volcano's status further. Within that period, parameters such as volcanic earthquakes and gas emissions, among others, must go down. In the past 24 hours, Phivolcs observed ""moderate emission of white to dirty white steam-laden plumes 500 to 700 meters tall"" coming from Taal's main crater. This is compared to only ""weak emission"" of plumes that were 300 to 500 meters tall in the previous 24-hour period. The level of sulfur dioxide (SO2) remains ""below instrumental detection"" or too low to be detected. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. But Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum Jr said on Thursday, January 30, that magma is just around 5 kilometers below Taal's crater, seemingly ""parked"" there. The big question now is whether the magma will rise further and cause a major eruption or not. Phivolcs maintained that these are possible under Alert Level 3: Taal Volcano Island; the barangays of Bilibinwang, Subic Ilaya, and Banyaga in Agoncillo; and the barangays of Gulod, Buso-Buso, and Bugaan East in Laurel remain on lockdown. These areas are within a 7-kilometer radius from the main crater, which is Phivolcs' recommended danger zone while Taal is under Alert Level 3. ""Local government units are advised to assess areas outside the 7-kilometer radius for damage and road accessibilities and to strengthen preparedness, contingency, and communication measures in case of renewed unrest,"" reminded Phivolcs. The highest possible status is Alert Level 5. It would mean that a hazardous eruption is already in progress. The ongoing Taal eruption has affected at least 125,614 families or 467,890 persons in Batangas, Quezon, Laguna, and Cavite, said the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on Friday. Of those affected, 18,226 families or 63,574 persons remain in evacuation centers. The eruption has also caused at least P3.2 billion worth of damage to agriculture in Batangas, Cavite, and Laguna, as well as P137.16 million worth of damage to infrastructure in Batangas.

File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Transportation (DOTr) implemented increased safety measures in transport hubs nationwide following the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines. The coronavirus spreads through aerial droplets, particularly through sneezing and coughing. Thus, transport officials ordered that sanitizers and disinfectants be made available at terminals, train stations, ports, and airports. Land terminals and railway networks will conduct strict passenger screening to counter the spread of the virus. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) mandated all public utility vehicles (PUV) drivers and conductors to wear face masks while on duty, directing all franchise holders to ensure compliance. Terminal operators were also directed to ensure sanitation and cleanliness in their premises, as well as to provide face masks and disinfectants or sanitizers to passengers for free. Meanwhile, railway frontline and security personnel were also instructed to wear face masks and ensure the availability of face masks, sanitizers, and soaps in train stations. Train interiors and station premises, particularly surfaces that are frequently touched by the public, will be disinfected. The Metro Rail Transit line 3 (MRT3) trains, for one, will be cleaned and disinfected after every loop, according to DOTr communications director Goddes Libiran. For the aviation sector, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines also reactivated its communicable disease preparedness procedures on all CAAP-operated airports. Passengers will be strictly monitored. As early as January 23, the Manila International Airport Authority made sure that other precautionary measures such as ensuring the availability of hand sanitizers, providing an examination booth, and sanitizing quarantine areas are implemented. For the maritime sector, strict passenger screening will also be conducted at arrival areas in ports operated by the Philippine Ports Authority. Face masks and sanitizers will also be given out to frontline employees. The Maritime Industry Authority also advised ship owners and operators to report suspected cases of 2019-nCoV, install necessary medical equipment, and inform personnel about the virus. As of Friday morning, January 31, the death toll from the novel coronavirus has risen to 212. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak as an international emergency, allowing it to issue global recommendations for implementation by the international community. For now, the Philippines is calling for the repatriation of Filipinos in China, with the first batch of repatriates expected to arrive next week. The city of Manila, where the 2019-nCoV patient is currently located, is set to distribute 500,000 face masks to public school students. The public is advised to practice proper hygiene and coughing etiquette, including constant washing of hands and coughing into the crook of the elbow.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to flesh out his ideas for a free trade agreement along the lines of a recent EU deal with Canada, in a speech in early February. The EU mandate could be approved by national ministers on February 25, officials in Brussels suggest, which would mean talks could begin around March 1. Britain is hoping to open trade talks with the United States and other non-EU countries around the same time. Trade is not the only issue that must be resolved with Brussels, however. Britain and the EU closely cooperate on security and law enforcement, education and energy among many other issues. July 1: extension deadline The transition period is scheduled to last until December 31, 2020. Britain can ask to extend this for one or two years, but must inform the EU of its request by July 1. Johnson insists he will not do this, saying that Britain must be free of EU rules and regulations as soon as possible.

912,250639,"January 31, 2020",Thought Leaders,[ANALYSIS] Why did Philippine growth drop to an 8-year low?,JC Punongbayan,"Why is there disappointing growth, given the country's potential? Let's talk about lower investments and the weakening of industry.     Add this to the long string of bad news that greeted us this January. Last week the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) released its much-awaited report on the size and growth of the Philippine economy in 2019, as measured by gross domestic product or GDP. Although economic growth last quarter picked up at 6.4%, for 2019 as a whole, growth clocked in at a mere 5.9%. This is low for a couple of reasons. Not only did it just miss the government’s growth target of at least 6%, it’s also the lowest growth rate in 8 years (Figure 1). Growth also slid in 2019 for the 3rd consecutive year. Sure, our economy is still growing, and 5.9% is respectable vis-à-vis the growth of some Asian neighbors. But for a country with so much potential, 5.9% leaves much to be desired. In this article let’s look at the reasons behind this disappointing growth, and I’d like to highlight the decline of investments from the private sector, as well as the weakening of industry. The trouble is, we’re not talking about these unsettling developments as much as we need to.   Figure 1.  Decline of investments There are two basic ways we can dissect the economy to see what’s wrong with it. First, we can look at what Filipinos are spending on. For every P100 of spending last year, P69 was spent by you and me on consumption goods like food and clothing; P29 was spent by private investors on machinery and equipment; and P12 was spent by government on officials’ salaries and infrastructure projects. Take away P10 from total spending, because we imported more than we exported. Among these components, arguably the most important would be private investments, which fuel future growth: the more we spend on machinery and equipment today, the more growth we can expect tomorrow. Looking at the data, it’s worrisome to see that private investments failed to prop up growth. In fact, investments somehow dragged down growth (Figure 2). The last time this happened was in 2012 or 7 years prior.   Figure 2.  Drilling down further, we see that private investments dropped mostly on account of the poor production of “durable equipment,” which comprise road vehicles, telecommunications equipment, mining and construction machinery, and office machinery. Construction projects by the private sector did somehow counteract this dip in durable equipment. But even private construction’s contribution to growth fell from the previous year. Weaker industry The second way to probe GDP is by looking at the respective contributions of the economy’s key sectors: agriculture, industry, and services. Last year, for every P100 of national output, P58.4 came from services, P33.8 from industry, and a mere P7.8 from agriculture. Figure 3 shows that these sectors’ contributions to growth follow the same pattern.   Figure 3.  Some of these trends come as no surprise. In the past decade services have always been strong, and agriculture has always been weak. What’s surprising is the sudden weakness of industry, whose contribution to growth fell to its lowest level since 2011. This comes after years of robust, sizable industrial growth. Inspecting industry further, we can see that manufacturing and construction faltered the most. This, at a time when the government is pushing for both a Manufacturing Resurgence Program and an ambitious infrastructure project called Build, Build, Build. Industry’s newfound weakness is unfortunate. Some economists think industry is still one of the best and fastest ways to grow our economy: for the same amount of inputs, industry still produces more valuable output than services or agriculture. Other economists, however, contend that services might prove to be a suitable alternative ladder to growth nowadays, albeit less productive. After all, a full resurgence of the country’s industrial sector in the 21st century is arguably unlikely. What gives? A number of international and domestic factors might explain the anemic growth of both private investments and industry. For starters, one might pin the blame on the ongoing trade war waged by US President Donald Trump against Beijing, a trade war that is seriously disrupting world trade patterns and hampering global growth. Last year the world economy grew by just 2.9% – the slowest since the global financial crisis. Some studies initially suggested the Philippines might actually benefit from the Trumpian trade war. But we haven’t realized that just yet. More importantly, the trade war hit hard electronic products like semiconductors, which happen to be the Philippines’ biggest exports and imports. If only we aren’t so tied to electronics – and instead traded a more diverse basket of goods – our manufacturing sector wouldn’t be so vulnerable to the ongoing trade war. Another possible – perhaps equally important – reason for sluggish Philippine growth is the deterioration of our business climate. You won’t see this if you looked solely at statistics on business confidence collected by the Bangko Sentral. There you might even see an uptick. But in recent years there’s a heightening sense of policy uncertainty that’s spooking investors here and abroad. For one, foreign direct investments have declined in recent years, maybe because we’re not as attractive as other investment destinations in ASEAN. This trend might be exacerbated by a pending tax reform measure (Citira) that intends to rationalize investment incentives such as tax holidays. President Rodrigo Duterte also recently ramped up his foul attacks on certain corporations. These include Metro Manila’s water concessionaires (which he called “thieves” and whose operations have been arbitrarily cut short by 15 years) and media giant ABS-CBN (whose franchise renewal is in peril this year). The National Economic and Development Authority, in its official statement on the latest GDP figures, did mention the need to “eliminate policy uncertainties that affect the country’s business climate.” But I hope they acknowledge that a lot of those policy uncertainties are coming from the President himself. Beyond the budget delay Finally, it has become fashionable these days to blame weaker growth on the 2019 budget delay. Armed with data, we now know this is true – but only to some extent. Many projects under Build, Build, Build did get derailed – especially in the first half of 2019 – because of the budget delay. But public construction has since picked up, so much so that a fifth of growth in 2019 was due to government spending (Figure 2). Hence, the 2019 budget delay ceases to be a tenable explanation for anemic growth last year. Instead, one would paint a more accurate picture of the economy by pointing out the disturbing weakness of both private investments and industry. It remains to be seen if this is the beginning of a trend or a mere blip in the graph. But it’s a concerning development nonetheless, one the economic managers ought to be talking about more. – Rappler.com  The author is a PhD candidate and teaching fellow at the UP School of Economics.

The Palace urged the public to follow health officials’ advice, practice good personal hygiene like regular hand washing as a preventive measure, and wearing surgical masks when going around crowded areas. “The DOH assures us that every measure is being undertaken to contain the spread of the dreadful virus as well as monitoring and placing in quarantine those showing symptoms of having nCov,” Panelo said.

(READ: WHO declares international emergency over novel coronavirus) As a city that lost nearly 300 people to the SARS virus in 2003, Hong Kongers are taking few chances over the latest disease outbreak that began in central China and has since spread. (READ: China virus death toll hits 212 – health officials) Usually clogged streets have been uncharacteristically quiet, with light traffic and crowds over the Lunar New Year holiday. But the one place Hong Kongers are still willing to gather in sizeable numbers is outside their local pharmacies, hoping to snap up rapidly diminishing supplies of surgical facemasks. In the middle-class district of Tseung Kwan O, hundreds of residents patiently queued for hours on Thursday, January 30 to buy masks at a pharmacy that, like many outlets, was now limiting sales to one box per person. ""No matter how long this queue takes and how much it costs, I will at least buy enough for myself,"" a 26-year-old woman, who gave her surname as Tam, told AFP. Like many in the queue, she was angry at local authorities. ""I'm not satisfied with what the government is doing to prevent the epidemic. It doesn't close the border to mainlanders, and there is a lack of the supplies for masks in the market,"" she added. Semi-autonomous Hong Kong has resisted public pressure to close its border with the Chinese mainland although it has shuttered some crossings. A 17-year-old student, who gave her first name Michelle, said she had queued for more than an hour to get a box of masks. ""I hope this will be enough for a month. If I don't have enough masks, I might need to stay at home and can't go to school,"" she said. The South China Morning Post reported that some people camped out overnight after Watsons, one of the city's largest pharmacy chains, said a limited supply of facemasks would be sold on Thursday. Angry customers argued with staff outside some stores when supplies ran out, the paper reported. Supermarkets have also seen their shelves cleared in some districts. ""I bought a bag of rice and some canned food too,"" a 60-year-old retiree surnamed Sin told AFP. ""I am trying to avoid gathering with friends and reduce the amount of time to dine in at restaurants."" Hong Kong's government said it was ""striving to procure more surgical masks to cope with the epidemic,"" adding it had contacted 140 suppliers in 10 countries. It added that the ""supply of surgical masks in the market would still be tight in the near future"". The city's customs department said it had also launched an operation to weed out counterfeit masks that did not comply with international safety standards. – Rappler.com "

Actress, singer, and performer Jennifer Lopez discusses the next part of her career. Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images North America/AFP BIG YEAR. Actress, singer, and performer Jennifer Lopez discusses the next part of her career. Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images North America/AFP LOS ANGELES, USA – It's been a pretty big year for Jennifer Lopez. She turned 50, went on tour, earned rave reviews for her turn as a shrewd stripper in Hustlers, judged a new season of World of Dance, and got engaged to retired baseball star Alex Rodriguez. And on Sunday, February 2, she will take on the Super Bowl halftime show, one of the most-watched half-hours in American television, with Colombian singer Shakira. ""It's a lot of energy, it's very entertaining – there are heartfelt moments,"" Lopez told reporters on Thursday, January 30 in Miami. ""It's very Shakira and it's very Jennifer."" Lopez literally does it all – ""Jenny from the Block"" is an actress, singer, dancer, producer, and businesswoman. And she says she is finally used to ""being the boss."" ""Nobody in my family was really the boss of anything. We all had bosses,"" she told entertainment industry magazine Variety in an interview last year. ""But I guess in the past few years, I've come into my own in believing in myself and giving myself credit, knowing that 'OK, you're running the ship'."" Lopez was born in July 1969 in New York's Bronx borough to a security guard father and stay-at-home mom (later a school teacher) from Puerto Rico. After taking singing and dancing lessons in her youth, Lopez was cast in the 1986 film My Little Girl, and she caught the showbiz bug. Her big break came a few years later, when she was hired as a Fly Girl dancer on the popular television variety show In Living Color. That led to dance work with Janet Jackson, and a few small screen roles. But Lopez's huge break came in 1997 when she was cast as slain Mexican-American singer Selena in the film of the same name. She was chosen from more than 22,000 actresses for the role and became the first Latina actress to earn $1 million in Hollywood – a salary which she says set a precedent and helped blaze a trail. ""Maybe 30 years ago, it was very 'Oh, you're the Latin girl. You'll do Spanish roles – you'll play maids, you'll only be limited to this little box',"" she told Variety. ""It's about getting people in the business... to believe this girl can do more."" JLo: film star, pop star The year after Selena hit theaters, she starred opposite George Clooney in the thriller Out of Sight – a role that for many critics showed she had acting bona fides. And then in 1999, Lopez dropped her debut album On the 6. It included the mega-hits ""If You Had My Love,"" ""Let's Get Loud"" and ""Waiting for Tonight."" A pop star was born. Her parents thought acting was a dead end for Latinas. Her agents kept insisting that she choose between singing and acting. Lopez refused and the rest is history. JLo, as she is more or less universally known, has sold tens of millions of albums worldwide, including more than 10 million in the US alone. Concerts on her last tour were nearly all sold out. Her acting career has run the gamut, from the mega-flop Gigli with former beau Ben Affleck to her acclaimed performance as Ramona in Hustlers, a film she also produced. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for the role, which featured an athletic pole dance that left tongues wagging – and many thought she should have won an Oscar nod. Next act Lopez's personal life has kept her in the headlines, even when her acting and music careers have been relatively quiet, especially her relationship with Affleck, which sparked the term ""Bennifer."" But her 3 marriages so far, including to singer Marc Anthony, have ended in divorce. After she gave birth to twins Max and Emme in 2008, jobs were few and far between. Then came what Lopez calls her career's second act – her decision in 2011 to join the reality competition show American Idol as a judge. ""You can't hide on reality TV,"" she told Variety. ""And they got to see I was a real, caring person who was actually nice."" She recorded songs with Pitbull and Cardi B. She starred in television police drama Shades of Blue. And then came Hustlers. Last year, she even walked the catwalk for Versace, in a reimagining of a classic barely-there dress she wore 20 years ago to the Grammys. With Rodriguez, now a sports broadcaster after a long career in baseball, Lopez says she has found harmony between her professional and personal lives. Her next act after the Super Bowl? She's mulling a turn at directing – still rather a rarity for women in Tinseltown. The project is drug lord drama The Godmother, in which she also is set to star. – Rappler.com "
916,250643,"January 31, 2020",Philippines,"PH, U.S. armies look to 'future engagements' amid Duterte order to scrap VFA",JC Gotinga,"Joint activities between Philippine and US forces continue as the Duterte administration moves to terminate the PH-US Visiting Forces Agreement  JOINT EXERCISE. Philippine and US soldiers hold counter-terrorism drills in Palawan as part of their Balance Piston 20-1 joint training from January 26 to February 23, 2020. Photo from the Philippine Army MANILA, Philippines – Top-ranking generals of the Philippine and US armies discussed how to “strengthen their defense capabilities through future engagements” in a yearly bilateral meeting, even as the Philippine government moves to terminate its Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the United States. Philippine Army (PA) chief Lieutenant General Gilbert Gapay and US Army Pacific (USARPAC) deputy chief Major General John Johnson held the 8th Executive Steering Group Meeting at the Philippine Army (PA) Headquarters at Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City, on Wednesday, January 29, the PA said in a statement on Thursday, January 30. The PA looks to boost its aviation, air defense, airborne, combat engineer, fires, sustainment operations, cyber security capabilities, as well as its combined arms training methods and doctrine by having exercises and other engagements with the USARPAC. For the USARPAC, engagements with their Filipino counterparts improve their operational experience in an archipelagic environment such as the Philippines. The two armies also took up interoperability functions and training gaps learned from previous joint exercises. “We have come prepared and determined to plan out the next actions that will further strengthen our alliance. I am confident that we are moving in the right direction towards ensuring that the alliance remains strong, dynamic, and relevant,” Gapay said. Johnson, for his part, said: “Everything we do here should support the mutual defense training and demonstrate the commitment that we have for each other. We learn together, we become more capable and we build trust.” Scrap the VFA? Last week, President Rodrigo Duterte ordered to terminate the VFA over what he said was the US government’s interference in Philippine sovereign affairs. Duterte made the statement a day after Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa confirmed that his US visa had been canceled. The VFA of 1998, anchored on the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty between the Philippines and the US, allows for US military presence in the Philippines. The agreement forms the basis of joint military exercises, and security cooperation between the two forces. The Philippine and US militaries held a total of 281 joint activities in 2019. They planned to hold 300 such activities this year. The US government’s criticism of Duterte’s violent campaign against illegal drugs and the extrajudicial killings that came with it has angered Duterte, especially when the US Senate resolved to apply the Global Magnitsky Act to Philippine officials involved in the “war on drugs.” Resulting sanctions include the denial or cancellation of their US visas. The US government also included a similar provision in its 2020 national budget law, condemning the unlawful detention of Senator Leila de Lima, a staunch Duterte critic. The provision denies Philippine officials and personalities involved in De Lima’s case, entry to the US. Duterte has been criticized for putting the VFA on the line over Dela Rosa’s visa and his administration’s tussles with the US government. Several lawmakers have opposed the agreement’s termination. Duterte’s Cabinet is still studying the implications and consequences of scrapping the VFA and there is no final word yet if it would indeed be terminated, although Duterte reiterated his order on Wednesday night. New exercise On the ground, activities between Philippine and US forces continue. The PA and the US Army debuted a new joint exercise in Palawan on January 26, and set to run until February 23. The Balance Piston 20-1 training exercise aims to strengthen the PA’s counter-terrorism capabilities, and to enhance the interoperability between the PA and the US Army, the PA said in a separate media release. “The Philippine Army continues to support and conduct trainings with its foreign counterparts as it helps ensure that our troops get the necessary exercise to enhance their capabilities in various fields. It also helps develop and strengthen our cooperation with other armies in training and information exchange,” said PA spokesperson Colonel Ramon Zagala. Balance Piston 20-1 involves the Philippine Army’s 18th Special Forces Company, Special Forces Regiment (Airborne), and the US Army’s 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne). – Rappler.com "

Roger Federer thinks he has more to show. Photo by William West/AFP  MELBOURNE, Australia – Injury-hit Roger Federer said Thursday, January 30 he had no plans to retire and insisted he was still in good enough shape to win Grand Slams after crashing out of the Australian Open semifinals to Novak Djokovic. The 38-year-old fell to the Serb 7-6 (7/1), 6-4, 6-3, admitting he only had ""a 3%"" chance as he nursed a groin injury picked up in his quarterfinal epic against Tennys Sandgren, where he saved 7 match points. Despite the disappointment, the Swiss great believes he is still a force to be reckoned with. ""Yes, I do believe that,"" the world No. 3 said, when asked he if he was confident about adding to his 20 Grand Slam titles. ""I think by having the year that I had last year, also with what I have in my game, how I'm playing, I do feel that, yeah."" Federer, who reached last year's Roland Garros semifinals and lost a five-set Wimbledon final to Djokovic, said he hopes to return to Melbourne in 2021 for a crack at a seventh title. ""You never know what the future holds. Especially my age, you don't know,"" he said. ""I'm confident. I'm happy how I'm feeling, to be honest. I got through a good, nice training block. No plans to retire. ""From that standpoint, we'll see how the year goes, how everything is with the family. We'll go from there. Of course, I hope to be back."" Federer was seen around Melbourne Park before the match with tape on his upper right leg and there were even rumors that he might pull out of the Djokovic showdown. But that is not in the 38-year-old's nature – he has only ever given up walkovers 4 times in his long career, and never retired from any of his more than 1,500 matches over two decades. 'Today was horrible' Federer said he took a day off after the Sandgren match and barely warmed up for Djokovic, but felt he was in good enough shape to at least give the Serb a run for his money. ""Today was horrible, to go through what I did. Nice entrance, nice sendoff, and in between is one to forget because you know you have a 3% chance to win,"" he said. ""It's frustrating. (But) I don't think I would have gone on court if I felt like I had no chance to win. We saw I was still being able to make a match out of it.  ""Who knows maybe how he feels as well. He's a great, great player. We know that. He makes you hit balls. He serves well, he returns well, he moves well. He's mentally very tough.""  Federer said the injury did not appear to be serious.  ""I'm very happy that I don't feel any worse than when I started. That's super-encouraging. So I think we'll go from there and we'll see if I need to do another scan or not,"" said the tennis legend.  Djokovic said he had ""huge respect"" for the resilient Federer's record of never retiring from a match.  ""I did have retirements throughout my career. I know how it feels when you're hurt on the court,"" he said.  ""It's an amazing fact that he has never retired his match, not a single match, throughout his career. Huge respect for that.""  "

""All LGUs nationwide are advised to create their respective task forces to implement DOH protocols and guidelines and extend full cooperation to the DOH and other government agencies to meet the world health emergency,"" DILG Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said in a statement on Friday, January 31. Malaya said Interior Secretary Eduardo Año was prompted to give the directive after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency in relation to the novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed 212  people in China alone as of Friday. The DILG said the task force will be led either by the governor or the mayor, who will ensure that local health personnel have the necessary equipment and protective gear. The task force will also handle the referral and transport of constituents suspected of  2019-nCoV infection to a DOH-designated hospital. Local chief executives,  in coordination with the DOH, are also expected to train health workers on 2019-nCoV prevention, containment, and control. LGUs must also conduct information campaigns on the virus in their areas. The DILG said that LGUs hosting international airports must coordinate with the Bureau of Immigration and airport authorities to ensure the implementation of quarantine procedures. LGUs are expected to cooperate with the DOH in the latter's contact-tracing of individuals who encountered a confirmed 2019-nCoV patient. ""The mayor should immediately inform the DOH should there be reasonable basis to place an individual under quarantine. The DOH needs the support of all LGUs in this important matter and local and police authorities should extend all possible assistance in this regard,"" Malaya said.

A number of airlines had either halted or reduced flights to China.

A woman standing near the man, wearing pink pyjamas and a Mao cap, said she believed he had died from the virus. ""It's terrible,"" she said. ""These days many people have died."" Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans. The virus, which emerged late last year, has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China, with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone. With the virus spreading to other countries, the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency. Torment Authorities have imposed an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan, blocking off roads out of the city and banning flights, in a bid to stop the virus spreading. Those who are trapped are enduring a tormenting wait for the lockdown to end, for a cure to be found, or even just for check-ups at overwhelmed hospitals. AFP reporters in Wuhan have seen long queues at hospitals, with some patients saying they had queued for two days to see a doctor. Many brought their own chairs for the wait. With most traffic banned, people who venture outside have to walk or bike everywhere in the huge city. The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital, one of the main medical centers for treating those with virus symptoms. A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits. One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask. He quickly followed their orders. In the two hours that AFP observed the scene, at least 15 ambulances passed by, attending other calls. Finally, a white van with blacked-out windows arrived to take away the man. The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag, and carried into the van on a stretcher.

The State Department issued a level 4 warning – up from urging Americans to ""reconsider"" travel to China – and said any nationals in China now ""should consider departing using commercial means."" In the travel advisory, the department cited the World Health Organization's (WHO) decision that the ""rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern."" The WHO declared the global emergency earlier Thursday over the new coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, as China reported the death toll had climbed to 213 with nearly 10,000 infections. The UN health agency based in Geneva had initially downplayed the threat posed by the disease, but revised its risk assessment after crisis talks. In the updated travel advisory, the State Department recalled that last week it had ordered the departure of all non-emergency US personnel and their family members from Wuhan. ""The US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Hubei province,"" the advisory said. The US reported its first case Thursday of a person catching the virus from another person on American soil – a man in Chicago who contracted the illness from his wife, who had travelled to Wuhan. Many other countries have also urged their citizens not to visit China, while some have banned entry for travelers from Wuhan. Airlines began cancelling flights servicing China on Wednesday, and more followed suit on Thursday. Israel barred all flights from China, while Russia said it was closing its far eastern border with China over the outbreak. More than 6,000 tourists were temporarily put under lockdown aboard a cruise ship at an Italian port after two Chinese passengers were isolated over fears they could be carrying the virus. They later tested negative for the illness. In its advisory, the State Department warned US travelers they should ""be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice.""

In this file photo taken on October 23, 2019 The Facebook ""like"" sign is seen at Facebook's corporate headquarters campus in Menlo Park, California, on October 23, 2019. Photo by Josh Edelson/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – Facebook shares came under heavy selling pressure Thursday as the latest earnings report for the leading social network highlighted mushrooming costs in dealing with privacy, abuse and misinformation. Shares plunged 7% in opening trade to $207.57 as investors soured on Facebook even after a 4th quarter update largely in line with analyst estimates. Profit rose 7% from a year ago to $7.3 billion, while revenue increased 25% to $21 billion in the final 3 months of last year, the update showed. The number of people using Facebook monthly climbed 8% to 2.5 billion. For all its apps including Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, the figure was 2.89 billion. Some analysts said the results pointed to weaker growth ahead for Facebook. ""The specter of slowing growth took the edge off what has been an excellent run for the shares during 2019,"" said independent analyst Richard Windsor on his Radio Free Mobile blog. ""Despite the seemingly endless series of leaks and scandals, growth had remained strong, but some cracks are finally beginning to show."" Highlighting those concerns, Facebook acknowledged it agreed to pay a $550 million settlement in a class action suit based on allegations that users' biometric data was illegally gathered using photo-scanning technology and then stored. The lawsuit stemmed from an Illinois law on biometric privacy, underscoring concerns on the costs of dealing with a range of data protection measures in Europe, California and elsewhere. Analyst Michael Levine of Pivotal Research Group downgraded Facebook after the earnings reporting, citing weaker-than-expected ad revenues and ""headwinds"" that could limit its ability to collect data for targeted ads, the largest source of revenue. ""More of the headwinds are ahead of us rather than behind us,"" Levine said in a research note. Investors appear concerned about the continuing increases in the amount of money Facebook spends as it pours resources into protecting privacy and preventing the network from being used as a platform for hate speech, abuse, and disinformation. Costs in the recently ended fourth quarter rose 34% to $12.2 billion. Facebook ended the year with its employee ranks up 26% to nearly 45,000. Facebook is likely to see pressure from privacy rules hobbling the company's ability to effectively target its money-making ads. Chief financial officer David Wehner told analysts the company expects revenue growth to slow, in part due to regulations and ""other ad-targeting related headwinds."" Recent data privacy regulations in Europe and California as well as enhancements to browser or operating system software from Google and Apple, along with tools added by Facebook itself, are expected to limit the ability of the social network to use ""signals"" from third-party websites to more finely target ads, Wehner said. Privacy, election integrity Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg welcomed what he called ""a good quarter and a strong end to the year"" while noting that the company had much work to do. He said Facebook was ramping up efforts to comply with a record $5 billion settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission on privacy controls while also fighting manipulation efforts during the US election campaign. ""As part of our FTC settlement, we committed to building privacy controls and auditing that will set a new standard for our industry – going beyond anything that's required by law today,"" Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page. ""We're very focused on election integrity – and this is an area where I'm proud of the progress we've made preventing foreign interference. ""We were behind in 2016, but after working to protect elections in countries across the world from the EU to India to Mexico to the US midterms for the past few years, we think our systems are now more advanced than any other company."" Some still upbeat Some analysts remained upbeat on Facebook, noting that advertising revenues, the vast majority of cash it generates, rose 25% at $20.7 billion in the quarter. Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said Facebook still has a ""moat"" as the largest social network, which will attract advertisers. ""The growth in users and user engagement, along with the valuable data that they generate, makes Facebook attractive to advertisers in the short and long term,"" Mogharabi said in a note to clients. Debra Aho Williamson said Facebook has been able to maintain momentum despite a barrage of criticism and regulatory issues. ""Despite all of the concerns that have been swirling around the company in the past two years, it beat expectations on revenue, and it demonstrated continued growth in its user base,"" she said. – Rappler.com "

Masked workers disinfect a passenger throughfare at the Taoyuan International Airport on January 22, 2020 after Taiwan reported its first case of the novel coronavirus. Photo by Chen Chi-chuan/AFP MANILA, Philippines – The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday, January 30 (January 31, Manila time), declared an international emergency over the deadly novel coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases and deaths continue to rise. As of early Friday, January 31, the novel coronavirus has killed 212 people and infected over 8,000 worldwide. (READ: The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?) The Philippine's Department of Health confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the country – a female patient who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan in China. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?) What happens now after the WHO declaration? Here are the important things you need to know about the declaration of an international health emergency: The declaration of a global emergency is formally called the Public Health Emergency of International Concern or the PHEIC by WHO. The 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR) define PHEIC as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.” The 2005 IHR is a document that serves as a guide for the prevention or spread of public health risks that threaten people globally. To fall under a PHEIC, a public health situation: The PHEIC on the novel coronavirus is the 6th declaration that WHO has made. The others include: the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009, polio outbreak in 2014, West Africa Ebola epidemic in 2014, Zika virus outbreak in 2016, and the Kivu Ebola epidemic in 2018. The January 30 declaration, as advised by a team of international experts, focuses mainly on preventing the further spread of the virus. In a press conference, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the organization’s greatest concern is “the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.” In a statement, WHO said that a global coordinated effort is vital to improve preparedness in other areas around the world, especially countries that may need additional support in addressing the spread of the virus. It also emphasized that the declaration of the international emergency “should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In compliance with IHR article 4, the WHO emergency committee urges the global community to continue to work together towards discovering new information on the novel coronavirus and other similar public health risks. These information that may prove to be very useful include the novel coronavirus' full potential for human-to-human transmission, how a country prepared or prevented further spread of the virus, and valuable research for possible treatment. The PHEIC also calls for global support for low- and middle-income countries in the face of a global spread of the novel coronavirus, assistance in their response, and access to diagnostics and potential vaccines, among others. In a nutshell, countries that currently have confirmed cases are now expected to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus and at the same time ensure that the handling of the situation will not border on discrimination. Now that the novel coronavirus situation is considered a global health emergency, the WHO Emergency Committee urges all countries to be prepared for the containment of cases, including: “Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research,” it said. As countries follow these steps, the committee demands full transparency and to share their full data with WHO, as legally required by the IHR. It also does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current situation. Any further measures on travels should be adequately consulted with WHO. “Countries must inform WHO about any travel measures taken, as required by the IHR,” it said. “Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination,” the committee added. The WHO Emergency Committee is expected to meet again in 3 months to adjust any declaration and recommendations to align with new information. – Rappler.com Other news you can use: "

Cagayan de Oro CIty Mayor Oscar Moreno shows Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu the city's news sprawling 45-hectare sanitary landfill. Photo by Bobby Lagsa/Rappler CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, Philippines –  Mayor Oscar Moreno on Thursday, January 30, said that nearby municipalities may use the new sanitary landfill in Barangay Pagalungan here for a fee. In 2016, the city closed its old Zayas dumpsite in compliance with orders from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Department of Interior and Local Government. Cagayan de Oro opened the 45-hectare landfill in Barangay Pagalungan as a replacement. Moreno showed DENR Secretary Roy Cimatu the new dumpsite and landfill of the city together with DENR Region 10 (Northern Mindanao) officials. ""Even from the very start, we planned that this is not just for Cagayan de Oro. We know that it's not easy to do and it's very expensive (to operate a landfill) and to have it managed by groups that really have the technical expertise. And it's not a simple operation,"" Moreno said. Moreno said the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) plans to build roads to connect the landfill to the western part of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon. Once the roads are completed, delivery trucks do not have to pass through existing roads of the city. But Moreno said the city will collect fees from towns that will throw their waste in the new landfill. He said DILG records show that  85% of towns and cities across the country do not have their own sanitary landfills. With an accessible landfill, Moreno added,  local governments will not only focus on garbage collection. The new landfill will only accept residual waste as mandated by Republic Act 9003 or the Solid Waste Management Act. ""Like I said, the cost of the land, operations of the landfill, the delivery of garbage, that is expensive, it's not a joke,"" Moreno said.  SANITARY. A sanitary landfill workers sprays anti-bacterial agent into a newly dumped residual waste at the Cagayan de Oro City Sanitary Landfill in Barangay Pagalungan. Photo bt Bobby Lagsa/Rappler Previously, Moreno and the city councilors faced a case at the environmental ombudsman as Cagayan de Oro failed to comply with RA 9003, which required LGUs to operate an engineered sanitary landfill. As a response, the city opened its sanitary landfill in 2016. The city government  pays garbage operator IPMCDC P499.00 per ton of residual waste. Cagayan de Oro produces 1,200 tons per day. The city government has allowed barangays to segregate garbage at site to reduce the volume of waste, and ensure that garbage collected must be residual. Cagayan de Oro is expected to lesses its volume of garbage as the city started implementing a ban on single-use plastics starting January 15. Cellophanes are only allowed for fish and meat products. Cimatu is impressed DENR Roy Cimatu said  he was impressed with the way the Cagayan de Oro managed to close the dumpsite and transition into the landfill operation. ""When I was still the commander of the 4th Infantry Division here, I used to passed by the dumpsite and I get mad looking at it. Now, I am the DENR Secretary, I am glad that it was shut down and we get a sprawling modern landfill here, so congratulations to your city,"" Cimatu said. Prior to visiting the landfill, Cimatu dropped by the old dumpsite that is now being transformed into an ecopark. The former dumpsite scavengers now have their own cooperative which produces ecobricks out of grounded plastic and cement. ""After all these years, they said it has been 30 years (of dumpsite operations), what is now the use of the land?

Photo form Cebu City Public Information Office CEBU CITY, Philippines – A consortium between SM Investments and the Ayala Corporation broke ground on its over 45-hectare project at the South Road Properties in Cebu City on Wednesday, January 29. The project is the subject of a court case filed by former city mayor Tomas Osmeña, who sued several city officials involved in the sale, including current Mayor Edgar Labella, his Vice Mayor Michael Rama, and other city councilors.   At the time of the sale, Rama was mayor and Labella was vice mayor.   Osmeña alleges that the bid was not done properly and the lot was sold at under market value.  The property was sold for about P17 billion in 2015 to the SM-Ayala consortium. (READ: Osmeña files suit vs Cebu City government, real estate conglomerates over SRP deal) Cebu Holdings Incorporated, an Ayala subsidiary, represented Ayala Land at the groundbreaking. Labella spoke about the conflict during the time he was presiding officer of the city council. “We were actually outnumbered that time. The opposition was the majority. But there were well-meaning members of the city council who set aside partisan posturings because they believe in the project, and I call them the unsung heroes, aside of course, from the other members of the city council,” Labella said. Despite the lawsuit, the development plans will move ahead since there has not been a temporary restraining order (TRO) issued on the property. “Now, we look backward and forward. We look backward with overflowing gratitude to these people and we look forward with great hope and exciting expectation for this project,” Labella said. The first-term mayor expects that the project would generate over P316 billion in investments and two million direct and indirect jobs in Cebu City. Included in the project is a 16,000-capacity convention center and a one-hectare park.   Labella said, over time the project would contribute P22 billion to the city’s revenues through permits, taxes, and other regulatory fees.  “It is one of the thrusts of our administration that we should decrease the poverty level in the city of Cebu. It is a sad reality that, up until now, after so many years, our country, including this city, is facing a very serious political and social imbalance,” he said. According to the city government, 70% of the project will be for commercial space, while 30% will be residential.  The planned Bus Rapid Transit project was also realigned to run through the SRP. – Rappler.com "

The European Union, setting guidelines that mirror those announced a day earlier by Britain, said Wednesday that countries should ban telecoms operators deemed to be a security risk. But it stopped short of banning Huawei, which Washington says is an arm of China's communist regime, and left the decision to each country.

Previous emergencies include the outbreaks of swine flu, ebola, and zika virus.  OUTBREAK. At least 57 cases of Zika virus disease were recorded in the Philippines. MANILA, Philippines – The World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international public health emergency on January 30 as the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from China claimed more lives. It is the 6th public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) the WHO has declared since 2009. (READ: FAST FACTS: What's next after novel coronavirus declared an int'l emergency?) This coincided with confirmation from Health Secretary Francisco Duque III of the first case of the virus in the Philippines involving a 38-year-old woman who traveled from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) What happened in the past 5 incidents declared as a global public health emergency, and how were they handled? Swine flu pandemic (2009) After first being discovered in the United States in early 2009, the swine flu, or influenza A H1N1 pandemic was declared in June that same year. By this time, 74 countries and territories had confirmed infections. According to WHO, swine flu was a new virus when it emerged and most people had no or little immunity to it. By February 2010, the death toll hit 16,000, mostly from countries with inadequate resources for widespread laboratory testing. The outbreak was declared over in August 2010. While this does not mean the virus had been eradicated, WHO saw that it had “largely run its course.” The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that 151,000 to 575,400 people died from the pandemic worldwide during the first year the virus circulated. The H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic is now a regular human flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally worldwide. The manufacturers that produce seasonal flu vaccines produced the swine flu shot the same way seasonal vaccines are made. Polio resurgence (2014) The international spread of wild poliovirus was declared a PHEIC in May 2014. A spike of cases occurred in Pakistan, Syria, and Cameroon and began to spread to other countries. WHO urged all residents and long-term visitors from the 3 countries to have themselves vaccinated before traveling and to provide proof of vaccination. Inaccessibility remains to be a major risk, especially for several countries that have infection cases. These include Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, Somalia, Myanmar, and Indonesia. As of January 2020, polio is still considered a PHEIC. Although wild poliovirus type 2 and type 3 have been eradicated, there are still cases of wild polio type 1 and vaccine-derived poliovirus types. Vaccine-derived polio type 1 was found in recent cases in the Philippines. (READ: PH declares polio outbreak as disease returns after 19 years) There is no cure for polio, but it can be prevented by vaccination. WHO reported a 99% decrease in wild polio cases, from 350,000 in 1988 to 33 in 2018. In 2018, 85% of infants around the world received 3 doses of polio vaccine. The CDC however, recommends 4 doses. Ebola epidemics (2014 and 2019) Just 3 months after polio was declared a PHEIC, the same was done in the case of the Ebola virus disease in West Africa in August 2014. Since Ebola is not airborne and can only be transmitted through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, WHO recommended no ban on travel or trade. However, the WHO Emergency Committee recommended that countries still prepare to detect, investigate, and manage Ebola cases. This includes preparing their capacity to identify and care for travelers originating from Ebola-infected areas. In 2016, when risk of international spread became low, WHO lifted the PHEIC status of Ebola. It had killed 11,300 people by then. The second largest Ebola outbreak on record was declared on August 1, 2018, after occuring in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of Congo. WHO named it a PHEIC in July 2019. As of January 28, 2020, there are 3,302 confirmed cases, 2,242 deaths, and 1,154 survivors of the disease. The US Food and Drug Administration has had an Ebola vaccine since December 2019. Zika virus (2016) The Zika virus disease, which is caused by a virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, had been identified in humans since 1952. But in February 2016, reports came out that microcephaly, a condition where the head circumference is smaller than usual, and other neurological disorders were linked with cases of Zika in Brazil. This led to the declaration of a PHEIC due to their being extraordinary cases. Zika infection during pregnancy was found to lead to such disorders in infants and other complications like stillbirth. The CDC advised pregnant women to avoid traveling to affected areas. In May 2016, more than 100 doctors and scientists signed an open letter to WHO Director General Margaret Chan, calling for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro to be postponed due to the Zika outbreak. However, the WHO lifted the emergency status in November 2016 as research demonstrated the link of Zika and microcephaly. While the virus was still a challenge for WHO, the outbreak no longer constituted a PHEIC, following its definition. By the end of 2016, the Zika virus had spread throughout the Americas and Europe, and in some parts of Asia and Oceania.The Pan American Health Organization reported 175,063 confirmed cases in the Americas. At least 57 cases were found in the Philippines in 2017. Zika transmission still persists, but has generally been at low levels from 2018 to present. Currently, there is no vaccine or medicine for Zika, although development is underway. – Rappler.com Sources: World Health Organization, AIMS Public Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Other updates on the novel coronavirus: "

""What we have seen in the last couple of days is a descent into constitutional madness,"" Schiff told the Senate trial. ""Almost half a century ago, we had a president who said, well, when the president does it that means it is not illegal."" ""Have we learned nothing in the last half century? 'Frankly a disgrace' Schiff spoke during the second day of questions submitted to the prosecution and defense from the 100 senators sitting as the jury. Trump, only the third president in US history to be impeached and stand trial, is fighting charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his scheme to pressure Ukraine last year to open an investigation into possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Trump is alleged to have frozen $391 million in defense aid to force Kiev to announce probes into Biden and the Democrats. Democrats say this is an illicit invitation of a foreign government to interfere in a US election. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, calling the entire process a politically driven ""witch hunt."" Speaking in Michigan on Thursday, Trump labelled the impeachment trial ""frankly, a disgrace to our country."" Dangerous argument Trump's defense team has argued alternatively that the impeachment is politically driven, that Trump did not tie Ukraine aid to the investigations he sought, that he had reason to seek a probe into his political rival, and that he had the legal right to do so as president. On Wednesday, January 29, Dershowitz, a famous criminal defense lawyer and former Harvard University professor, declared that Trump could make those demands if he thought his reelection was ""in the public interest."" ""If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,"" he said. Democrats and much of the US legal community were stunned by the claim. ""I can't think of anything more dangerous to our democracy,"" said Neal Katyal, a former top Justice Department official and a law professor at Georgetown University. ""Every president can say, 'heck, I'm doing this in the nation's interest.'"" ""It seems like we're back to where we were. The president says it, it's not illegal,"" said Schiff. ""That is the normalization of lawlessness. I would hope that every American would recognize that it's wrong to seek foreign help in an American election."" ""What we have seen in the last couple of days is a descent into constitutional madness,"" Schiff told the Senate trial. Voters should decide On Thursday, Trump's defense team avoided the issue and repeatedly argued that it was improper to be seeking a popular president's removal by trial in an election year. White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said Democrats were using impeachment ""as a political weapon"" and that voters, and not the Senate, should decide Trump's fate in the November election. ""Let's leave it to the people of the United States.... That's who should decide who the president of this country should be. It will be a few months from now, and they should decide,"" he said. Eric Herschmann, another of Trump's lawyer, appeared to argue that Trump's popularity and policy success invalidated any attempt to convict him at trial. ""The president's approval rating while we are sitting here in the middle of these impeachment proceedings has hit an all-time high,"" Herschmann said. ""We, the American people, are happier,"" he said. ""We trust the American people to decide who should be our president."" Uphill fight Democrats admitted they were fighting an uphill battle to convince Republicans to go against Trump. After Thursday's question session, they will have a few hours Friday, January 31 to push for Senate subpoenas of direct witnesses to Trump's alleged wrongdoing. First on their list is former White House national security advisor John Bolton, who reportedly claims in a yet-to-be-published book that Trump told him personally that military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev's investigating Biden. But Democrats need to get a majority of the Senate to support a witness call, and Republicans control 53 seats, while the Democrats have 47. Both sides were pressuring a handful of Republican senators on the issue, but by Thursday it was not clear that Democrats had secured the four crossovers they need in order to call witnesses. If Democrats fail on the witnesses, Republicans are expected to bring the trial to final votes on the two impeachment charges. With conviction and removal of the president requiring a two-thirds majority, Trump's acquittal is virtually assured. – Rappler.com "

Tourists enjoy the cold weather at Northern Blossom Flower Park in Atok Benguet. Photo by Mau Victa/Rappler BAGUIO CITY – Usually cold weather is most welcome here in Baguio. But when the temperature dipped to 11.2 degrees at 5 am Friday, January 31, it was met with more anxiety than excitement. It is the coldest temperature for Baguio this year. Last January 4, the temperature dipped to 11.4 degrees. In the higher reaches of Benguet, the cold reached 10 degrees, this does not even include the wind chill factor which can bring the cold down to 5 degrees. If the tailend of amihan or easterly winds is at its last blast, the weather might still get colder. Last year, it reached its coldest at 9.8 degrees on January 28. This may be good for the cold hunters. But with the first victim of coronavirus in the Philippines identified last Thursday, January 31, and persons under investigation reaching 53, the cold is actually bad news. Cold weather is known to serve as an ideal ground for viruses like the common cold and the flu. These viruses  have achieved the ability to spread between people, as they are more stable in cold air, and low humidity helps them to “float” for longer. Cold weather also decreases the bodily defenses, allowing viruses to enter the body with ease. But so far, Baguio is safe from the dreaded coronavirus. Department of Health-Cordillera (Kagawaran Ng Kalusugan - Cordillera) Infectious Disease Cluster Head Dr. Jennifer Joyce Pira said that there are no persons under investigation (PUI) with regards to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Pira said the DOH-CAR only monitored an individual who arrived from Guangzhou, China but has no history of travel to Wuhan, China and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV case. The person also has no known contact with individuals with severe acute respiratory illness or sick animals. She said that although the individual and two of his roommates are under quarantine, they are all doing well and show no signs of illnesses. The DOH-CAR stressed that there are no cases of 2019-nCoV in the Cordillera region to date. – Rappler.com "

LeBron James and Anthony Davis try to lead the Lakers in their first game since Kobe Bryant's shock death. Photo by Steve Dykes/Getty Images/AFP LOS ANGELES, USA – The Los Angeles Lakers, shattered by the death of franchise icon Kobe Bryant, are trying to wrench their attention back to their pursuit of an NBA title, a chase that resumes Friday, January 31 (Saturday, February 1, Philippine time) against the Portland Trail Blazers. ""We're concentrating on the work,"" head coach Frank Vogel told reporters at the team's practice facility in suburban El Segundo. ""There's therapy in the work."" Before getting down to the most serious work, however, the Lakers warmed up outside with a little soccer and American football designed to lighten the atmosphere. ""We are striking a balance of trying to make guys feel good,"" Vogel said. ""Laughter is always a good remedy for something like this when it's appropriate. ""Today's workout outside, it's not the first time we've done that. But it does feel good to be out there."" The Lakers were on their way home from Philadelphia when Bryant – who won 5 NBA titles in a 20-year career with the club – was killed in a helicopter crash in suburban Calabasas on Sunday. The 41-year-od was among 9 people who died, a group that included his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, her Mamba Academy basketball teammates Payton Chester and Alyssa Altobelli, Altobelli's parents John and Keri, and Chester's mother Sarah. Pilot Ara Zobayan and Christina Mauser, an assistant coach of the Mamba Academy team, also died. Lakers superstar LeBron James was among many in the NBA – and the greater sports world around the globe – to express his anguish at Bryant's death on social media. But James and other Lakers players have yet to speak publicly about the loss of a player who defined one generation of NBA players and inspired another. Bryant's wife Vanessa broke her silence in an Instagram post on Wednesday night, saying she was ""devastated"" by the sudden loss of her husband and daughter. ""Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way,"" she wrote. ""Our love for them is endless – and that's to say, immeasurable."" Jeanie Buss, the controlling owner and president of the Lakers, offered condolences via Instagram on Thursday to Vanessa Bryant and the couple's other 3 daughters: Natalia, Bianka and Capri. She also expressed sympathy and support for the families of the other victims. ""The entire Laker family mourns with you,"" she said. Buss, the daughter of longtime Lakers owner Jerry Buss, said Bryant helped her go on after her father died – 3 years before Bryant retired in 2016. ""My father loved you like a son, which makes us family,"" Buss wrote. Amid the grief, Vogel said he had been gradually ramping up the team's preparations for the Trail Blazers. Players and staff got together Tuesday for little more than a light workout and lunch together. Wednesday saw a more normal practice and Thursday ""was very focused on playing the Trail Blazers and executing some of the things we need to do to prepare for them."" 'Do the job' The Lakers have won 16 NBA championships, one shy of the record held by the Boston Celtics. But they have endured 6 straight losing seasons since their last playoff appearance, including the final 3 campaigns of Bryant's career. This season, with James and the newly arrived Anthony Davis, the Lakers lead the Western Conference with the second-best record in the NBA, at 36-10. ""Our whole belief since I got here is that we're just going to put our head down and do the job,"" Vogel said. ""That really hasn't been any different the last two days."" However, it will be an emotional night at Staples Center, where the Lakers will honor Bryant's memory. Vogel said he'd been briefed on the plans, but the club is not revealing them beforehand. ""I'm going to let that all play out tomorrow night,"" he said, acknowledging that whatever tributes are planned will make the night more difficult. ""But we shouldn't do it any other way,"" he said. ""It's the right thing to do and an important night for our franchise and Laker Nation."" – Rappler.com  "

Photo by Mau Victa/Rappler BAGUIO CITY, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – Mayor Benjamin Magalong announced on Friday, January 31, that all big public activities in Baguio would be cancelled due to the threat caused by the novel coronavirus. These include the following: Magalong said small events like weddings, conferences, and others would still push through. The mayor said he would still see if the Panagbenga street and float parades on February 29 and March 1 would push through. “The tourism revenues are the least of my concerns. My main priorities are the health of my constituents,” Magalong said. He said that the decision to cancel these events was reached after a meeting Friday morning with health authorities and members of the Baguio Flower Festival Foundation. He said that the cancellation of the Panagbenga opening parade would not mean the suspension of classes in the college level. The city earlier cancelled classes in the elementary and high school on Saturday in anticipation of the parade. The opening parade was supposed to choose those who would perform in the finale of the Panagbenga streetdance and drum and lyre band performance on February 29. That and the float parade on March 1 will still be deliberated on. Magalong said that the CARAA, which will have 7,000 athletes from all over the region, was postponed and will be held during the summer. “We don’t want to send the wrong message. Tourists are still welcome,” he said. Kennon Road will still be partially opened on the weekends on February, he said. The Philippine Military Academy will be closed to the general public in the next 3 weeks, according to PMA superintendent Vice Admiral Allan Cusi. Only relatives of cadets can visit on weekends. The PMA has yet to decide on whether the reunion usually set after Valentine's Day will push through. Meanwhile, an online petition launched Thursday night to cancel the Panagbenga events altogether has gained steam among residents. As of Friday, the petition has garnered more than 15,000 signatures on change.org. Merely four hours after the petition’s posting online on Thursday, 4,500 people already provided their signatures. The petition, addressed to Magalong, the Baguio Flower Festival Foundation, and all other involved bodies, claims that with the confirmation of a single case of nCov, continuing to hold the Panagbenga festival is a health risk. “Life is much more precious than money.

US President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the Hispanic Heritage Month Reception at the White House in Washington, DC, September 27, 2019. Photo by Jim Watson/AFP WASHINGTON, USA – President Donald Trump's hopes for a speedy acquittal by the Senate received a boost on Thursday, January 30 as Democrats suffered a setback in their efforts to introduce new witnesses at his impeachment trial. (READ: Democrats warn of 'lawless' president in Trump impeachment arguments) Democrats had sought to have Trump's former national security advisor John Bolton testify but a key Republican senator said he would vote ""no"" when the question of calling further witnesses is put to the Senate on Friday, January 31. If the witness motion is rejected, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a key Trump ally, could conceivably call for a vote to acquit the president of the impeachment charges as soon as Friday. A two-thirds majority – or 67 senators – is needed to remove a president from office, and the 53-47 Republican majority in the Senate means Trump is virtually certain to be acquitted. Democrats were particularly eager to hear from Bolton following reports that he claims in an upcoming book to have been personally told by Trump that military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating his Democratic rival Joe Biden. The charge is at the heart of the December 18 impeachment of the 45th US president for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives. Four Republican votes are needed to allow new witnesses but Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who had been considered a possible swing vote, issued a statement late Thursday, January 30 saying there was no need for more evidence. ""It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation,"" Alexander said. ""But the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year's ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate,"" he said. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she would support the call for witnesses, and Utah Senator Mitt Romney has said he was ""very likely"" to do so. Another wavering Republican – Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – has said she will announce her decision Friday morning. In the event of a 50-50 tie, US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could be called upon to end the deadlock. If he declines to vote, the motion calling for witnesses would fail. 'Purely partisan impeachment' Chief Democratic prosecutor Adam Schiff, in a last-ditch bid on Thursday to win over Republican senators wary of a drawn-out process, proposed a one-week time frame to secure new witness testimony. ""Let's have a reasonable accommodation here,"" the California lawmaker told the 100 senators sitting as jurors at the historic trial. ""We'll take one week, and you'll continue with the business of the Senate."" Trump's defense team rejected the Democratic calls for more witnesses. ""They said for weeks it was an overwhelming case,"" said White House deputy counsel Patrick Philbin. ""If that's their position, why do they need more witnesses?"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone argued for an early acquittal, saying it ""would be the best thing for our country."" ""We're dealing with a purely partisan impeachment,"" Cipollone said, accusing Democrats of using impeachment ""as a political weapon."" Voters – not the Senate – should decide Trump's fate in the November presidential election, he said. Cipollone and Schiff made their remarks during an occasionally testy Senate session during which Democratic and Republican senators directed questions to the House prosecutors and White House defense team. House impeachment managers expressed outrage over an assertion by one of Trump's lawyers, Harvard professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, that a president can do almost anything he wants if he believes his re-election was ""in the public interest.""

The only problem was she was not sure which, among the many programs available, should she choose. But when she entered senior high school and got to know more about her options, she realized she wanted to become a medical technologist. For Nicole, there’s a certain beauty in this career that can’t be found in any of the other health allied programs “It is a balance of both theoretical and practical skills which always makes learning dynamic and engaging. Moreover, medical technologists are very important members of the hospital because they provide the test results that serve as the basis for a doctor’s diagnosis. Hence, providing the patient with the right treatment is highly dependent on how well a medical technologist performs his or her job. This is why I have so much respect for what medical technologists do, and it would make me extremely proud to call myself one as well in the future,” she said.

That’s what Owen Paul Tagarda is currently doing. He works as a medical technologist at Damulog Municipal Health Office. Owen said that the scholarship program became his advantage in finding a job as it’s widely acknowledged by medical institutions. “The program enabled me to become the person and public servant I am today in our municipality – an active advocate for health,” he said. Another notable Safeguard and PAMET scholarship graduate is Ernesto Nistal Quider.

The Philippine Band of Mercy (PBM) will inaugurate its 4-story Medical Building in East Avenue, Quezon City, on Thursday, February 20, in line with its vision to become the lead provider of comprehensive medical services for children born with craniofacial and other physical impairments. Events lined up for the occasion include a late afternoon mass, ribbon cuttings, and dinner for all invited guests, members of the Board of Trustees, and the staff and management of the foundation. Topping the guest list are Senator Win Gatchalian and Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte. PBM’s new medical building is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities, which include 5operating rooms, recovery rooms, sterilizing rooms, a doctors’ lounge, a nurse station, an events hall, and meeting rooms. It is replete with a well-designed sewage treatment plant and standby generator. The new structure has been designed to accommodate the expansion of PBM’s ambulatory surgical programs for cleft lip and palate, clubfoot, hernia, and other congenital problems. “Our dream is really for this building to be of service to many, many Filipinos, especially the poor,” says Bob Mirani, current chair and president of the PBM Board. “PBM has quietly aided thousands of children in the last 82 years. We want to remain relevant and useful in the next 82 and beyond.” PBM’s current flagship programs are surgeries for cleft lip and palate, and clubfoot. Every year, 4,000 Filipinos are born with cleft lips and palates, and 3,000 with clubfoot. In 2019, PBM served 2,000 children with cleft lifts and palates and 650 children with clubfoot.     At the inaugural, the Board will give special recognition to PBM’s outstanding partners for the last several years, which include Smile Train, Mabuhay Shriners, the Gatchalian family, the City Government of Valenzuela, and the Provincial Government of Bulacan. Two outstanding partner doctors would also be honored. PBM was founded in 1937 by American war veteran Irving “Daddy” S. Hart, who discovered during his stay in the Philippines that there were many young children who needed medical-surgical intervention because of their congenital impairments. Three former Philippine presidents and their spouses took an active part in PBM’s activities in the earlier years: Ramon Magsaysay, Carlos Garcia, and Ferdinand Marcos. The present meeting room at the medical building houses some of the accolades PBM received through the years, including one from President Marcos recognizing PBM’s active role in the celebration of the International Year of the Child in 1979. – Rappler.com  "

A tip from a witness led police to the discovery of the body of Mario Buendia Martel in a vacant lot in Sitio Banaba, Barangay Guinsay, Danao City. Danao City police said it was the victim's father Eugenio Laurel Martel, who helped identify the body. Master Sergeant Jose Michael Alegado, desk officer of Danao City police office, said the father reported that the 34-year-old Martel, 34, a resident of Sitio Kabayabsan, Barangay Cambanay, Danao City was missing. The father told police that his son left their home around 9 pm on January 25 and never returned. Alegado said it was still early for the police to conclude if the body had fatal wounds because it was decaying when they found it. However, Alegado said residents in the area told the police that they heard several gunshots on Monday, January 27. The witnesses though could not say where the shots came from. The father of the victim told police that Mario did not mention receiving any threats or if there was someone he was in conflict with.

In this file photo taken on January 22, 2020, passengers wear protective masks to protect against the spread of the Coronavirus as they arrive at the Los Angeles International Airport, California. Photo by Mark Ralston/AFP BEIJING, China – Countries are scrambling to airlift their citizens from the Chinese city of Wuhan as it struggles to get to grips with the spread of a SARS-like virus which has claimed more than 200 lives nationwide. The United States, France, and Japan are among nations that have already sent aircraft to remove their nationals. (READ: WHO declares international emergency over novel coronavirus) China has sealed off the city, effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Hubei province, including thousands of foreigners. (READ: China virus death toll hits 212 – health officials) AFP answers 5 questions on the evacuation efforts. What are the risks? Authorities will have to “really, really clean the airports and prevent transmission at every step of the logistics – it’s a huge risk”, said Wang Linfa, director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases program at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says the risk of contracting a disease on board a plane is in general similar to other confined, crowded spaces such as buses or trains. “That said, the risk on airplanes is probably lower than in many confined spaces because modern planes have cabin air filtration systems equipped with HEPA filters,” it adds. How are airlines preventing infection? Singaporean airline Scoot, which flew home 92 people to the Southeast Asian city-state on Thursday, January 30, provided surgical masks to all passengers and required its crew to wear the more effective N95 masks and surgical gloves. To limit physical interaction, food packs were left on seats before take-off and no meals or drinks were distributed in-flight. Scoot said temperature screening was conducted at check-in and again before boarding, and those with a fever were prevented from flying. Air India enforced similar measures in New Delhi's evacuation effort on Friday, January 31. “There are risks but on the other hand, the risks of leaving them at the epicenter of the global outbreak are significantly higher with the strain on resources there,” said Paul Tambyah, an infectious diseases expert at the National University of Singapore. International aviation agencies have protocols for evacuations that include having empty seats between passengers and ensuring good air quality and flow, he added. What about the foreigners left behind? Thousands of non-Chinese citizens remain trapped in Wuhan watching helplessly as others are flown home on government-chartered flights. Many left in the city have described an atmosphere of fear and confusion as well as uncertainty about food supply. Wuhan is a virtual ghost town, with restaurants and shops shuttered. “It’s unfortunate but citizens of countries that don’t have that kind of diplomatic wherewithal are going to have to deal with the situation that they’re presented with,” said China analyst Drew Thompson, a former US Department of Defense official. “They’re going to have to hunker down...and stay in contact with their embassies, and make do, just like their Chinese friends and counterparts.” What happens after they return home? Quarantine arrangements for evacuees vary from country to country. Japan’s policy of “self-quarantine” has sparked fierce criticism. Two of Wednesday's returnees initially refused to be tested for the virus although officials said the pair were later willing to be checked. “It’s a difficult scenario,” said Wang. “You just do your best to...educate the citizens, to say, 'we’ll help you to help us'.” “In most circumstances self-quarantine is more than enough if the citizen is educated.” In South Korea 18 passengers on an evacuation flight were immediately sent to hospital on arriving back in their country Friday after displaying symptoms of the coronavirus. How long is the quarantine period? French and British returnees will undergo a 14-day quarantine, while Americans will be voluntarily isolated for 3 days at a US airbase. The virus's incubation period, during which patients are infected but show no symptoms, is 2-17 days, meaning a two-week quarantine should catch about 99% of cases, said Wang. “It’s all about risk assessment,"" he said. ""There’s no such thing as a single quarantine (type) for all citizens in all countries coming from any part of the world.” – Rappler.com "

University of St La Salle's Romeo Teruel and Manuel de la Paz at a research conference in Bacolod City on January 30, 2020. Photo by Marchel Espina BACOLOD CITY, Philippines – A school, local government units, and other groups have stepped up efforts to sustain the Irrawaddy dolphin conservation in Negros Occidental. The core team, led by 6 study leaders, presented the results and recommendations of the Commission on Higher Education-funded research project, dubbed as “Sustainability of Marine Protected Areas for Irrawaddy dolphins in Negros Occidental,” at Sugarland Hotel here on Thursday, January 30. The core habitat of Irrawaddy dolphins, locally known as lumba-lumba, is located near the mouth of Bago River, the second largest river in Negros Island. (READ: A whale of a tale in Bais) According to the University of St La Salle research team, since Irrawaddy dolphins live very close to the shore they are constantly exposed to the coastal activities of communities. Among these threats are habitat degradation, heavy boat traffic, pollution, and possible entanglement in fishing gear. Romeo Teruel, USLS assistant vice chancellor for Research and Engagement, said the project was a collaboration of the school, the local governments of Bago and Pulupandan, Bago City College, and the Provincial Environment Management Office. , The project was carried out with a P14-million grant from CHED. He said they sent the proposal in 2016 and it underwent several reviews. A year later, they got the funding and started with the research. “The research is not very easy. That is why we really have to use the multisectoral approach and local government units will play an important role in this kind of research, especially that we are dealing with community members who have to know and accept that dolphins are important species to be conserved or to be protected,” Teruel explained. The community  initially had very low awareness about the importance and existence of Irrawaddy dolphins in Bago and Pulupandan, he said. “They don't know about the dolphins, so we really need to change their behavior,” Teruel said. Teruel said they intensified their information education campaign in the coastal communities, and distributed educational materials to the grassroots. Project components Manuel de la Paz, research associate of USLS Center for Research and Engagement, said the project involves 6 research components: dolphin research, water quality, fisheries, livelihood and environmental advocacy, project impact, and tourism potential. De la Paz, who led the research on the dolphin component, said there are about 12 Irrawaddy dolphins in the area. He said this was considered as “one of the smallest populations in the world.” He stressed the importance of cooperation among the two LGUs and their neighboring localities in the conservation efforts. “It is important because there may be interaction with people. Activities of the people are also affecting the dolphins.... We need to also manage the people who are sharing the habitat,” he said. De la Paz said that research includes recommendations to sustain conservation efforts in the marine protected area. “There will be areas that we hope will be left alone. So, of course, the fishermen will be affected. We did a study on what would be the possible alternative livelihood that we can provide to the fisherman because we are taking away their fishing grounds,” he said. Dolphin-watching not recommended De la Paz added they also investigated the potential of using Irrawaddy dolphins as form of tourism ambassadors for Bago and Pulupandan, which he did not recommend. “Although for my research, I did not recommend dolphin watching and they agreed. We don't want any more boats in the area because boat traffic is always a problem and a disturbance to their natural behavior,” De la Paz said. He said they were also looking to connect the project on the existing tourism programs of the LGUs. He said there was a change in the behavior of the community in terms of conservation. “At first, they were very against the marine protected area because it’s fishing grounds. Now, the fishermen themselves are rallying with us,” De la Paz said. He urged the public to help save the dolphins by using the “ecosystem approach.” Among these are avoid throwing plastics and other toxic wastes into the sea, support local legislation on establishing marine protected areas, preserve mangrove habitats, and pressure the government to put high consideration on the dolphin habitat when planning for the Negros-Guimaras Bridge. De la Paz said the bridge will most probably affect the dolphins because it is their core habitat, and there are dugongs at the other side of the island “We just hope this kind of information is considered during the planning process because that will affect our endangered wildlife and it would be irresponsible not to consider that,” he stressed. – Rappler.com "

While some resolve to be healthier by eating more vegetables or exercising more, I've decided to be a better friend. It’s not because I’ve managed to eat healthier or achieved my #bodygoals. It’s because I believe that being a good friend is the key to a happier life. Friendships are one of the hardest relationships to nurture. They’re the first ones to get completely forgotten when our lives start to get busy. It starts with a series of messages left on read and before long, you’ll notice they’ve stopped asking how you’re doing or if you’re down for an inuman. It’s embarrassing to admit but even though I live close to my childhood friend, I’d say no whenever she would ask me to hang out. Partly because I was tired of her whining about her boyfriend. I kept on seen zoning her for months until she no longer messaged me. It wasn’t until the Christmas break that I realized how much we’ve grown apart. I checked her Facebook page and it was full of photos from her vacation and night outs with a new barkada. I tried reaching out to her but it’s been hard finding a common schedule. I haven’t given up and I’m hopeful that she still wants to reconnect, but looking back, if only I had the patience and willingness to listen to my friend who has once helped me get through a tough time in my life, things wouldn't be this difficult. In San Mig Light’s ‘Mga Panira ng Usapan’ series, these are the things they talk about. The videos aim to make people realize the importance of knowing how to listen and learning how to be a good friend. One of these is by being aware of habits we should avoid, such as being a panira ng usapan. An example of being a panira ng usapan is a hijacker or someone who likes hogging conversations and interrupting people while they’re speaking. Being a good friend doesn't stop at being present in all of your get-togethers. You also have to be conscious of how you behave around them. Give your friends the chance to talk. Wait until they’re finished before taking your turn. And before you even start talking, make sure that what you’re going to say is only going to add value to your conversation. So, for those like me who often go MIA and don't have the patience to listen, I’d like to tell you that being a better friend can do more for you than adapting to strict diets and excessive (and expensive) exercise plans. Having good friends is the best way to add happy years to your life. – Rappler.com  SAN MIG LIGHT is the light beer that lets you enjoy interesting conversations over extended drinking moments.

The 14-year-old Eala is the first Filipino to win a juniors Grand Slam since 2009 when Francis Casey Alcantara also captured the Australian Open boys doubles title with Hsieh Cheng-peng of Chinese Taipei. Fresh from upsetting the top-ranked pair of Latvia's Kamila Bartone and Czech Republic's Linda Fruhvirtova, Eala and Nugroho rode on their winning momentum as they cruised to a 5-0 lead in the opening set. Falker and Mutavdzic were able to fight back due to the Southeast Asians' unforced errors, but the winning pair managed to bounce back and take the 1-0 lead in the match. As the Europeans started to build on a momentum, Eala and Nugroho closed out the match with 3 straight games. Both Eala and Nugroho redeemed themselves from their singles exit in the 3rd round on Wednesday, January 29. Still, Eala recorded her best singles finish in a junior Grand Slam by reaching the 3rd round.

Mighty Sports Philippines and Morocco’s AS Sale fight for a championship berth in the knockout semifinal on Friday, January 31 at 7 pm in Dubai (11 pm, Philippine time) Like the Philippine team, AS Sale has a handful of reliable scorers, as proven by 4 out of 5 players reaching double-digit scoring in the crucial UAE win. However, lying hidden behind a strong starting 5 is actually a very thin AS Sale bench, with little to no minutes being given to them throughout the tournament. Just from the UAE game alone, AS Sale had 3 players clock in a full 40-minute marathon on the court, which says all there is to be said about their depth. Meanwhile, this has never happened to any player on Tiu’s team, not even Balkman and Blatche.

955,250685,"January 31, 2020",Food,Vegan meals and awards shows: Hollywood red carpets go green,Agence France-Presse,"Following the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild awards' vegan move, the 2020 Oscars ceremony's menu for the night will be '70% plant-based'   LOS ANGELES, USA – From glitzy all-vegan galas to recycled red carpet outfits, Hollywood has stepped up efforts to reduce its carbon footprint this awards season, which will soon wrap up with the Oscars. But while some scientists have welcomed A-listers' renewed zeal on climate change, others have questioned whether Tinseltown's jet-set elite are any sort of example to follow. The Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, and Critics' Choice Awards galas this month all served plant-based menus, instead of the steak dinners typical of celebrity-packed events. Oscar nominees were offered roasted maitake mushrooms and vegan cheese at their annual luncheon this week, and will be served a ""70%"" menu at the February 9 show. The ""brave and compassionate"" moves have drawn glowing praise from actor Joaquin Phoenix, who said it was the first time he'd ever eaten at the Globes, as well as environmental actor-activist stalwarts Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. Inside the star-studded events, few had any complaints – even if comedian Seth Meyers wryly observed it was lucky that ""food critics"" weren't invited to the Critics' Choice Awards. Climate scientists and activists have also welcomed the trend. Brenda Ekwurzel, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said it was ""really important for Hollywood"" to make an effort and ""very exciting to me as a climate scientist."" Convincing people to change their food choices is one of the best ways to immediately reduce carbon emissions, she added. Switching the diet of 1,500 guests at the Globes would have reduced the event's footprint roughly tenfold –saving 10 to 15 tons of CO2 equivalents – according to climate scientist Peter Kalmus. By contrast, an average person in Bangladesh generates about one ton per year. The ""ripple effects"" of even one famous attendee taking up climate activism as a result could have far greater benefits, influencing public awareness and even policy, Kalmus added. 'Walk the talk' The highly publicized steps taken by Hollywood have not however drawn universal praise. Few winners and presenters approached the mic at the Globes without offering ""thoughts and prayers"" expressed for those suffering in Australia's wildfires, while singer Lizzo recently helped pack food hampers for those affected during her world tour. But accusations of hypocrisy have been leveled at many showbiz stars, with the movie industry as a whole decamping each year to a string of globe-trotting festivals spanning the globe from Cannes to Venice to Toronto to Park City, Utah. ""It is problematic to speak out on the climate emergency if you're flying on private jets"" and have a huge overall climate footprint, said Kalmus. While anyone – with or without a celebrity platform – raising awareness about climate issues should be welcomed, it is those who ""walk the talk"" who have the biggest impact, he added. Kalmus singled out for praise Australian actress Yael Stone (Orange is the New Black), who this month pledged to give up her US acting career because ""it's unethical for us to set up a life in two countries, knowing what we know."" ""It's not about keeping those direct emissions from those flights out of the atmosphere,"" said Kalmus, estimating two first-class round trips per year at between 12-24 tons of CO2. ""Putting the planet above your career"" makes a highly public statement that climate change ""is indeed an emergency,"" he added. Lost in the wash According to Ekwurzel, celebrity actors would be most effective if they were to insist on reducing the carbon footprints of gas-guzzling movie productions. ""People who have resources, like those at the Golden Globes, have the most economic power to reduce their high emissions,"" she noted. Ekwurzel pointed to renewable electricity usage on film sets as one way to improve the status quo, while singling out transportation and packaging used in movie catering as problematic. Ultimately, the measures available to Hollywood celebrities are very different to those facing the public. ""When there are thousands of ways we individually can reduce emissions, picking one and getting on a pulpit saying 'this is the way everyone has to do it' will never work,"" she said. And however well-meaning, some of those celebrities' efforts may simply be lost in the wash. Fashion designer Stella McCartney tweeted her delight at Phoenix's decision to wear the same tuxedo – one of hers – ""for the entire award season to reduce waste."" The move drew a mocking response from some, including Globes host Ricky Gervais, who responded: ""That's nothing. I darn my own socks and you should see the state of my... underpants."" Asked to quantify the carbon emissions impact of Phoenix's thrifty wardrobe, Kalmus admitted it was ""tough for a T-shirt-and-jeans-wearing scientist"" but concluded: ""I'm going to go with zero."" – Rappler.com "
956,250686,"February 01, 2020",Tech News,PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X: What we know so far,Kyle Chua,"The console wars resume as the PS5 and the Xbox Series X loom on the horizon. Here's what we know so far Logo images from their respective manufacturers Logo images from their respective manufacturers This article originally appeared on the tech and video game site Solid State Now. We’re running down everything that has been revealed so far about Sony and Microsoft’s next-gen consoles. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are nearing the inevitable end of their lifespans as Sony and Microsoft are once again gearing up to launch a new generation of consoles sometime this year. Both companies have been teasing us with tidbits of information about their respective next-gen systems since they were officially announced in early 2019. While loads of details are still kept under wraps, what has been revealed is enough to give us some idea of how the consoles are shaping up so far. So we’re unpacking everything we know here. Name Microsoft revealed at The Game Awards last December that its upcoming console is called “Xbox Series X” – a name that was criticized for being confusing. The company later clarified that its next-gen line is actually just called “Xbox” and “Series X” is the name of the model. ""The name we're carrying forward to the next generation is simply Xbox,"" a Microsoft representative told Business Insider. ""And at The Game Awards you saw that name come to life through the Xbox Series X."" This seemingly hints that there will be other models aside from the “Series X” that will be released under this rebranded “Xbox” name banner. Meanwhile, Sony announced that its next-gen console will be called “PlayStation 5”, or PS5, for short, as many expected. The company has been using the same naming scheme since it launched the PlayStation 1 back in 1995. Specs Going by what we currently know about the two consoles, the PS5 and Xbox Series X are not going to be much different from each other when it comes to their graphics rendering and processing capabilities. Both machines will be housing AMD’s third generation of Ryzen processors, which features the new Zen 2 architecture, and Navi graphics cards. AMD’s hardware supports ray tracing – a rendering technique that pushes realistic lighting and effects in real time. Ray tracing is being touted as the next big thing in gaming graphics, and there are already a number of games out now that support it. The caveat is that only the most modern and expensive graphics cards can handle the technology efficiently. But, the release of these next-generation consoles will likely lower the price barrier for this technology and make it more accessible to a wider range of players. Another key hardware component that will be packed inside both systems is a solid-state drive (SSD) for storage. The biggest advantage it has over hard disk drives (HDD) from previous console generations is that it can improve overall performance of the system and significantly reduce loading times for games. For instance, according to WIRED, it only took 0.8 seconds for a PS5 dev kit to load a new area of Manhattan in the PS4 game Spider-Man compared to 15 seconds it took the PS4 Pro. The exact capacity of the SSD that will ship with the two consoles has not been revealed. Both machines will reportedly output up to 8K resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate. In comparison, the PS4 Pro and the Xbox One X only pushed resolutions up to 4K. 8K is said to be four times the overall pixels of 4K. Both the PS5 and Xbox Series X will also come with optical drives for reading discs. Sony confirmed that the PS5’s optical drive will support 4K Blu-Ray discs, allowing the console to double as a media player. Features Arguably the most talked about feature coming to both the PS5 and Xbox Series X is backward compatibility. Yes, both Sony and Microsoft confirmed that their new machines can play games from previous console generations, but it’s not entirely clear yet how the feature will work and what games will be supported. ""We wanted to make sure we had that, day one, we could deliver on the compatibility promise, and so I've been playing quite a few [Xbox 360] games on my [Xbox Series X] and Xbox One games on the [Xbox Series X] and that's just to ensure that we can be there day one,"" Xbox executive Phil Spencer said in an interview with GameSpot. This confirms that Microsoft expects the feature to be available at launch, but to what extent has yet to be announced. Microsoft is also planning to integrate its cloud gaming service, Project xCloud, to its game subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, sometime this year. This will give you the ability to stream the company’s growing catalog of games direct from the cloud. Spencer said that the Xbox Series X was designed with cloud-based streaming in mind, seemingly confirming that the system will have features that take advantage of Microsoft’s cloud gaming services. Sony, meanwhile, promised that the PS5 will be backward compatible with PS4 games and the PSVR headset, but has yet to talk about support for other console generations and when these features will be available. Sony also touted that the PS5 will ship with a new controller that supports haptic feedback. What this does is give you distinct tactile experiences depending on what you’re experiencing in your game. This means walking on grass, for instance, will feel very different from wading through mud. In addition, the PS5’s controller will feature adaptive L2 and R2 triggers, allowing developers to tweak and customize its resistance. This will reportedly make firing a gun feel different as, say, firing a bow. The Xbox Series X controller, on the other hand, will be getting a dedicated share button, which you can use to share screenshots and videos with your friends. It will also be slightly smaller than the Xbox One controller. The PS5 will reportedly also come with a feature that lets you decide which game modes to install first. For example, you can choose to only install the multiplayer mode of a game if you don’t wish to play through the single-player mode. This not only saves up space in the console’s storage but can also possibly lessen the time it takes to install games. It’s not clear as of yet whether the Xbox Series X will have a similar feature. Games We have no doubt that Sony and Microsoft are working hard to create a launch lineup that will make us all want to shell out some cash to get their respective systems on day one. The first confirmed title launching alongside the PS5 is Godfall created by Counterplay Games, a 75-person studio comprised of developers that worked on games such as God of War, Destiny 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Diablo III, and Gears 5, and will be published by Borderlands developer Gearbox Studios. Counterplay Games CEO Kevin Lee describes the game as a looter-slasher, a new genre that combines the progression of loot-focused RPGs like Borderlands and Diablo with the third-person melee combat of God of War. Check out the teaser for the game below: There have also been rumors that Sony could be launching some of their first-party titles slated for release in 2020 for both the PS4 and PS5, but these have yet to be confirmed. Some of the rumored titles include The Last of Us: Part II and Ghosts of Tsushima. Microsoft, meanwhile, revealed that the Xbox Series X will not have first-party titles that are exclusive to the system at launch as the company doesn’t want its PC and Xbox One fans to be left in the dust. “As our content comes out over the next year, two years, all of our games, sort of like PC, will play up and down that family of devices,” Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty explained to MCV. “We want to make sure that if someone invests in Xbox between now and [Series X] that they feel that they made a good investment and that we’re committed to them with content.” For example Halo Infinite, the sixth main entry in the longstanding Halo franchise, will launch for PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X sometimes in 2020. However, the Xbox Series X will likely have an edge over the Xbox One when it comes to the game’s performance and graphics. It was announced that the game will be running on developer 343 Industries’ Slipspace Engine – an engine designed to bring the classic Halo feel back with some flashy new visuals.  At The Game Awards, Microsoft also showcased an in-engine trailer for Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2, a sequel to Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice. The game is being developed by Ninja Theory – a studio Microsoft acquired in 2018. Ubisoft announced that five of their titles will launch for both the current and next generation of consoles in 2020. These include Watchdogs: Legion, Rainbow Six Quarantine, Gods & Monsters, and two other titles that have yet to be revealed.  Release window Both Sony and Microsoft announced that their respective consoles will hit store shelves by the holiday season of this year. We’re predicting that the launch of the 2 will not be far apart from each other – likely to be sometime between October and November. – Rappler.com "

Leoncio Seña, 62, begs on the streets of Barangay San Guillermo in Talisay, Batangas in the wake of the Taal Volcano eruption. Photo by Mara Cepeda/Rappler BATANGAS, Philippines – The road in Barangay San Guillermo in Talisay, Batangas still has a thick layer of volcanic ash, but 62-year-old Leoncio Seña would sit outside for hours. In his hands was a red dipper, which he held out to any passing vehicle whose driver would be kind enough to give him a few pesos. Seña told Rappler on Friday, January 31, that he and his family have been begging on the street for about week now. They evacuated to this barangay, where one of his in-laws lives, after fleeing their lakeside home in Talisay when Taal Volcano began erupting. “Wala nga ho kaming pinansyal. Gaya ngayon, may sakit pa ‘yong dalawa kong apo. Walang magastos. Hindi madala sa ospital. Eh ‘yun nga, nagbabakasakali may magdo-donate,” said Seña, who only had a surgical mask – not the prescribed N95 mask – to protect his lungs from the ash. (We don't have any finances. We need it especially now that two of my grandchildren are sick. But we don't have any money. We can't send them to the hospital. We're now hoping someone would donate to us.) Those who would stop for Seña tend to only give coins or small bills. (READ: Taal Volcano evacuees appeal: ‘We need cash aid’) He said the evacuees here would pool together the little amount they collected at the end of the day, then divide it among themselves to buy food. Others use the money for their transportation fare to visit individuals or offices where they could ask for more cash or relief goods. “Wala, barya-barya lang ho. May nagbibigay ng P5, ganyan. ‘Di naman ho kalakihan ang binibigay. Nagpapasalamat na rin ho,” Seña said. (It's not much, just a few coins. Some give P5. They don't give a lot. But we're still thankful.)  'PANG-TUBIG LANG PO.' Barangay San Guillermo resident Marlon Rosima asks for water from passing vehicles on January 31, 2020. Photo by Mara Cepeda/Rappler Several meters from Seña’s monobloc chair was Marlon Rosima, who was holding up a cardboard sign that read, “Pang-tubig lang po (Just for water)! Thank you!” The 36-year-old resident said it’s been 3 months since their village lost their water supply, the lack of access compounded by Taal's eruption. “Bago pa po pumutok ang bulkan, talagang wala na po kaming tubig. Tatlong buwan na po. Kaya ang hinanaing po namin dito, talagang tubig po ang kailangan namin dito,” Rosima said. (Even before the volcano erupted, we really did not have water anymore. It's been 3 months. That's why our lament here is that water is what we really need here.) Some drivers would open their windows and give them bottles of drinking water. But this meager supply is not enough for bathing as well as washing their clothes and cookware. Rosima said they do have the option to buy water in Tagaytay, but it costs them P750 for every 5 drums. “Ang hirap po ng ano dito eh. P750 ‘yong paigib dito [ng 5 drum]. Eh saan po kami kukuha ng P750? Hindi lang naman isang beses kami gagamit ng tubig,” said Rosima. (Water supply is so hard to get here. It costs us P750 to fill up 5 drums]. But where are we going to get P750? We're using water more than once a day.) Rosima used to be a construction worker before Taal's eruption. He has yet to find alternative work. Where is the Talisay government? Sought for comment, Talisay Mayor Gerry Natanauan said they cannot just stop residents from begging. He then said there is no shortage of help arriving in Barangay San Guillermo anyway. ""Alam po ninyo, hindi po mawawala ‘yan na mga ganyan kasi ‘yan po ay opportunity sa mga ganyang panahon (You know, these cases tend to happen because it's an opportunity in times like this),"" Natanauan told Rappler. “Ako sa pagkakaalam ko po, hindi po mawawalan sila ng nakakarating sa kanila. Dahil unang-una, ‘yung mga taong tumutulong na taga-labas ay napakaraming dumadaan sa kanila. Nakikita ko kung paano sila nakapila at binibigyan,” Natanauan said. (As far as I know, there's no lack of help reaching them. Because first of all, outsiders who send help would pass by them. I've seen for myself how they would line up and receive the aid.) He acknowledged the flow of water in the village has been weak, a longtime problem in San Guillermo since its supply is sourced upland in Tagaytay. “Hindi naman po nawawalan eh. Mayroon naman lagi eh. Hindi naman mabubuhay na walang tubig. May tubig sila. Sabi lang nila wala. Bagamat mahina ‘yong daloy, mayroon naman po silang nakukunan, nagsu-supply sa kanila,” the mayor said. (They never run out of supply. There's always a supply there. They wouldn't be alive if there's no water. They have water. They're just saying they don't. Even if the flow is weak, they still have somewhere else to source water from.)  THE MAYOR.

(READ: Batangas mayors say time to change how they respond to disasters) (We're still fixing it. Of course you can't just rush that. First of all, it's hard to determine which to attend to first.

For now, Natanauan said residents who want to avail of the province’s cash-for-work program should go to his municipal office, about 5 kilometers away from the homes of Seña and Rosima in San Guillermo. Every participant will get P400 a day for helping clean ash from the streets. The mayor said Talisay has already received P5-million worth of aid from the national government. Other local government units have been sending cash and relief goods as well, including Bulacan and Nueva Ecija.

The credibility of Philippine democracy and the balance between the different powers is at stake.” ABS-CBN's legislative franchise expires on March 30. It first applied for a franchise renewal in 2014, which led to the submision of House Bill 4349 on November 10, 2016. Since then, 8 more bills have been proposed, none of which have been voted on by Congress. The renewal has been strongly opposed by President Rodrigo Duterte, who accused the network of not running advertisements he paid for in during the 2016 presidential campaign. On December 30, 2019, Duterte said that it's unlikely for the franchise to be renewed adn that the network should be sold instead. In the past, he also accused the network of “publishing trash,” trying to “swindle” him, and of being “sons of bitches.” Various groups said Duterte's bashing of the network is part of his moves to silence journalists. The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines has launched a petition for the renewal of the franchise.

WHO Philippines was responding to our question about the impact of water scarcity, particularly in Cebu, on efforts to combat an outbreak of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.    The Department of Health also recommends frequent hand washing and “good hygiene” to combat the spread of the virus. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) “It is important that communities and health workers have access to safe and adequate water at all times to protect them from the spread of infection,” the WHO said.Water crisisSince the mid-2000s, however, Metro Cebu, an area where over 2.5 million people live, has been grappling with prolonged rotating water interruptions.   Periods of no water flow can last longer hours and affect more barangays going into the summer months, when there is little to no rainfall.  But even during the most recent rainy season, barangays across Metro Cebu experienced long water interruptions in their homes.  A resident of Barangay Kamputhaw in Cebu City told Rappler through direct message that the village often only gets water between 12 am and 5 am daily, but sometimes for less time than that.  Cebu City resident Jann Banguis sent a video to Rappler of Kamputhaw residents lining up with buckets to get water from a truck. Sige na lang ta ani, MCWD?#CebuWaterCrisis pic.twitter.com/mXHYvt2QMk JM dela Mer of San Isidro, Talisay City, said his barangay currently only gets water from 4 am to 6 am daily.A resident of Barangay Luz in Cebu City reported not having water flow entirely since Thursday, January 30.  The WHO said lack of water would threaten infection prevention and control measures and “will have an impact on health.”   In the summer of 2019, over 30 barangays in Metro Cebu experienced up to 22-hour water outages because both the Jaclupan and Buhisan dams in Metro Cebu had completely dried up. (READ: 22-hour water interruptions expected as Jaclupan dam dries up)  Mayor Edgar Labella met with heads of regional government agencies on Friday to assist the city in planning its response to a potential outbreak.   Much of the discussion was focused on the quarantine of possible virus carriers, making sure hospitals were equipped to deal with patients infected by the virus, and the supply of masks.  Multiple attempts to reach Labella to ask if water distribution or sanitizer supply plans were part of the discussion went unanswered. But he is scheduled to discuss the water crisis in a public forum at the Cebu City Sports Complex on Monday, February 3. More water sources to open In January alone, the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) announced 15 separate water interruptions for different barangays. MCWD spokesperson Charmaine Kara Rodriguez said the supply deficit is currently at 10,000 cubic meters per day, with a total production of 223,000 cubic meters per day. The total demand for water in Metro Cebu was an average of 500,000 cubic meters.   “Supply problems were experienced this month in areas due to leaks, non-operation of wells due to power outages, and maintenance of MCWD facilities,” Kara explained. She said, however, that new wells scheduled to open in February and March should help add to the daily output of water production.   Additional water supply from Pilipinas Water Resources Incorporated in Mambaling is expected to add 5,000 cubic meters per day, while water sourced from Danao City is expected to add an additional 10,000 cubic meters per day.  But even with the additional sources of water, the supply would still be producing only 47% of total water demand in Metro Cebu. The MCWD, however, acknowledged that the amount of rainfall that will come in the summer months to replenish the water supply in the Buhisan and Jaclupan dams is unpredictable. While they recognized the important of water in combating the spread of viruses, they still encouraged the public to practice water conservation in their homes. “MCWD is advising the public to use water wisely so everyone can enjoy it. Let’s conserve where we can so we will have enough supply even during the summer months.” Kara said. From 2016 to 2019, Cebu City and the Province of Cebu had declared a state of calamity on diffent occasions due to drought, brought about by El Niño.  When water supply is low, the MCWD said they could deliver water to barangays where there is no service. The water district spokesperson said coordination for water deliveries would be done through the barangays and local government units.The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency. The death is currently at 212 as of Friday. After the first case of nCoV-2019 was confirmed in the Philippines – a woman who traveled to Manila via Cebu and Dumaguete – President Rodrigo Duterte imposed a ban on travelers from the Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak. The ban includes flights from the rest of Hubei province, China. This would last until the 2019-nCoV threat was over. – Rappler.com "

969,250700,"February 01, 2020",Philippines,"Through his own lens: Albert Garcia gets up close with Pinatubo, Taal",Bonz Magsambol,"Rappler talks to award-winning photojournalist Albert Garcia about covering the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo and Taal Volcano  ICONIC PHOTO. Photojournalist Albert Garcia's snap of Mount Pinatubo eruption is in National Geographic's ""100 Best Images of All Time."" Photo by Albert Garcia MANILA, Philippines – It wasn’t a lucky shot. When he covered the eruption of Mount Pinatubo on June 15, 1991, photojournalist Albert Garcia badly wanted his photos to be remarkable and to end up somewhere. He wasn't disappointed. That photo of the cataclysmic eruption taken while he was at the back of a pickup truck driving at breakneck speed away from the explosion won first place in the 1992 World Press Photo Competition in Amsterdam. It was also hailed by the National Geographic and Time Magazine as among the greatest of all time. But beyond the iconic photo, Garcia shared with Rappler his experience covering the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo in Zambales and Taal Volcano in Batangas. While both eruptions happened in the afternoon, people in Batangas were calmer than the people in Zambales, according to Garcia. “I sensed more fear in people when Pinatubo erupted. Unlike in Taal, I didn’t quite feel it. Maybe because they are more familiar with the area. Hours after Pinatubo erupted, you can see that people were anxious and afraid,” Garcia said. Fast information is crucial Garcia said that unlike the Pinatubo eruption, people knew what to do when Taal Volcano started erupting on Sunday afternoon, January 12. They were tuned in to the blow-by-blow updates of news organizations on social media about the situation in Taal.  That information enabled them to safely evacuate from the island. (READ: Two-time Taal eruption survivor: Access to information saved lives in 2020) “People get information faster now. Unlike in Pinatubo, there was no Facebook, no Twitter. People can easily gather information now. Maybe Facebook – social media – is a big factor,” Garcia said. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) had been monitoring Taal Volcano since it began erupting. Phivolcs uses two networks to monitor volcanic earthquakes – the Philippine Seismic Network which covers the whole country, and the Taal Volcano Network, which includes small earthquakes undetected by the former. (READ: LIST: Where to get official, reliable info on Taal Volcano eruption) Garcia said scant information during the Pinatubo eruption nearly 3 decades ago was a problem at that time. “We just relied on the radio and the newspaper. The flow of information during that time was so slow. We had to rely on Phivolcs for updates,” Garcia said. People were anxious and scared when pyroclastic materials hurtled into the air towards them. “Everybody screamed because ashfall was approaching us,” he recalled. According to Phivolcs, Mount Pinatubo ejected an eruption column 40 kilometers above its crater. The volcano then started ejecting volcanic materials such as ashes, lava, and rocks. Earthquakes and steam explosions were also felt. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo was considered the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. (READ: Looking back: When Mount Pinatubo blew its top) The danger of social media Not doubt social media has provided quick information during disasters, enabling people to plan their actions. However, the sheer volume of content on the platforms makes it difficult for some to determine what is or is not factual information. (READ: FACT CHECK: False alerts, warnings over Taal Volcano eruption) Garcia said there is a danger when people believe everything they see online.“Fears worsen because of disinformation,” he said. “People feared the wrong information they saw online, and they also feared the right information,” he continued. Call of duty Garcia recalled what was going through his head when super hot pyroclastic materials spewed by Mount Pinatubo flew towards them, forcing him and other journalists to evacuate the vicinity of the raging volcano. “During that time, I prayed. I hoped that it wasn’t my time yet, because my children were still young. Just give me one beautiful shot. Just one shot,” he said. Later, he recalled how relieved he was when he looked at his photo and saw how beautiful it was. “I was happy because it was beautiful. I saw how big the cloud was – its sheer enormousness,” Garcia said. While he feared for his safety as he covered disasters, Garcia would always be reminded of the importance of his profession. “I want to tell stories through photos. I went there to do what I want to do – to take beautiful photos and tell stories,” Garcia said. – Rappler.com *Video by Franz Lopez "

972,250704,"February 01, 2020",IMHO,[OPINION] Hate and xenophobia have no place in the coronavirus outbreak,Marshal Murillo,"'It is unfortunate to see that people from my country are spreading racist ideology'    It is not difficult to find hurtful words from different people online who are unable to separate their fears about the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak from their xenophobic and hateful feelings towards Chinese. This doesn’t surprise me anymore because even before the news about the epidemic broke, there were already stories and news about the conduct and behavior of Chinese tourists in the country circulated all over social media platforms. Ugly slurs and comments about how the Chinese prepare their food or what kind of food they eat are pretty much everywhere. An example of this is the widespread news that bat soup is one of the most popular dishes in the country, particularly in Wuhan – the center of the 2019-nCov outbreak. (READ: WHO declares international emergency over novel coronavirus) For someone like me who has lived in Wuhan for more than 4 years, it is difficult to accept the misinformed stories that led to the hateful comments against majority of the Chinese population. I can't even imagine myself at the receiving end of this unmistakable discrimination and racism. Living in Wuhan gave me a different insight into what kind of people the Chinese are towards other citizens like me. I can better illustrate this through a story. One rainy night when I was walking to the nearest bus stop from a fun party, I noticed that my wallet, along with some cash, IDs, and bank cards, was gone. I couldn’t even open my phone because it had run out of battery, so e-payment was also not an option. My place was over 25 kilometers away and it was already past 2 am. There was no public bus or subway I could ride either. I was already too tired to go back to the party venue and ask anyone to give me a ride back home. I told myself to try my luck and see if there was anyone out there willing to give me a ride. I started walking until I spotted a green cab. I hailed the cab and talked to the driver about my situation. Without further questions, he let me in. “What a nice driver,” I silently told myself. It did not take long for him to notice that I was a foreigner. During our trip, we exchanged stories. He shared how challenging life is for him in a thriving city like Wuhan. Just like other stories of perseverance and self-sacrifice, his story is also remarkable. He is supporting his two children who are both studying while also taking care of his ailing wife. He also told me how he decided to escape his poor life in a rural town and started to dream for his family. For my part, I shared how it is to live in the Philippines and how similar his inspiring stories were with those of some Filipino drivers. The trip was about an hour long. When I got off in front of my apartment, I asked him to wait for me while I got my money so I could pay him. He quickly refused. He said that he believed I was a good person even if we'd just met for the first time. I insisted and said that he needed the money for his family. He calmly smiled and said “I drive a taxi not just for my family. I also love my job because I love meeting people like you who are willing to listen to my story.” He humbly continued, “I obviously can’t afford to travel abroad but through your story, it is as if I have experienced life in a different country. And that feels really good.” I was in complete awe after hearing those words from him. I did not realize the impact of genuinely listening and sharing stories until he uttered those inspiring words. The only request the driver had was to take a selfie with me. Most Chinese people I've met love taking selfies with their international friends. Although I was embarrassed about my post-party appearance, I was happy to accommodate his request. I shook his hands and said ""Zai jian,"" (roughly translated as “see you again” in Chinese) then went back to my room happy with an unforgettable memory. The next day, I woke up to a call from the police station. Before I could fully comprehend what the police was saying, he mentioned that my missing wallet was at their station. He told me that a bus driver had found it and surrendered it to their office. “What a kind bus driver,” I told myself after the call. It is just a pity that the city that brought me such wonderful memories is battling a serious epidemic. It is even more unfortunate to see that people from my country are spreading racist ideology with their ethnocentric-remarks, like how the Chinese are ""uncivilized"" and “dirty-eaters.” I believe that we can rally against the actions and inactions of involved governments without being xenophobic towards any citizens. We can deliberately criticize those in power, those who handle the crisis, and those policies that are supposed to protect the people concerned without feeding into the anger against Chinese or other citizens. If there is one thing I learned from my encounter with the cab driver in Wuhan, it is compassion. When things get hard for others, we don’t need to make the condition harder for them. Instead, we spread compassion to make the situation more bearable for everyone. – Rappler.com Dr. Marshal Murillo is an associate professor of political science and public administration at the Ateneo de Naga University.

Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal celebrate their 2000 NBA championship. Photo by AFP LOS ANGELES, USA – A shattered Shaquille O'Neal says his relationship with Kobe Bryant was like brotherhood, from their epic split after 3 NBA titles together to mutual respect and love after tensions healed. Kobe died Sunday aged 41 in a helicopter crash, a shocking loss that has left his former Los Angeles Lakers teammate Shaq sleepless, unable to eat and watching 20-year-old video highlights of their heyday. ""We still are the best duo ever created. That's never going to change,"" Shaq said on his social media outlet ""The Big Podcast."" ""I'm not doing well. I haven't eaten. I haven't slept. I'm looking at all the tapes. I'm sick right now. ""This is going to hurt a long time. I have a little brother, but I really lost a brother."" With Shaq the overpowering center and Kobe a deadly sharpshooting guard, the Lakers captured NBA titles in 2000, 2001 and 2002. ""Not only did we win 3, we dominated 3,” Shaql said. ""It wasn't even close."" But seeds of discontent grew with their success. Shaq arrived in the 2000-2001 training camp out of shape while Kobe had worked hard in the off-season and was unhappy Shaq hadn't shown similar resolve. In 2003, as Bryant contested rape charges that were later dropped, Shaq suggested Kobe needed to pass more often. Kobe reportedly said he should have paid off women to keep silent about encounters the way Shaw did. Each player so vital to the Lakers' domination sought credit as the most crucial of the duo and the magic was gone, LA losing to Detroit in the 2004 NBA Finals. ""In the fourth (final), things happened. People were hurt. People were out. We didn't pull it off,"" Shaq said. ""Changes had to be made."" Shaq demanded a trade and was sent to Miami. A day later, free agent Kobe re-signed with the Lakers. ""Everything that happened happened,"" Shaql said. ""A lot of people like to look at the negative side but I think (people) understand this as a Laker fan, the plan worked out perfectly. We won 3 in a row. ""It would have been a more horrific story if we didn't win any.""  What if?' haunts Shaq Shaq won the 2006 crown with Miami, teaming with star guard Dwyane Wade. Kobe would surpass him in career crowns by sparking the Lakers to titles in 2009 and 2010. ""Just one more than Shaq,"" Kobe said when asked what his fifth title meant to him. Shaq retired in 2011 and Kobe in 2016 and time helped heal the split, Shaq calling Bryant ""the greatest Laker ever"" with Kobe saying in 2013 they had developed ""mutual respect"" and a ""really good relationship."" ""Our relationship was that of brothers,"" Shaq said. ""All this stuff that is documented between us, it was never a dislike. This is what brothers do. ""I have a brother. We fight all the time but I love him. I love Kobe Bryant (the same way). ""I'm the first to say, 'Hey, I got 4 rings and I know I couldn't get 3 without him.'"" ""Shaq"" will never know how many he and Bryant could have won had they stayed together like such prior Laker duos as Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West or Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. ""Sometimes when competition comes – the competitive edge, you know – I'm glad we became closer,"" O'Neal said. ""But I just sit back and say what if?""  'Hurt for a long time' Even with the mended relationship, Shaq has some regrets. ""I wish we would have communicated more. But that's just how we are,"" O'Neal said. ""When we saw each other it was love and respect... Just wish I could have sat and talked to him before."" In the meantime, Shaq has memories of past glories such as when Kobe jumped into his arms in the seconds after they captured their first NBA titles back in 2000. ""I ain't going to get no sleep for a while. Just been sitting up watching old highlights,"" Shaq said. ""Even if I just wanted to cry and get away from it, I couldn't."" Shaq wants to be sure more unspoken words aren't left unsaid to others in the wake of Bryant's death. ""You don't really know how long you have left,"" he said. ""I'm all about being hard and all that but... I'm going to have to delete my beef and my confrontation clause. I don't want to do that any more. ""I guess I just call all the people I've had discrepancies with and say, 'Look man, I love you.' ""This one is going to hurt for a long, long time. I wish he was here.

Photo by Phyo Maung Maung/AFP GENEVA, Switzerland – The World Health Organization cautioned Friday, January 31, that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting the transmission of the deadly novel coronavirus from China and could even accelerate its spread. If you close official border crossings, you can ""lose track of people and cannot monitor (their movement) anymore,"" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told reporters in Geneva. The UN health agency on Thursday, January 30, declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions and urged the numerous countries already taking such measures to reconsider. But with the disease – which has killed 213 people and infected nearly 10,000 in China – spreading to more than 20 nations, governments, businesses and worried people around the world were taking matters into their own hands. Several countries have halted cross-border traffic from China or banned entry from travelers from Wuhan, the city in central Hubei province where the virus first surfaced last month. But Lindmeier warned that countries' efforts to halt the virus by closing their borders and banning arrivals from China could be counterproductive. ""It might be a logical step to...say, look we see a danger from outside, so let's lock ourselves up,"" he said. ""But as we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases whenever people want to travel...if the official paths are not open, they will find inofficial paths. ""But the only way to control, to check fever for example, to identified travel history, to try to monitor who's coming across the border, and to see whether they have any signs of infection is through official border crossing points,"" he said. ""This is a huge reason to keep official border crossing points open."" – Rappler.com "

File photo MANILA, Philippines – Pedro Taduran hopes to stop Mexican Daniel Valladares with body blows when they collide for the Filipino’s International Boxing Federation minimumweight crown on Saturday, February 1 (Sunday, February 2, Philippine time) at Gimnasio Cedereg in Guadalupe, Mexico. Art Monis, Taduran’s handler, disclosed the fight strategy before they flew out of the country last Saturday and said they’re sticking to the plan, especially if Valladares decides to engage toe-to-toe. With only light training ahead for Taduran, attention is focused on the pride of Libon, Albay making the 105-pound limit on Friday’s official weigh-in. Monis told PowcastSports Taduran weighed 106.4 on Wednesday, so it’s almost certain the 23-year-old southpaw would make the grade. Former IBF light flyweight champion Tacy Macalos is supervising Taduran’s training. Unable to accompany Team Taduran to Mexico, MP (Manny Pacquiao) Promotions president Sean Gibbons has designated Javier Jimenez, a former marine who has worked with boxers for 25 years, to attend to the Filipinos’ needs. “He (Jimenez) is taking care of everything,” said Gibbons, who intends to be in Mexico in time for the weigh-in. And thus far, Jimenez has met Team Taduran’s expectations, including hotel accommodations and training gym, according to Monis of Hardstone Monis Boxing Gym in Valenzuela City. According to Gibbons, he’s confident Taduran would emerge triumphant because he works hard like Pacquiao and is a “non-stop punching machine.” Unless, of course, the machine conks out. – Rappler.com  "

Dominic Thiem (left) bundles out Alexander Zverev in the semifinal, saying it's 'unreal' to reach the championship round. Photo by Saeed Khan/AFP MELBOURNE, Australia – Tireless Dominic Thiem came from a set down to outlast German Alexander Zverev and make his first Australian Open final Friday, January 31, booking a showdown with seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. The 26-year-old 5th seed, the first player from Austria ever to reach the Melbourne decider, battled past 7th-ranked Zverev 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4) on a sweltering evening. Defending champion Djokovic awaits him after the 2nd seed ended Roger Federer's dreams in straight sets Thursday to make his eighth Melbourne Park final. Thiem has his work cut out against the Serb who is on a 12-match unbeaten streak this season and has won all 7 of the Australian Open deciders he has contested. And if Djokovic needs extra motivation, winning on Sunday will see him reclaim the world No. 1 ranking after Rafael Nadal crashed to Thiem in the last 8. ""It was an unreal match, two tiebreakers, so tough and so close. It was almost impossible to break him,"" said Thiem. ""Being in the Australian Open final is unreal. What a start to the season for me."" Thiem had dealt with semifinal pressure before, although always on the slower red clay at Roland Garros, where he reached the past two finals only to be beaten by Nadal. That experience paid dividends as he coolly closed out the match after 3 hours and 42 minutes to give himself another chance to break the stranglehold of the Big Three and win his first Grand Slam. ""I was playing 4 hours, 10 against Rafa (in the quarterfinals), who is the most intense guy on tour, almost always so intense and long,"" Thiem said. ""So it was not easy to recover. But once all the adrenalin came, already when I walked into the full stadium was fine, actually, but still I had some troubles in the first set."" Light failure A jittery Thiem was broken in the opening game, saving two break points before sending a backhand wide to immediately be on the back foot. Both players were nervous and the German failed to consolidate, broken straight back. Their momentum was interrupted when rain began falling and the roof needed closing, but it was only a brief intermission and Zverev resumed to hold for 2-2. Thiem was still struggling with his first serve and a double fault handed the German a chance to go 4-3 in front and he grabbed it. Zverev took command, putting 90% of his booming first serves in, and broke again to seal the set as the Austrian error-count mounted. But the 22-year-old lost focus and two double faults in game 3 of the 2nd set handed Thiem a 2-1 lead. Zverev managed to break back but he was too erratic as Thiem broke again and clung on, firing an ace to take set 2. Bizarrely, play was halted for 9 minutes one game into the 3rd set when a light went out above the baseline and it bothered Zverev. When they resumed, Thiem held serve and then broke with an epic backhand winner as Zverev again lost concentration and the momentum appeared to shift. Thiem is one of the best returners in the game and was getting almost every ball back. He looked to be on his way, but Zverev refused to surrender and broke again to even it up. It went to a tiebreak where Thiem turned on the style to take a stranglehold on the match. There was little between them in the crucial fourth set as they traded blows. It went to serve and another tie-breaker when Thiem's experience helped him over the line. – Rappler.com  "

This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act,' says British Prime Minister Boris Johnson  BREXIT. Red, white and blue lights illuminate 10 Downing Street, the official residence of Britain's Prime Minister, in central London on January 31, 2020, after Britain left the European Union at 2300GMT. Photo by Tolga Akmen/AFP LONDON, United Kingdom (3rd UPDATE) – Britain on Friday, January 31, ended almost half a century of European Union membership, making a historic exit after years of bitter arguments to chart its own uncertain path in the world. There were celebrations and tears across the country as the EU's often reluctant member became the first to leave an organization set up to forge unity among nations after the horrors of World War II. Thousands of people waving Union Jack flags packed London's Parliament Square to mark the moment of Brexit at 11 pm (2300 GMT) -- midnight in Brussels. ""We did it!"" declared Nigel Farage, the former member of the European Parliament who has campaigned for Brexit for years, before the crowd began singing the national anthem. It was a largely good-natured gathering, aside from one Brexit supporter who earlier set an EU flag alight. But Brexit has exposed deep divisions in British society, and many fear the consequences of ending 47 years of ties with their nearest neighbours. Some pro-Europeans, including many of the 3.6 million EU citizens who made their lives in Britain, marked the occasion with solemn candlelit vigils. Brexit has also provoked soul-searching in the EU about its own future after losing 66 million people, a global diplomatic big-hitter and the clout of the City of London financial center. 'Not an end, a beginning' In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson – a figurehead in the seismic 2016 referendum vote for Brexit – acknowledged there might be ""bumps in the road ahead"". But he said Britain could make it a ""stunning success."" As he held a private party in his Downing Street office, a clock projected on the walls outside counted down the minutes until Brexit. Johnson has promised to unite the island nation in a new era of prosperity, predicting a ""new era of friendly cooperation"" with the EU while Britain takes a greater role on the world stage. ""The most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end but a beginning,"" he said in a televised address. EU institutions earlier began removing red, white and blue Union flags in Brussels ahead of a divorce that German Chancellor Angela Merkel called a ""sea-change"" for the bloc. French President Emmanuel Macron described it as a ""historic warning sign"" that should force the EU and its remaining nations of more than 440 million people to stop and reflect. Britain's departure was sealed in an emotional vote in the EU parliament this week that ended with MEPs singing ""Auld Lang Syne"", a traditional Scottish song of farewell. Almost nothing will change straight away, because of an 11-month transition period negotiated as part of the exit deal. Britons will be able to work in and trade freely with EU nations until December 31, and vice versa, although the UK will no longer be represented in the bloc's institutions. But legally, Britain is out. And while the divorce terms have been agreed, Britain must still strike a deal on future relations with the EU, its largest trading partner. Both will set out their negotiating positions Monday. ""We want to have the best possible relationship with the United Kingdom, but it will never be as good as membership,"" European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in Brussels. 'Goodbye & good luck' Getting this far has been a traumatic process. Britain resisted many EU projects over the years, refusing to join the single currency or the Schengen open travel area, and eurosceptics have long complained about Brussels bureaucracy. Worries about mass migration added further fuel to the Brexit campaign while for some, the 2016 vote was a chance to punish the government for years of cuts to public spending. But the result was still a huge shock. It unleashed political chaos, sparking years of toxic arguments that paralysed parliament and forced the resignations of prime ministers David Cameron and Theresa May. Johnson brought an end to the turmoil a decisive election victory in December which gave him the parliamentary majority he needed to ratify his Brexit deal. But Britons remain as divided as they were nearly four years ago, when 52 percent voted to leave and 48 percent voted to remain in the EU. ""Rise and shine... It's a glorious new Britain"" said the Brexit-supporting Daily Express. In Scotland, where a majority voted to stay in 2016, Brexit has revived calls for independence and there were protests Friday outside parliament. And in a sign of potential constitutional trouble ahead First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Scotland will return to the heart of Europe as an independent country – #LeaveALightOnForScotland."" In Northern Ireland, where there are fears Brexit could destabilise a hard-won peace after decades of conflict over British rule, a billboard read: ""This island rejects Brexit."" Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney tweeted: ""Goodbye & good luck."" 'Glad it's over' Johnson, who remains a polarizing figure accused of glossing over the complexity of leaving the EU, has avoided any big official celebrations that might exacerbate divisions. He hosted a special cabinet meeting in the northeastern city of Sunderland, which was the first to declare for Brexit in 2016, but did not appear in public. Downing Street and several government buildings were lit up in colours of the British flag on Friday night, while millions of commemorative 50 pence coins have also been issued. It was a different story in nearby Parliament Square, where the moment of Brexit was met with cheers, the lighting of flares and balloons let off into the night sky. ""What happens now marks the point of no return. Once we have left, we are never, ever going back,"" Farage told the crowd of cheering supporters. At a ""Big Brexit Bash"" in Morley, northern England, Raymond Stott described the four years since the referendum as ""a right cock-up"". ""I am just glad it's all over. We will look after ourselves. We don't need Europe,"" said the 66-year-old. But for many pro-Europeans, Friday marks a day they hoped would never come. ""Today is a day of mourning,"" said Katrina Graham, 31, an Irish women's rights activist who lives in Brussels, at a protest in central London. Trade talks loom From Saturday, Britain will be free to strike trade deals around the world, including with the United States. Johnson has given himself just 11 months to negotiate a new partnership with the EU, covering everything from trade to security cooperation -- despite warnings this is not enough time. He also discussed with his ministers on Friday an aim to get 80 percent of Britain's commerce covered by free trade agreements within three years, a spokesman said. US President Donald Trump is an enthusiastic supporter of Brexit, and one of his top envoys on Friday hailed an ""exciting new era"". ""We will continue building upon our strong, productive, and prosperous relationship with the UK as they enter this next chapter,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. – Rappler.com "

The two cases were registered in the Zabaikalsky and Tyumen regions of Siberia, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said in televised remarks. Golikova sought to downplay the risk of the infection spreading across the country, saying the two patients had been put in isolation. She said Russia would evacuate some citizens from China. ""We are beginning to evacuate Russian citizens from Wuhan and Hubei. Three hundred people from Wuhan and 341 in Hubei,"" she said, adding that those who return will be quarantined.

Four Chinese airlines will also continue to offer flights to Russia, she added. Rail freight and postal service between the two countries will not be affected. On Thursday, January 30, Russia said it was closing the border with China in the Far East to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus and would stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. Golikova said on Friday that Russia also planned to suspend issuing work visas to Chinese nationals. She also cautioned Russians against snapping up medical masks and medicine, saying there were no shortages. ""We don't have such a problem,"" said Golikova. ""There is no need to worry."" The country's consumer health watchdog recommended that Russians wear medical masks in crowded places, avoid zoos and refrain from greeting each other with handshakes or kissing each other on the cheek.

The Chinese fighter pinned Kingad to the fence in the 2nd round, where they exchanged heavy hits to the leg and body as “The King” wrapped up the round with a spinning back elbow that Xie blocked. Kingad hung on by a thread and leaned on his defense in the final round to stop the aggressive offense of his foe.

As Mighty held a 12-point lead, 78-66, at the 3:20 mark in regulation, AS Sale erupted for a crucial 10-2 run in the clutch, capped off by back-to-back and-one buckets by Abderrahim Najah to inch within 4, 76-80, with 1:36 left. However, the Moroccans failed to capitalize on their late momentum as import Wayne Arnold bricked a triple after a Thirdy Ravena miss and an Andray Blatche traveling violation. Najah then missed an easy two with 24 ticks left as Mighty dribbled out the clock for the win. Despite the late miscues, Blatche balled out as well for his fellow Filipinos as he flirted with a triple-double off a 17-point, 11-rebound, 8-assist line. Fil-Am guard Mikey Williams rounded out the team’s double-digit scorers with 12 markers on a 3-of-7 shooting from deep.

A crew member of an evacuation flight of French citizens from Wuhan gives passengers disinfectant during the flight to France on February 1, 2020, as they are repatriated from the coronavirus hot zone. Photo by Hector Retamal/AFP BEIJING, China (UPDATED) – The death toll from China's new coronavirus outbreak has risen to 259 and the tally of confirmed infections has surged to nearly 12,000, the government said on Saturday, February 1. The National Health Commission said in its daily update that 46 more people had succumbed to the respiratory disease. All but one of the new deaths came in hardest-hit Hubei province, the epicenter of an outbreak that has spread around the world. The virus emerged in December in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, and has been traced to a meat market that sold wild game. The number of infections in China also rose, by 2,102, bringing the nationwide total to 11,791. Fresh cases have been detected abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) The top Communist Party official in Wuhan, the central city of 11 million people where the virus first emerged in December, on Friday expressed ""remorse"" because local authorities acted too slowly. Last week, China's central government finally jumped into action, effectively sealing off Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, and curbing travel across the nation of 1.4 billion people. But the epidemic has spread far and wide as Chinese people travelled across the country and abroad over the Lunar New Year holiday that started last week. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions. Countries nonetheless intensified travel curbs. The United States told its citizens not to go to China and urged those already there to leave – drawing a sharp rebuke from Beijing, which said the move was ""certainly not a gesture of goodwill."" On Friday, Washington doubled down, declaring its own public health emergency and temporarily barring entry to any foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the past two weeks. Japan has joined the US, Britain, Germany and other nations that have recommended that their citizens avoid China. Singapore's government barred arrivals from China and transit passengers who visited the country in the past 14 days. Mongolia will ban Chinese nationals and foreigners coming from the neighbouring country until March 2. World markets tumbled Friday on the mounting concerns. Flights suspended The WHO's rare declaration of an emergency allows the UN health body to issue recommendations that the international community is expected to follow. But it warned Friday that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmissions of the virus -- and could even accelerate its spread. China's ambassador to Geneva said his country was controlling the outbreak and insisted there was no need for ""unnecessary panic"". Beyond government travel advisories, businesses and worried travellers have been taking matters into their own hands, with airlines suspending or reducing flights with China. The virus is believed to have originated in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals. It then jumped to humans. Wuhan officials have been criticized online for withholding information about the outbreak until the end of last year, despite knowing about the new illness weeks earlier. ""Right now I'm in a state of guilt, remorse and self-reproach,"" said Ma Guoqiang, the municipal Communist Party secretary for Wuhan. ""If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now,"" he told state broadcaster CCTV. People in China have so far directed their anger at local officials in Wuhan and Hubei, but the crisis could pose a challenge to President Xi Jinping, who has called the epidemic a ""demon"" that China can defeat. Countries have scrambled to evacuate their nationals from Wuhan, with hundreds of US, Japanese, British, French and South Korean citizens evacuated so far, and more countries planning airlifts. (READ: Coronavirus: Countries evacuate citizens from China) A flight carrying more than 300 Indian nationals left Wuhan in the early hours of Saturday for New Delhi. About 200 US evacuees who landed in California on Wednesday have been put under a rare mandatory quarantine order for 14 days. US carriers American, United and Delta joined other airlines suspending flights to China, following the State Department travel advisory. Russia said it would evacuate more than 2,500 of its citizens holidaying on China's Hainan island, far from the epicentre of the outbreak, a day after sealing its remote far-eastern border. Global anxiety The health crisis has also dented China's international image abroad and put Chinese nationals in difficult positions abroad, with some communities complaining of ""latent racism"" in Italy. China on Friday sent charter planes to Thailand and Malaysia to bring Hubei residents back to Wuhan, citing the ""practical difficulties"" that they have encountered overseas. More than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial complex in Indonesia's Sulawesi island have been quarantined, although Indonesia has not reported any cases. Britain and Russia each reported their first two cases Friday, and Sweden announced its first infection. The number of cases in China now far exceeds the 8,096 cases from SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), a similar pathogen that spread to more than two dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed nearly 800 people, mostly in China and Hong Kong.  – Rappler.com "

Photo by Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP BRUSSELS, Belgium – At midnight on Friday, January 31, – 1,317 days after British voters decided to leave the European Union – Brexit finally came about. So what changed? So far, not much. Daily business between the United Kingdom and the EU will continue as before during an 11-month transition until the end of the year. This will allow London and Brussels to negotiate new arrangements to guide future relations, but in the meantime there are some practical changes. No turning back The United Kingdom has left the EU and the union has lost one of its largest and richest states, the first ever to quit the project. (READ: Britain leaves the EU – then what?) The EU has therefore lost 66 million inhabitants -- leaving it with a population of around 446 million -- along with 5.5 percent of its land mass. If Britain ever does decide it wants back in, then this will be a matter for EU accession procedures as for any outside applicant. The institutions In Brussels, the lowering of the Union Jack outside the European Parliament symbolised a concrete change: Britain is out of the union and a ""third country"". It has no MEPs, the 73 Brits elected in May have left. 46 of the seats will be kept for future EU members and 27 distributed among under-represented countries. Britain no longer has to nominate a top official to the European Commission, although London failed to do so last year and its seat is already vacant. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will no longer be invited to summits of the European Council of leaders, and ministers no longer attend EU council meetings. As non-EU citizens, Brits are not eligible for senior bureaucratic posts in Brussels, but many have already secured dual nationality and residence rights. More junior officials whose careers began before Brexit will stay in post. Britain will, however, continue to pay into the EU budget as the second largest net contributor after Germany until the end of the transition. Citizens rights According to the United Nations, around 1.2 million British citizens live in other EU countries, mainly in Spain, Ireland, France, Germany and Italy. And according to the UK stats office, another 2.9 million citizens of other EU countries live in Britain, around 4.6 percent of the population. Under the withdrawal agreement signed by both sides, both sets of expatriates retain the rights they had before Brexit to work and reside in their host country. But Britons in Europe and EU citizens in the UK may have to register with the authorities and individual member states will set up procedures of their own. Free movement will apply until the end of the transition. Afterwards, the withdrawal treaty says EU nationals will be able to stay in the UK if they continue to work. The UK government has said it intends to end ""freedom of movement"" for future EU arrivals, and precise details of reciprocal rights will be negotiated after Brexit. The negotiations Britain has, of course, already spent years negotiating with European Commission official Michel Barnier's Brexit task force on the terms of its departure. But these negotiations changed after Friday, when the ""Article 50"" procedure in the European Treaty expires and the UK becomes a third country. The UK nevertheless remains subject to EU law and the European Court of Justice until the end of the transition, and in any judgements in cases pending from before the final departure. Barnier is in talks with EU member states to draw up a negotiating mandate for a trade agreement to govern cross-Channel commercial ties after the transition. This will then be hammered out with UK officials in the same way as Europe's free trade agreements with other third countries, such as Canada or Singapore. Barnier will unveil the goals of his draft negotiating parameters on Monday, but EU leaders have already warned that Britain will not enjoy the benefits of membership outside the bloc. – Rappler.com "

(Photo by Andrew Caballero Reynolds/AFP WASHINGTON, DC, USA – The US Senate on Friday, January 31, rejected Democratic calls for new witnesses at Donald Trump's impeachment trial, paving the way for the president to be acquitted next week of the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Following the 51-49 vote, Republican senators said a vote for acquittal is expected at 4.00 pm (2100 GMT) on Wednesday. That would mean the trial will not have concluded before Trump is scheduled to give his nationally televised annual ""State of the Union"" speech on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress. (READ: Democrats warn of 'lawless' president in Trump impeachment arguments) Trump is all-but-assured of being acquitted by the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats to 47 for the Democrats and a two-thirds majority -- or 67 senators -- is needed to remove the president. Two Republican senators – Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine – joined 47 Democrats in voting to introduce further witnesses and documents into the historic trial of the 45th US president. Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced the refusal to introduce new witnesses into just the third impeachment trial of a president in US history, calling it a ""grand tragedy."" ""If the president is acquitted with no witnesses or no documents the acquittal will have no value,"" Schumer said. 'Sham trial' ""America will remember this day, unfortunately, where the Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, where the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham trial,"" he said. Democrats had been eager to hear from John Bolton following reports that the former national security advisor claims in an upcoming book to have been personally told by Trump that military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating his Joe Biden, his potential Democratic rival in November's presidential election. The charge is at the heart of the December 18 impeachment of Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said House prosecutors had already presented enough evidence to make their case and there was no need for further witnesses. ""A majority of the US Senate has determined that the numerous witnesses and 28,000-plus pages of documents already in evidence are sufficient to judge the House Managers' accusations and end this impeachment trial,"" he said. ""There is no need for the Senate to re-open the investigation,"" he said. ""Never in Senate history has this body paused an impeachment trial to pursue additional witnesses."" McConnell said he would consult with fellow senators, White House lawyers and Democratic House prosecutors ""to determine next steps as we prepare to conclude the trial in the coming days."" 'Partisan nature' Democrats had been hoping to sway enough Republicans to support the call for further witnesses but efforts collapsed when Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she would vote ""no"" to new testimony. ""Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,"" said Murkowski, one of four Republicans whose votes were seen as decisive on the witness issue. ""I don't think the continuation of this process will change anything,"" she added. Minutes before Friday's Senate session, a bombshell news story injected fresh controversy into the trial. In the latest of a series of reports on Bolton's yet-to-be-published book, The New York Times said the White House aide claims that Trump directed him in May to help pressure Ukraine for damaging information on Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Also taking part in that conversation, the book reportedly claims, were Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, whom Democrats also sought to subpoena; Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani; and Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel leading Trump's impeachment defense. In a White House statement Trump denied one specific aspect of the Bolton story, that he ordered Bolton to set up a meeting between Giuliani and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Giuliani told the Times there was never any conversation between the 5 on Ukraine. ""It is absolutely, categorically untrue,"" he said, according to the newspaper. Adam Schiff, the leader of the House impeachment prosecutors, opened Democrats' last-ditch arguments on Friday by saying the Bolton news underscored the need for witnesses. ""This trial is supposed to be a quest for the truth,"" Schiff said. ""Let's not fear what we will learn."" – Rappler.com "

US President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Huntington Center in Toledo, Ohio, on January 9, 2020. File photo by Saul Loeb/ AFP WASHINGTON, DC, USA – US President Donald Trump's administration on Friday, January 31, lifted US restrictions on landmines, saying new technology made them safer, outraging campaigners for the abolition of the explosives that maim thousands of civilians each year. In the latest reversal of a policy of his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump gave the green light to a new generation of ""non-persistent"" landmines that can be switched off or destroyed remotely rather than staying active in the ground forever. ""The Department of Defense has determined that restrictions imposed on American forces by the Obama administration's policy could place them at a severe disadvantage during a conflict against our adversaries,"" a White House statement said. ""The president is unwilling to accept this risk to our troops... President Trump is rebuilding our military, and it is stronger than ever."" Obama in 2014 banned the use of anti-personnel landmines with the exception, under pressure from military planners, of the Korean peninsula where the explosives dot the last Cold War frontier with North Korea. Obama also ordered the destruction of anti-personnel stockpiles not designed to defend South Korea and said the United States would not cooperate with other nations in developing landmines. The White House said the US military will now be free to deploy landmines around the world ""in exceptional circumstances."" Self-destructing mines In rescinding the White House directive, the Trump administration said policy would now be set by the Pentagon, which said it was still prohibiting traditional landmines that cannot be turned off or destroyed remotely. The new mines are set to self-destruct within 30 days but can be destroyed in as little as two hours if necessary, Vic Mercado, the Pentagon official in charge of the policy, told reporters. In his estimation, there is only a six in a million chance that the self-destruction system will fail. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that the United States took into account the safety of civilians but considered landmines among the ""important tools"" for the military. ""At the end of day, we want to make sure that we have all the tools in our toolkit that are legally available and effective to ensure our success and to ensure the protection of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines,"" he told reporters. 'Death sentence for civilians' Handicap International, a French-based aid and pressure group for people disabled by conflict, said it was ""revolted"" by Trump's decision. ""Trump's announcement on anti-personnel mines is a death sentence for civilians,"" said Anne Hery, the group's advocacy director. ""There are acts of war that are simply outside all rules. Mines belong to that category."" Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat active on human rights issues, fired off a letter to the Pentagon voicing alarm at the change. Any self-destructing mines need to have humans in control, considering that modern battlefields and civilian populations move so quickly, he said. ""I am proud that the United States is no longer a source of injuries and deaths caused by this indiscriminate weapon. The world is better for it,"" he wrote. ""I urge you, in the strongest terms possible, not to undo decades of precedent on anti-personnel landmines."" The Arms Control Association, a Washington-based research and advocacy group, said that ""smart"" landmines have failed to work and been rejected by all NATO allies of the United States. ""The world has moved on from the use of landmines. The United States should, too,"" said Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the association. More than 160 countries, including most of the Western world, are party to the 1999 Ottawa Convention that aims to eliminate anti-personnel mines. Major outliers include the United States, Russia and China, as well as India and Pakistan. Neither Obama's nor Trump's orders affect anti-tank mines, which are not prohibited. The United States has not deployed anti-personnel mines in any significant way since the 1991 Gulf War. In 2018, only one country – Myanmar – as well as a small number of non-state armed groups used landmines, according to the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor, which researches an annual report for a pressure group. The study found that 6,897 people worldwide were killed or injured by mines or leftover explosives from war in 2018. Nearly three-quarters of victims whose identities were known were civilians, and more than half of the civilians were children, it said. Researchers say that children are especially vulnerable to explosives, which they can mistake for toys. – Rappler.com "

997,250729,"February 01, 2020",Arts and Culture,"WATCH: As 'The Kingmaker' premieres at CCP, 'arts legacy' of Imelda Marcos comes into question",Amanda T. Lago,"Directed by Lauren Greenfield, 'The Kingmaker' takes a critical look at the former first lady's penchant for extravagance and its continuing effects on Filipino society  ART COLLECTION. Imelda Marcos shows off her art collection in a scene from Lauren Greenfield's documentary 'The Kingmaker.' Screenshot from YouTube.com/SHOWTIME MANILA, Philippines – The Kingmaker does not paint a very pretty picture of Imelda Marcos – at least not one that she would approve of. The Imelda audiences come to know in the film is far removed from the image of mother and queen that she tried to build at the height of the Marcos dictatorship, and continues to project today. In The Kingmaker, we see the former first lady as an unreliable narrator, ridiculously narcissistic, and so out of touch with reality that she somehow believes that crispy P20 bills handed out to street kids is an act of ""mothering."" And yet curiously the film premiered in the Philippines at the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), one of the products of Imelda's ""edifice complex,"" home to an institution that held a lavish dinner to honor her as their founding chair just a few weeks before the premiere. In fact, as CCP artistic director Chris Millado pointed out, the film was screened in a theater just one level below the lobby where the dinner was held. This is the irony that the CCP must wrestle with. Like a stain one can't seem to scrub out, traces of Imelda still linger in the CCP – whether it's her actual presence, or her name printed on a plaque, or her patronage acknowledged by an artist performing on stage. At the same time, the CCP has over the years supported and honed the free expression of artists across all forms – even those that are anti-establishment and anti-Marcos. The Kingmaker is only the latest example. In a panel following a matinee screening of the film, art scholar and curator Marian Pastor-Roces said it was high time that Imelda is separated from the CCP. For her, it was not art that Imelda represented, but excess. ""You know art and culture in the professional sense of these words, not in the general sense of these words, Imelda never represented that. As you can see in the film she represented what was gauche, what was really awful, what was not beautiful. I mean kita 'nyo naman ang suot niya, maganda ba 'yun (you saw what she was wearing, was it beautiful)?"" she said. She also said that while Imelda was the one that got CCP built, many other artists had been pushing for a cultural center at the time. ""She has nothing to do with culture, as a matter of fact. I mean she built this thing, alright but did she build this thing? There were a lot of people who were wanting to have a cultural center nung panahon niya (at the time)."" ""People like Leandro Locsin, they preceded her in thinking about such a cultural center. There were a number of forces in the 1960s that were wanting to build a cultural center. 'Yun naman ang ambisyon nung panahon na 'yun eh no (that was the ambition at the time)."" She added that in today's art scene, patronage – which Imelda used to her advantage in the Martial Law era – is an outdated format. ""Patonage is not for the 21st century. Neither was it really for the 20th century. Patronage is a very old form of supporting art. Hindi na 'yan ang magsusuporta sa art sa mga darating na henerasyon, so 'yung formula na may patron, hindi na 'yan tama or sapat para sa art (it is not what is going to support artists in the coming generations. It is no longer a good fit for art),"" she said. ""So kalimutan na si Imelda Marcos sa building na ito (let's forget Imelda Marcos in this building),"" she said. The Kingmaker producer William Mellor told Rappler that it was ""deeply ironic"" that their film was screened at the CCP. ""As Chris [Millado], the director here was saying to me just before the show, he said not only is it an irony that it's being shown here, but it's doubly ironic because this is one of two places I believe in the Philippines where you can show films without them being censored,"" he said. In a speech before the evening screening of the film, Millado spoke of CCP's double-sided history, citing National Artist Resil Mojares when he said: ""CCP was founded in 1969, but it was born in 1986. For 17 years, Imelda Marcos was the main patron of the CCP. 33 years after, the CCP went through a process of reorientation that makes its programs more inclusive of previously marginalized sectors and artistic expressions."" ""I joined CCP in 1986. I value the indelible contributions of artists before that time. I embrace the thoughtful and critical leadership that followed after,"" he said. ""This is the mixed artistic legacy that I and many of my colleagues here at the CCP embrace."" – Rappler.com "
998,250730,"February 01, 2020",Tech Features,Xinjiang’s TikTok wipes away evidence of Uyghur persecution,"Isobel Cockerell, Coda Story","Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, appears to have been wiped of the most compromising information about Xinjiang  Image adapted from graphic by Sofiya Voznaya for Coda Story We don’t just follow stories, we follow up. Six months ago, our reporter Isobel Cockerell wrote a story about an international group of Uyghurs who trawled the Chinese version of TikTok for evidence of China’s mass crackdown on its Muslim minorities. Some spent every waking hour of their day on Douyin — the Chinese name for TikTok, which is digitally walled off from its international counterpart.  In the months that have passed, TikTok has come under fire for shutting down a video of a young woman who discussed the Xinjiang concentration camps while curling her eyelashes. The platform later apologized for a “human moderation error.” “TikTok does not moderate content due to political sensitivities,” a TikTok spokesman told me at the time. Since then, Xinjiang’s Douyin space has become an all-singing, all-dancing propaganda platform. When I first spoke to him, Sydney-based Uyghur activist Alip Erkin, 41, was trawling Douyin every day for evidence of China’s persecution in Xinjiang. In recent months, he believes the app has been wiped of the most compromising information about Xinjiang. “I feel that nowadays the videos that I would hope to see on Douyin have decreased in number,” said Erkin. “I think Douyin has gathered experience of how they can best censor people.” Now when Erkin logs on, he’s greeted by a wall of videos showing a sunny, smiling Xinjiang. “The visuals are very reflective of the facade of the situation and the fake acts of being happy and dancing and singing in public,” Erkin said. Erkin has noticed how the Uyghur language – which is Turkic in origin and uses Arabic script – is being wiped away from Douyin. “Most Uyghurs are using Mandarin now for their captions and in their videos,” he said. So #Uyghur script isn't allowed for Douyin (TikTok) acc names.Two requests to change acc name to one written in Uyghur script returned a notification saying ""it contains info that is against the rules."" But the one written in Latin was accepted immediately without approval. pic.twitter.com/XzYjGOCPFW  Erkin tried an experiment: “The other day I used a Uyghur language name to set up an account. About a minute later a notification came in saying: “the information you put in is not accepted by our rules.”” When Erkin changed it to Latin letters, the account name was approved. In November, a Douyin video of a young girl complaining about being censored for using Uyghur language went viral on social media. “I would like to ask Douyin, why are my videos suspended every time I do them in Uyghur?” Angelic #Uyghur girl asks TicTok [Douyin] why her videos in #Uyghur language are #suspended while allowing videos in English and Thai. pic.twitter.com/k0m84LcK7D  Aliye Yasin, whose name has been changed to protect her family, used to spend hours every day trying to trick the app’s algorithm into showing her content the Chinese government didn’t want her to see. For a while, it worked. But spending so much time on the app can take its toll. “I stopped digging,” she told me. Now, she says, whenever she logs on, “the algorithm just gives me propaganda again.” Last week, state-owned media outlet Global Times published an article about how a hashtag, #charmofthexinjiangpeople, had gone viral on Xinjiang Douyin. Hashtag challenge #charmofthexinjiangpeople has gone viral on Chinese short video app Douyin, which is operated by TikTok owner ByteDance, featuring beautiful Xinjiang people in gorgeous ethnic costumes, and, of course, their brightest smiles. https://t.co/OPoQNP8134 pic.twitter.com/gwVG13a09G  The article described how the hashtag featured “beautiful Xinjiang people in gorgeous ethnic costumes, and, of course, their brightest smiles.” The footage was in stark contrast to some of the video content that has previously leaked out of Xinjiang via Douyin, including images of religious buildings being destroyed, or long lines of people waiting to be scanned at one of many security checkpoints. “Bytedance collaborates with public security bureaus across China, including in Xinjiang where it plays an active role in disseminating the party-state’s propaganda,” observed a November report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. “It wasn’t that long ago that Uyghurs were using Douyin (TikTok) to shine a light on the brutal surveillance state in Xinjiang,” tweeted Fergus Ryan, an analyst at ASPI. “Looks like ByteDance has got that under control. Only “positive energy” now.” – Rappler.com Isobel Cockerell is a reporter and filmmaker with Coda Story.

In this file photo, Democratic presidential hopefuls Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, Mayor of South Bend Pete Buttigieg, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders participate a Democratic primary debate. Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP CLINTON, USA – Four US senators running for president paused their impeachment trial duties on Friday, January 31, to dash to Iowa, joining top rivals for a final weekend of campaigning before the state's all-important vote launches the Democratic Party's nomination contest. After a Senate vote on Friday paved the way for President Donald Trump's acquittal of charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, the impeachment trial was put on hold, allowing all candidates to enjoy a breathless final 72 hours of campaigning before the Iowa caucuses. Polls show a tight contest in the heartland state, where former vice president Joe Biden this week has been taking his ""Soul of the Nation"" bus tour to all corners in hopes it will help him cross the finish line in the top spot on Monday. Former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is running in the same moderate lane as Biden, is also on the ground, arguing it is time to turn the page to more forward-looking, galvanizing leadership. Biden, 77, ""is making the case that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,"" Buttigieg, who at 38 is less than half Biden's age, told a crowd at the Masonic Temple in the town of Clinton, Iowa. ""I would argue, this is not the time to take the risk of falling back on the familiar or relying on an old playbook that helped get us to this point,"" Buttigieg said. The contest to see who challenges Trump in November's election is a months-long slog, and those with minimal support have been peeling off. Former congressman John Delaney dropped out Friday. Eleven contenders remain in the race, and several have pitched up seeking to woo undecided Iowa voters, snatch a victory here, and claim the all-important momentum going forward to the next contests, starting with New Hampshire on February 11. Far-left Senator Bernie Sanders, who has a narrow lead in Iowa over Biden and Buttigieg, progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is in fourth place in polling, and fifth-place Senator Amy Klobuchar were jetting in from Washington to mount their 11th hour pushes for support. Trump's Senate impeachment trial has effectively tethered them to Washington, but the proceedings adjourned Friday after the chamber's Republican majority rejected Democratic efforts to subpoena witnesses and documents. Closing arguments will be made Monday, with a final acquittal vote Wednesday. 'Down to the wire' For two weeks, the senator candidates have been campaigning with one hand tied behind their back, sending surrogates including relatives and high-profile lawmakers to campaign in their stead. Among them is Sanders, 78 and the oldest candidate in the race, who enjoys strong support from young voters. His team organized a campaign concert featuring indie rock band Bon Iver on Friday near Des Moines. Sanders phoned in from Washington, rallying supporters to ""do everything you can"" to boost caucus turnout. The senator is set to host a similar show featuring Vampire Weekend on Saturday in Cedar Rapids. Warren is scheduled to attend a Friday night Get-out-the-Caucus rally in Des Moines, while Klobuchar is lined up for four events Saturday, at a brewery, a music venue, a women's club and a school. Nearly half of Democratic Iowa voters said they remained undecided before Monday's caucuses, the local meetings where participants align behind their candidates in one of the country's quirkier voting systems. Among them is Stephanie Hull, a 21-year-old student who came to see Biden in the small town of Burlington. ""It's a possibility"" that President Barack Obama's White House wingman earns her vote, she told AFP. ""I have a few other favorites right now, so it's going to be down to the wire."" Biden, whose global experience is unmatched among the candidates, has declared Trump a danger to America due to his erratic foreign policy. ""The next president of the United States is going to inherit a country that's divided and a world in disarray,"" Biden told attendees in his half-hour stump speech. ""There's going to be no time for on-the-job training."" Biden's blue-collar roots and his uncanny ability to connect personally with voters are huge assets in a state used to face-to-face encounters with candidates, although his Iowa speeches have lacked the passion that animates some rivals. Despite the agonizing over which political approach to take -- revolution or realism -- in the 2020 election, Iowa's Democratic Party chairman Troy Price said voters have unified around one goal. ""There's a lot of people that want to make sure that we defeat Donald Trump,"" Price said. Retired teacher Pat Carr, 69, thinks Buttigieg – a millennial gay military veteran – is best-suited to do that. In an era of hyper-partisanship, he said, ""I think Pete's a person who might be able to unite a little better than some of the others."" – Rappler.com "

1005,250737,"February 01, 2020",Thought Leaders,[OPINION | NEWSPOINT] Patronage presidency,Vergel O. Santos,"Nothing combines protection and benefaction in a more egregious, ludicrous, and ominous fashion than in the case of Bato de la Rosa, the retired police general, now a senator     When, upon his election, Rodrigo Duterte at once praised Hitler and Marcos and mocked God, the Pope, and the Catholic church, notice was served that the nation was in for an abnormal presidency, to say the least. The only reason Duterte has not made himself dictator yet, officially, well past the midpoint of his 6-year term, is that the armed forces, absent whose muscle a dictatorship is nothing, wouldn’t go along; they want to see a clear constitutional justification for it. It’s a hang-up they have developed after they allowed themselves to be dragged by Ferdinand Marcos through 14 years of Martial Law (1972 to 1986) and become inevitably complicit in his regime of murder and plunder. But Duterte has managed to establish something close to a dictatorship: a patronage presidency, dispensing protection and benefaction in exchange for fealty and tribute. In the still largely feudal Philippine culture, patronage may be normal practice, a way of life even, but, dispensed at the President’s bidding with the consent of Congress and the courts, the acquiescence of the military, and the keen participation of the police, patronage becomes an institutional conspiracy. And as in any conspiracy, it is the enforcers and other frontline functionaries that get prime protection – from accountability. That’s why Duterte’s assurances go out to the police repeatedly and in particular to the forces fighting his war on drugs, which is something of an obsession with him. With 30,000 kills in just over 3 years, they certainly can use presidential protection. As for benefaction, it is bestowed, in the most significant instances, at the expense of government contractors. Currently targeted are two water-service concessionaires, a broadcast licensee, and an American oil company that holds a land lease. Their contracts, in perfect valid standing for years and years, are suddenly declared disadvantageous to the government, which dealt them out in the first place. The cronies waiting to take over the deals are mere subjects of speculation, but only for now; they will be forced to come out when they claim the spoils. But nothing combines protection and benefaction in a more egregious, ludicrous, and ominous fashion than in the case of Bato de la Rosa, the retired police general, now a senator. His visa to the United States has been invalidated. No reason is given, but presumably he is covered by the newly imposed ban on anyone to do with the persecution of Senator Leila de Lima, a cause the US has taken up officially. As chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, De Lima had hounded Duterte, then mayor of Davao City, for death squad executions. Shortly after his election as president and hers as senator, she found herself in jail on implausible charges of drug trafficking, and for nearly 3 years now has remained detained and denied bail. As happened, it was under De la Rosa’s watch as police chief that the war on drugs was launched and went on to score 20,000 kills in just over a year, and that De Lima was picked up at the Senate and taken to jail. Serving both Mayor Duterte and Mayor Sara, his daughter, as police chief of Davao City and carrying on as national police chief in the Duterte presidency, De la Rosa cannot but only be a special Duterte favorite. And so, in something analogous to chasing a cockroach with a sledgehammer to protect a skittish ward, Duterte is taking on the entire American establishment; unless his beloved Bato gets a new visa he is chucking a defense pact that has stood for more than 20 years. The deal, of course, is not only absurdly disproportionate but downright delusional. But then, that is Rodrigo Duterte for you – a pathological case whose delusions make him insensible to any sense of proportion. What makes him an even more dangerous president than he is on his own is the sycophants, flatterers, and sundry indulgers who have his susceptible ear: Either they play him for their own profit or they are themselves not any healthier than he psychologically. – Rappler.com "

One of the individuals tried to leave the base and was placed under quarantine by the state of California, said CDC official Marty Citron, before the federal action. Questions over test accuracy The repatriated group submitted samples for testing at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta -- but officials now say they are not certain about the accuracy of their diagnostic tools. ""We are seeing in the cases that are in the hospital, we've seen people who had detectable virus, and they didn't have the technical virus, and then three days later they had detectable virus,"" said Robert Redfield, the CDC's director. Given that the extent of asymptomatic transmission was not yet clear, a negative test was not being used as a release criteria.

It indicates continuing movement of magma.  MONITORING TAAL. Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum Jr speaks during a press briefing on January 27, 2020. File photo by Darren Langit/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Another harmonic tremor, or rhythmic shaking associated with magma movement, was recorded from Taal Volcano in Batangas in the past 24 hours, said state volcanologists on Saturday morning, February 1. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said the harmonic tremor lasted 3 minutes. Phivolcs also recorded a 97-second harmonic tremor last Thursday, January 30. Director Renato Solidum Jr said then that it indicated magma continues to rise toward the surface of the volcano, which remains under Alert Level 3. In the past 24 hours, the Taal Volcano Network recorded a total of 182 volcanic earthquakes, including the 3-minute harmonic tremor and one low-frequency event. Low-frequency quakes are ""caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface,"" according to the United States Geological Survey. The latest figure of 182 is higher than the 116 recorded in the previous 24-hour period, which was stated in Phivolcs' bulletin on Friday, January 31. Phivolcs stressed on Saturday that the volcanic earthquakes show ""magmatic activity"" persists beneath Taal's crater. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission, meanwhile, was measured at an average of 65 tons per day, coming from a level that was too low to be detected. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. At the main crater, there was ""wispy to weak emission of white to dirty white steam-laden plumes 50 meters tall"" in the past 24 hours. The plumes described in the previous bulletin were higher – 500 to 700 meters tall. Given the conditions, Phivolcs said it is maintaining Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest) for Taal. The volcano has been on Alert Level 3 since the morning of January 26. Before that, it was on Alert Level 4 for two weeks, beginning the evening of January 12. The highest possible status is Alert Level 5, which would be raised when a hazardous eruption is in progress. For now, these could still happen: Taal Volcano Island; the barangays of Bilibinwang, Subic Ilaya, and Banyaga in Agoncillo; and the barangays of Gulod, Buso-Buso, and Bugaan East in Laurel remain on lockdown. These areas are within a 7-kilometer radius from the main crater, which is Phivolcs' recommended danger zone while Taal is under Alert Level 3. The ongoing Taal eruption has affected at least 126,952 families or 473,332 persons in Batangas, Quezon, Laguna, and Cavite, said the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on Saturday. Of those affected, 10,848 families or 37,163 persons remain in evacuation centers. (READ: In Talisay, desperate residents beg on the street for money, water) Even Phivolcs' team at the Taal Volcano Observatory in Talisay had to flee when the eruption began.

This memorandum was released a day after the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the first case of nCoV in the country – a 38-year-old woman who came from virus epicenter Wuhan and traveled to Cebu and Dumaguete before she was admitted to a government hospital in Manila. Issued from the Office of the President of Adamson University and posted online by the AdU Student Government, the memorandum stated that this decision was made “to ensure a healthy and virus-free environment.” “Thus, we have made a decision that all Chinese students, both graduate and undergraduate, observe self-quarantine starting today until February 14, 2020,” the statement reads.  It added that Chinese nationals are advised to postpone all transactions inside the university for the stated period of 2 weeks. It also urged professors and students to maximize use of the e-learning system so as not to hamper the continuous delivery of learning for the affected students. Meanwhile, local students and all other students will continue with their classes. Racism? But Filipinos on social media aren’t pleased with the safety precaution ordered by Adamson University to its Chinese students. Some of them pointed out how this decision from the University stirred racist attacks on Chinese nationals.   Nearly 10,000 people have been infected in China and new cases were found abroad, with more than 20 countries now affected by the disease. (READ: FAQs: Ano-ano ang alam natin tungkol sa 2019 novel coronavirus?) Why not include travel history? Some netizens also questioned the memorandum for singling out Chinese students and not the others with a travel history to the affected countries.    Better communicated Others defended the university saying that the memorandum was intended for good. Some said that the use of words in the memo should be phrased better.     Soon after the memorandum posted online went on fire, the university apologized to the public. It also made clarifications to its earlier memorandum. “The Memorandum modifies the previous one released, and we apologize for the misimpression it may have created,” the statement reads.  It clarified that those ""who travelled to and from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, including China and/or Hongkong, within the last month, or who may have in close contact or had exposure to a potential source of infection during their travel abroad” were ordered to observe self-quarantine and seek medical attention for at least 2 weeks. It further noted that Chinese students and guests who were not limited by the conditions earlier stated, were not included in those directed to undergo the self-quarantine advisory and would be allowed to enter the campus, as opposed to their earlier statement. The university also assured its community that it was working its best to ensure the health and safety of everyone. The 2019-nCoV that originated from Wuhan, China, has so far killed 213 and sickened nearly 10,000 people across the country and worldwide. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the virus. As of Friday, January 31, the DOH is monitoring 31 patients for the novel coronavirus. – Rappler.com "

Photo by Boy Ryan Zabal/Rappler AKLAN, Philippines (UPDATED) – Authorities are monitoring two persons in Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital in Kalibo, Aklan to minimize any chance of exposure to 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCov ARD). The first is a 23-year-old flight attendant who came from Wuhan, China on January 21 where she developed cough after 3 days. The cabin crew of that same flight was quarantined in a private isolation room since Thursday, January 30. Wuhan is considered the epicenter of the 2019-nCov ARD outbreak. The second, a 17-year-old male Chinese tourist, was also referred by a local hospital in Boracay Island to the Aklan provincial hospital after experiencing flu-like symptoms. Meanwhile, a flight attendant from Palawan with travel history in Taiwan and Shanghai, China, however, denied she was quarantined in Aklan provincial hospital. She said she was in the hospital to get her medical clearance on January 31, Friday. On January 28, 3 foreigners were discharged from the Aklan provincial hospital after the results of their tests for the 2019-nCov came out negative. Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr. said seaports and airports in Aklan were on heightened alert to step up precautions for the deadly and highly-contagious Wuhan coronavirus. PHO-Aklan was also closely coordinating with Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) to check incoming travelers from other countries. Kalibo airport manager Eusebio Monserate, Jr said passengers flying to and from Shanghai, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Peking, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Changsha and Wuhan in China on February 1 were affected by the indefinite cancellation of flights. ""Magiging drastic ang pagbaba ng numero ng flights at arrivals ng visitors natin in Kalibo airport. Lahat ng flights to China are suspended until further notice,"" he added. (The number of flights and arrivals of visitors in Kalibo airport will go down drastically. All of the flights to China are suspended until further notice.) Monserate said the cancellation of around 20 commercial flights was a precautionary measure to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 213 people in mainland China. Amid the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, the Aklan Medical Society urged the public on January 31 to observe good personal hygiene and stay healthy at all times to contain the 2019-nCOv ARD. The common symptoms of coronavirus include breathing difficulties, cough and cold, fever and shortness of breath. Meantime, the 11 Chinese tourists under medical observation in Kalibo, Aklan returned to China on January 31. They boarded a China Eastern Airlines plane around 2:40 pm, Friday, in Kalibo International Airport to take a four-hour flight en route to Chengdu, China. Cuachon said the tourists were fit to travel to China after they secured medical clearances from attending doctors. ""They had no flu-like symptoms and they will be closely monitored also in China,"" he added. The foreigners, who were spending their vacation in Boracay Island, were tracked down by health authorities. Four of them had close contacts with a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong. On January 24, the Chinese tourists – 7 adults and 4 children – were admitted in Aklan provincial hospital in Kalibo, Aklan. The Chinese nationals were asked to stay in the Gov. Corazon L.

The actress' agency Viva says she is under their management until 2029. File photo Jay Ganzon/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Nadine Lustre may have announced that she has terminated her contract with Viva Artists Agency, but her longtime management said that she will remain their exclusive artist for the next 9 years. In a January 31 statement, Viva said that Nadine first signed an agreement with Viva in 2009, with the assistance of her parents. Afterwards, she “executed subsequent contracts with Viva to extend their Exclusive Agency and Management Agreement until June 2029.” On January 27, Nadine through a statement from her lawyers said that she is now “self-managed” and has decided to terminate her contract with Viva. Viva responded hours after Nadine’s statement, saying she is still their contract artist and threatening legal action against her or anyone who deals directly with her. Nadine’s legal counsel Lorna Kapunan welcomed the threats of legal action “so [Viva’s] unconscionable, oppressive and illegal contract with Nadine (and their other artists) can be litigated in the proper forum.” ""It's about time that a David strikes out a Goliath that has taken advantage of young artists in the industry for the longest time,"" she said, according to an ABS-CBN report. In their most recent statement, Viva responded to Lorna, saying: “This is not a David versus Goliath scenario as portrayed by Atty Kapunan. Neither is this a situation where artists are taken advantage of by a talent management company.” ""Rather, this matter is about respect – respect for the law, respect for contractual commitments, and good faith in professional relationships,"" it added. Viva said that their contract with Nadine was mutually beneficial. The contract “required Viva to invest their time, resources, and good will to hone Nadine’s talent and build her reputation.” The agency said it had invested in workshops and talent training for Nadine, produced movies, prepared her for roles, and paired her with James Reid in a love team. “As a result of Viva’s efforts, Nadine is one of the most sought-after actresses in her generation,” Viva said. “On the other hand, Nadine as Viva’s exclusive talent is obligated to abide by the terms of her agreement. This requires Nadine to appear in tapings, shows, and events; to perform roles in movies which she agreed to do; to coordinate with VIVA on projects and endorsements that would advance her career; among others,” it added. The agency reiterated, “Nadine cannot simply turn her back on her contractual commitments after she received benefits as a Viva talent."" It also said that contrary to claims of Nadine's camp, Viva does not take advantage of young artists. “This accusation is malicious and unjustified,” Vica said. Nadine rose to fame in 2014, after starring in films like Diary ng Panget and Talk Back You’re Dead with James. The pair then starred in the hit series On The Wings of Love, catapulting them to superstar status, and turning them into one of the country’s most beloved love teams.

The first batch of the financial literacy orientation held at Ayala Malls-Legazpi. Photo courtesy of DOLE Bicol. FINANCIAL LITERACY. The first batch of the financial literacy orientation held at Ayala Malls-Legazpi. Photo courtesy of DOLE Bicol. ALBAY, Philippines – Job seekers in this province took the chance to learn more about personal money management, workers' rights, and business starter ideas as part of the Department of Labor and Employment's (DOLE) Anniversary Job Fair. Provided as side events at the job fair held on January 28, at least 60 people from more than 1,000 job applicants – including those hired-on-the-spot (HOTS) – spent time listening and asking questions regarding those respective topics. The mini-seminar was held in morning and afternoon batches. Andrea Joy Agutaya, the professional money management advisor invited by DOLE Bicol, said that you don't need to have an outright financially rewarding job to manage your money. She said the best way to start is to know where you are at this point. ""This way, you can set realistic goals and know the efforts needed to get there,"" she added. As an example, she said, ""Today you dressed up, woke up early, and prepared your credentials to find a job."" Agutaya asked, ""How can you get there (to financial security)? She said you must have a source of income which you'll have to budget. She said it was important to know and monitor your cash flow and two questions are important in gauging this: ""How much do you earn?"" and ""What are the things you prioritize?"" She suggested a 60-20-20 rule where 60% of your income goes towards regular expenses like your basic needs. Meanwhile, 20% would go to savings, while the other 20% would be your investment. With this rule in mind, ""you get to discipline yourself to set aside those portions of your income and not rely on what's left for your savings,"" she said. A part of the savings must be allocated for the emergency fund, which is ideally equivalent to your three to six month expenses, she said. For investment, she said it must correspond with your status as a first-time employee. According to her, this may include higher education and equipment to enhance a skill that you can monetize. While you can't do it all at once, Agutaya explained you can adjust the 60-20-20 rule based on your situation. Starting sooner helps in this regard. Workers' rights DOLE Bicol believes that as first time employees, briefing them about their rights is both necessary and essential in helping workers meet their financial goals. DOLE Bicol explained the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Law (RA 11058  Department Order 198-18) under the Labor Code of the Philippines which covers only the private sector. According to the law, employers can provide a safe and healthy workplace through capacity building of all workers. This would include the training; provision of information on OSH; use of equipment or devices with approved industry standards; and compliance with the requirements of OSH standards. For workers, they must be made aware of a number of things: DOLE Bicol also shared actual situations which showed how a lack of knowledge of the law – from either the employer or employee side or from both parties – could hinder an employer in fulfilling its duty and respective employees from receiving due compensation. Participants were also asked what the minimum daily wage is in Bicol – answering correctly that it is at P310 – as well as what what should only be in their payslip's deductions. They were also about the computation of 13th month pay. Any discrepancies, DOLE said, should be communicated first to the company management. DOLE can help as a mediator in case an employee's concern is not resolved through the Single Entry Approach (SEnA) program. The SEnA program gives workers access to a speedy, impartial, and inexpensive settlement procedure for all issues or arising from employer-employee relations A brief backgrounder on setting up business start-ups was also discussed by the Department of Trade and Industry - Bicol. Grant Robregado of Polangui, Albay who participated in the afternoon orientation and was hired on the spot at the fair, was thankful to DOLE Bicol for holding the job fair and its related side events. Meanwhile, Angela Regalado, a jobseeker who also participated in the orientations, said she gained knowledge she would be able to apply after college. ""It empowered me as a would-be employee and income earner. I hope in every job fair there would be side events meant for [adulting] orientations like these,"" she added. – Rappler.com "

Health authorities in white, full-body protective gear stood by the cabin door as the plane's 73 passengers disembarked, smiling through face masks and waving to news photographers. A second Xiamen flight landed soon afterwards carrying Hubei residents from Kota Kinabalu, a popular coastal tourist destination in Malaysia.

The move came after a more than 30 airlines worldwide announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country struggles to contain the spread of the epidemic. China's aviation agency had said there were 117 nationals from Hubei province in Bangkok and 100 in Kota Kinabalu who are ""willing to take the chartered flights back to Wuhan as soon as possible."" This was despite the fact that Wuhan and surrounding cities have been locked down by authorities for more than a week, effectively trapping more than 50 million people in their homes after a near-blanket transport ban. Nearly all of the 259 people killed in the outbreak so far were in Hubei. Hospitals have been overwhelmed in Wuhan. Agence France Presse reporters saw long queues, with some patients saying they lined up for two days to see a doctor. The charter flights prompted a flurry of discussion on Chinese social media. ""These people probably don't want to go back,"" said one, while another questioned if residents should be returned to Hubei if they were not infected. China has advised its citizens to postpone trips abroad and cancelled overseas group tours. Several countries including the United States, Germany, Britain and Japan have urged their citizens to avoid travel there. The US has also declared a national emergency, temporarily barring entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks.

As residents have now returned home after the Lunar New Year holiday, Hongkongers are taking extreme precautions to keep as virus-free as possible. With a reported 12,000 cases worldwide and over 250 deaths, Hong Kong is bracing itself for a surge in new infections. At the time of writing, 13 cases have been confirmed here, but still zero deaths.  PRECAUTION. With the SARS scourge still fresh in their mind, Hongkongers take all precautions. Photo by Tommy Walker Health officials are advising everyone to wear masks, wash hands regularly and stay indoors. Public sector workers have not been in the office, while museums, tourist attractions, and sports facilities have all been shut. Schools and kindergartens are closed until at least March 2. Several universities have followed suit. The city government has announced anyone who travelled from the stricken Hubei province, would be placed under quarantine. So far, Hong Kong is still lagging behind China, Singapore, Thailand, and Japan in the number of infections. Worried locals With the scars of the SARs epidemic still in their minds, Hongkongers are taking no chances with the coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. It’s already been confirmed the virus has speedily surpassed the 2003 epidemic, adding more panic. The World Health Organization has declared a Global Health Emergency. With the declaration,  locals have started rushing around shopping and stockingpiling on supplies. More worryingly, facemasks are increasingly difficult to get hold of, with many stores completely sold out.  SHORTAGE. Almost all grocery stores in Hong Kong have sold out supplies of surgical masks, alcohol wipes and alcohol gel. Photo by Tommy Walker Border controversy Locals have criticized border safety measures,  increasing more pressure on the government. But despite the government order Thursday, January 30, to reduce cross-border travel with the mainland, only a handful of minor crossings were closed. As it stands, Chief Executive Carrie Lam refused to back down and close all border crossing completely. Thousands of Hong Kong doctors, nurses, and health care workers are calling for total border closure, threatening government officials with strikes and resignations.As it stands, 5 countries have closed their borders to travellers from mainland China, including the U.S and Singapore. Reversed decisions As protests are easy to come by in today’s Hong Kong, controversial decisions these days are often challenged. Locals were furious with an initial decision to treat virus-inflicted patients free-of-charge in Hong Kong. This was later reversed. An estate in the town of Fanling, New Territories was abruptly chosen as a quarantine center, trigerring the anger of nearby residents. This prompted activists to set fires in sections of the estate, forcing the government to abandon the plan. Bleak beginning With the new decade only a month old, Hong Kong is in free fall. In addition to the outbreak of the coronavirus, there is a recession to deal with.  The city also continues to  reel with the months of social unrest. With the start of  ‘The Year of the Rat’, Hongkongers will have to apply some of its characteristics – being adaptable, observant and stubborn – to overcome yet another looming crisis. – Rappler.com "

Sofia Kenin says her 'dream officially came true.' Photo by David Gray/AFP  MELBOURNE, Australia – America's Sofia Kenin stunned two-time Major champion Garbine Muguruza to win the Australian Open in her first Grand Slam final on Saturday, February 1 becoming the youngest player to lift the trophy in 12 years. Kenin, 21, showed all her trademark aggression as she fought back from a set down to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 in 2 hours and 3 minutes. The 14th seed, who will now jump as high as 7th in the world and usurp Serena Williams as America's No. 1, was in tears at the end and headed straight for her father Alexander, who is also her coach. It was the final surprise in a tournament of upsets, where Williams went out in the third round and Kenin upset Australia's world No. 1 Ashleigh Barty in the semifinals. ""My dream officially came true, I can't describe this feeling,"" said Kenin. ""It's amazing, dreams come true. If you have dreams, go for it, it's going to come true."" Spain's Muguruza, 26, unseeded for the first time at a Slam since 2014, broke in the third game of the first set at Rod Laver Arena, where the roof was closed for rain. Moscow-born Kenin, who also ended the fairytale run of 15-year-old Coco Gauff on her way to the final, bounced her American stars-and-stripes racquet on the hardcourt in irritation. The powerful-striking Muguruza, who won just one match in the last six months of 2019 but found form at last in Melbourne, held her own serve for a 3-1 first-set lead and was in control. The highlight of a compelling set came when they were locked at 30-30 on Muguruza's serve. A 23-shot rally culminated in the Venezuelan-born Spaniard clinching a hard-fought point with a forehand volley at the net. Muguruza, who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in the off-season to help clear her head of tennis, stubbornly held for 4-2. Kenin demonstrated the fight that has become her calling card by saving 4 game points, then pulled level 4-4 when Muguruza produced two double-faults in a row. The Kenin comeback was shortlived, Muguruza breaking back immediately and taking the set in 52 minutes when the young American planted her forehand out. But the aggressive Kenin upped the ante in the 2nd set, breaking her more experienced opponent in the fourth game and easily holding to sprint into a 4-1 lead. Kenin, who won their only previous encounter in 3 sets, grabbed the 2nd set in an emphatic 32 minutes. A rattled Muguruza was seen briefly by a physio for what appeared to be a lower-back problem. Into the deciding set and the gutsy Kenin saved 3 game points in a pivotal fifth game, tossing the ball back over her head by way of celebration. She was gifted the break for a crucial 4-2 lead when the fading Muguruza again double-faulted, to sighs from Rod Laver Arena. And Kenin was gifted the title when Muguruza double-faulted once again – her eighth – on the American's second championship point. At 21 years and 80 days, Kenin is 22 days younger than Japan's Naomi Osaka when she won the title last year. She is the youngest champion since Maria Sharapova won aged 20 in 2008. – Rappler.com  "

1033,250768,"February 02, 2020",Science Solitaire,How operas can be make-overs for your soul,Maria Isabel Garcia,"'Learning music is like having your own personal Big Bang – you do not explode and expand into a space but rather, you make the space as you grow'   Best friends are such because they are great conspirators. One of my best friends was from high school. For years, she shared her cooking dish with me at the end of her cooking class so I could bring it home to my mother, who thought I was in the same cooking class, desperately hoping I would be good in it. I skipped many cooking and other “standard” elective classes in high school to study classical music (singing) in the Conservatory, which included arias and zarzuela. I also learned to sing a lot of early American Broadway songs then. I think when you do that when you are 12, aside from the pure joy you derive from music, you are able to create territories within yourself – territories that would probably be alien to me now. But learning music is like having your own personal Big Bang – you do not explode and expand into a space but rather, you make the space as you grow. I think a good measure of my “interior space” decades after, I owe to classical music. I am again acutely made aware of this musical debt because I had just seen Gaetano Donizetti’s Lucia Di Lamermoor and as with many if not all who have seen it, you become so aware of the power of music over you. But it is a common love story – echoed even today by many teleseryes - that spoke of true love corrupted by family because of the need to save a fortune. A woman, Lucia, who was in love with Edgardo (a member of a family enemy), fooled by her brother that Edgardo fell for another, was forced to marry another. She ends up killing her husband and goes mad because of that and because Edgardo loathed her for having married another. Lucia’s tortured soul dies and Edgardo upon learning of this, realizes the truth, and kills himself to be united with Lucia. But the music has transformed this common story into a universe all its own. Most young people seem to view classical music as antiquated and irrelevant in their lives. And Lucia Di Lamermoor, when I saw it, was an example. With the exception of one little boy, about 7, with the rest of his family, average age of the opera audience was maybe 55. One of the obvious reasons why most young people cannot connect to classical music is because they may think what is past only belongs to people who live in the past. In the sciences, when we compute for satellite launches or structural engineering in theme park rides, we go back to Newton’s equations. I do not see why it should be different in the performing arts where operas can explore the web of human emotions as they have been enacted in souls past, in the emotions of our fellow humans, in the most creative way and in the safest of harbors – the theater. In Act I when Lucia and Edgardo vow their love for each other and express their pain of having to temporarily part, you get to feel the joy and pain of being so attached to someone and face the prospect of being apart not in real time but in the inner time of your inner life’s space. Whereas now, all you could muster is an emoticon with hearts or “PM me” or “Text me” to someone you love who is about to leave for an indefinite amount of time, in an opera, you get to explore and feel that specific complex emotion in 7 music pages – the equivalent of 7 emotional seas. It is where you and that emotion are face-to-face creating that very space just for that encounter. You do not come out of that the same, even if you try to resist it or deny it. A 2017 study on opera and young people found that if young people are given a chance to participate in an opera, not even for professional development, they gain a sense of confidence and a connection with a culture and being part of it, contributing to it. That speaks of the sense of the larger-than-self that emotions should grow into so that young people can gracefully learn to resist their “I am the center of the universe” instinct. But sadly, the kind of education we give our children largely reinforce the fragmented way we look at the world. This includes the unyielding divide in teaching the arts and the sciences as if real life were really divided as such. We also associate the sciences with “jobs” and “arts” with “no jobs.” And then we are shocked and feel despair over our own inadequacy to navigate our own emotions when we are older and the resulting lives we have because of that.  We did not allow the arts to get inside our lives that way when it could have enabled us to safely “practice” a range of human emotions inside us as we identify with roles and situations played out in theater. “Opera” is from the Italian word that literally means “work” or “labor.” And it is. It is undoubtedly that for the composer/writer, for the director, actors/singers, and the other members of the opera. But it is most certainly also “work” for the audience – inner work, inner crafting – for a few hours, to shatter the bounds of time, the borders of your own personal experiences.  It is labor that is worth it for your own soul’s make-over. – Rappler.com Maria Isabel Garcia is a science writer.

Against those overwhelming odds, few are giving Dominic Thiem much of a chance to wrench the title from his iron grip and clinch a maiden Grand Slam. But the Austrian, remarkably, is the one with the recent edge. Djokovic is 6-4 in their career head-to-heads, but Thiem has won 4 of the last 5. Three of those were on his favored clay, but he also came from a set down to beat the Serb on hardcourts at the ATP Finals in November. Djokovic is the first to admit that the slick 26-year-old has successfully refined his game over the past 12 months to compete on all surfaces. And he acknowledges it is just a matter of time before Thiem wins a Slam. ""I don't think he's really anymore 'next generation'. He's been around for many years. Now already he's an established top 5, top 10 player,"" said Djokovic. ""It's just a matter of one match here and there that can potentially give him a Grand Slam title, that he can actually get in the mix of top 3 in the world,"" he added. Despite the platitudes, Djokovic, 32, is banking on adding yet another chapter to his storied Melbourne Park career, and heads into the match with an extra day's rest after dispatching an injured Roger Federer in his semifinal on Thursday. The world No. 2 has been firing ever since arriving in Australia a month ago, and was unbeaten over 6 ATP Cup singles matches as he led Serbia to the inaugural title ahead of the Australian Open. ""Yes, I'm pleased with the way I've been feeling and playing. I thought ATP Cup went really well for me, got a lot of hours spent on the court, singles and doubles,"" said the 16-time Grand Slam winner. ""Obviously got a lot of positive energy from that competition. I dropped only one set so far up to the finals. Hopefully I'll be able to perform as well as I always have in the Australian Open finals."" 'It's his comfort zone' Thiem, who has beaten 4 seeds to make the grade, including Rafael Nadal in the last 8, is no stranger to Grand Slam finals, making the last two at Roland Garros. But this is his best effort outside of the French Open. He lauded Djokovic as the ""king of Australia"" and insisted his recent succusses against him counted for little at the Serb's favorite tournament. ""It's true, I won I think more of the last encounters than he did. But I think it doesn't count so much. It's absolutely his comfort zone here,"" he said. ""He always plays his best tennis in Australia since many, many years. So I'm expecting that as well in the finals. ""All I can do is my best again, play great tennis again, and of course take a look at the last matches we had... try to repeat the good stuff that I did there."" Despite playing down his chances, Thiem has the weapons to trouble Djokovic. He is supremely fit and regarded as one of the fastest movers on court, with a one-handed backhand that generates heavy spin and a power-packed forehand. While the slower clay has always been his preferred surface, beating Federer in the Indian Wells final last year was a turning point for the Austrian on hardcourts. ""That victory gave me so much relief and so much confidence because finally I got my first Masters 1000 title on hardcourt,"" he said. ""I made this huge step forward.

This file photo taken on January 18, 2020 shows medical staff members carrying a patient into the Jinyintan hospital, where patients infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan in China's central Hubei province are being treated. Photo by STR/AFP BEIJING, China – The death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic soared to 304 on Sunday, February 2, as an increasing number of countries imposed extraordinary Chinese travel bans to combat the spread of the disease. With Britain, Russia and Sweden among the countries confirming their first infections, the virus has now spread to more than two dozen nations, sending governments scurrying to limit their exposure. The United States and Australia are leading a growing list of countries that are putting temporary but sweeping travel restrictions on Chinese nationals or those who have travelled to China within the last two weeks. ""Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of US citizens and permanent residents...will be denied entry into the United States Health Secretary Alex Azar had announced. Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China, while Australian citizens who had travelled there would be required to go into ""self-isolation"" for two weeks. Vietnam suspended all flights from mainland China effective Saturday, February 1, while Russia announced it would halt visa-free tourism for Chinese nationals and stop issuing them work visas. Similar expansive restrictions have been announced by countries including Italy, Singapore, and China's northern neighbour Mongolia. The United States, Japan, Britain, Germany and other nations had already advised their citizens not to travel to China. Thousands of Hong Kong medical workers voted to commence a 4-day strike from Monday to push the government to close its border with mainland China to stop the virus, which has already spread to the financial hub. Britain said Saturday it was temporarily withdrawing some diplomatic staff and their families from across China, a day after the US State Department ordered embassy employees to send home family members under the age of 21. 'Unkind' Beijing insists it can contain the virus and called Washington's advice against travel to China ""unkind."" The US emergency declaration also requires Americans returning from Hubei province to be placed in mandatory 14-day quarantine, and health screening for American citizens coming from other parts of China. The virus emerged in early December and has been traced to a market in Hubei's capital Wuhan that sold wild animals. It spread globally on the wings of a Lunar New Year holiday rush that sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel domestically and overseas. The economic fallout continued as Apple announced that all its China stores would be closed until February 9. China's central bank said it would offer financial support to businesses hit by the public health emergency. Mea culpa With public anger mounting in China, Wuhan's top official admitted late Friday, January 31, that authorities there had acted too slowly. ""If strict control measures had been taken earlier the result would have been better than now,"" said Ma Guoqiang, the Communist Party chief for Wuhan. Wuhan officials have been criticised online for withholding information about the outbreak until late December despite knowing of it weeks earlier. China finally lurched into action last week, effectively quarantining whole cities in Hubei and tens of millions of people. Unprecedented safeguards imposed nationwide include postponing the return to school, cutting bus and train routes, and tightening health screening on travellers nationwide. Authorities in Hubei have extended the new year holiday until February 13 and suspended marriage registrations from Monday to discourage public gatherings. The city of Huanggang, east of Wuhan, said only one member of each household would be permitted to leave the house every two days to buy necessities. But the toll keeps mounting, with health authorities in Hubei on Sunday reporting 45 more deaths in the preceding 24 hours. The number of confirmed infections across China passed 14,300 on Sunday, the National Health Commission announced – far higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2002-03. SARS, which is caused by a pathogen similar to the new coronavirus and also originated in China, killed 774 people worldwide – most of them in mainland China and Hong Kong. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency on Thursday but later warned that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmission and could accelerate the virus's spread. But authorities around the world pressed ahead with preventive measures. 'Latent racism' Thai health officials on Friday said a taxi driver became the kingdom's first case of human-to-human transmission. Thailand joins China, Vietnam, Germany, Japan, France and the United States with confirmed domestic infections. The health crisis has dented China's international image and put Chinese nationals in difficult positions abroad, with complaints of racism. China flew overseas Hubei residents back to the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan on chartered planes from Thailand and Malaysia, citing ""practical difficulties"" the passengers had encountered overseas.

US President Donald Trump at the White House on December 06, 2019 in Washington, DC. File photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFP WASHINGTON, DC, USA – US officials have cited presidential privilege in withholding details of 24 emails related to President Donald Trump's hold on military assistance to Ukraine, US media reported on Saturday, February 1. The revelation in a court filing around midnight on Friday came just hours after US senators holding Trump's impeachment trial voted largely on party lines against hearing witnesses that could have shed further light on the hold, an issue at the heart of Trump's impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ""has redacted portions of 24 documents pursuant to the Presidential Communications Privilege,"" OMB's deputy general counsel Heather Walsh said in a court filing, cited by US media. The filing is in response to a freedom of information request for documents related to the Ukraine aid. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives for abuse of power related to his withholding of $391 million in congressionally-approved security aid to Ukraine. Democrats said he conditioned the aid on Ukraine's announcing investigations, including into his potential 2020 election challenger Joe Biden. ""Specifically, the documents in this category are emails that reflect communications by either the President, the Vice President, or the President's immediate advisors regarding Presidential decision-making about the scope, duration, and purpose of the hold on military assistance to Ukraine,"" Walsh wrote. She added that disclosure of documents identified as subject to presidential communications privilege ""in this case would risk harming the quality of the information and advice available to the president."" In response to media reports about the emails, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said: ""Every single Republican senator voted to endorse the White House cover-up of these potentially important truth-revealing emails. ""Make no mistake, the full truth will eventually come out and Republicans will have to answer for why they were so determined to enable the president to hide it."" The non-partisan Government Accountability Office ruled that OMB violated the law by withholding Ukraine assistance. According to The New York Times, former national security advisor John Bolton said Trump told him in August that he wanted to freeze military aid to Ukraine until Kiev helped with investigations of political rivals including Biden.

A Facebook employee walks by a sign displaying the 'Like' sign at Facebook's corporate headquarters campus in Menlo Park, California. File photo by Josh Edelson/AFP WASHINGTON, DC, USA – Facebook's massive settlement in a class action case over violating a state law on how it uses facial recognition is being hailed as a watershed moment for ""biometric privacy."" The leading social network said Wednesday, January 29, it agreed to the $550 million payout after failing to win dismissal of the case alleging it illegally collected biometric information for ""face tagging"" in violation of a 2008 Illinois privacy law. The settlement could have wide-ranging implications for Facebook and other tech firms using facial recognition technology, and highlights the potential for state laws to force changes in privacy practices. Plaintiff attorney Jay Edelson said the case helps establish the principle of biometric privacy, or the right of users of tech services and products to control access to their data used for facial recognition. ""Biometrics is one of the two primary battlegrounds, along with geolocation, that will define our privacy rights for the next generation,"" Edelson said in a statement. ""We hope and expect that other companies will follow Facebook's lead and pay significant attention to the importance of our biometric information."" Attorney Nathan Wessler of the American Civil Liberties Union, which backed the plaintiffs' legal arguments, said the settlement could mark a turning point for consumers and biometrics. ""Companies are going to have to take this seriously,"" Wessler said. ""Hopefully a settlement of this size will be a deterrent."" The deal is one of the largest settlements in a US privacy case, topped only by Facebook's $5 billion deal with the Federal Trade Commission on its data practices. Both are awaiting court approval. Facial recognition growing The legal case comes amid an array of deployments of biometric technologies such as facial recognition for law enforcement and border control, but also for ""tagging"" in social networks and in applications for retail stores or unlocking personal devices and cars. Several US cities including San Francisco have passed bans on the use of facial recognition technology. There are concerns about creating large databases with the potential for errors in identifying some individuals. ""We have seen growing recognition in the courts and in the public for the last few years on the need for reasonable but strong limits on the collection and use of our most private information,"" Wessler said. The Illinois law does not apply to government entities or contractors. At least two other states have similar laws, but Illinois is the only one allowing for private lawsuits for damages when companies collect data without consent. Alan Butler of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which also supported the plaintiff arguments, called the case ""hugely significant"" with a potential impact for all Facebook users. Butler noted that the courts ruled the case could proceed merely on the basis of showing a violation, without evidence of specific harms. Unintended consequences? But the Illinois law and similar restrictions may have negative consequences as well, according to Daniel Castro of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank often aligned with industry. The ability to sue without showing damages has unleashed a flood of litigation and some firms ""are even blocking their services in Illinois to avoid the risk of penalties. That's not good for consumers,"" Castro said. ""At the same time, it does not do much to actually address many specific concerns, such as police use of facial recognition to track citizens."" Castro said the ""patchwork"" of state laws could make it difficult for tech firms to launch new products, leaving them at a disadvantage compared to their Chinese counterparts. The settlement comes as US lawmakers are debating federal privacy legislation, with some proposals that could pre-empt laws such as those in Illinois. Wessler argued that some states have been taking the lead in offering strong privacy rules, and that a federal law could weaken overall data protection. ""The worst outcome would be a weak federal law with no private right of action, and which pre-empts state law, even though that is what the industry is seeking,"" he said. – Rappler.com "

In the best actor category, Phoenix is up against Leonardo DiCaprio (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Adam Driver (Marriage Story), Taron Egerton (Rocketman), and Jonathan Pryce (The Two Popes). The best actress nominees are Zellweger for her turn as Judy Garland in Judy, Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story), Saoirse Ronan (Little Women) and Charlize Theron (""Bombshell""). Tom Hanks, Anthony Hopkins, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and Brad Pitt are vying for the best supporting actor BAFTA. The best supporting actress gong will be disputed between Johansson for the six-times nominated Jojo Rabbit, Laura Dern, Florence Pugh and Margot Robbie.

Basically, it is a home quarantine for Filipinos who are coming from China, Hong Kong, and Macau,"" explained Monreal. The Philippines joins a growing list of countries that have put in place temporary but sweeping travel restrictions on travelers coming from China within the last two weeks. The United States and Australia were among countries that imposed such bans following the the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration the outbreak as a global emergency. Despite this, the WHO warned that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmission and could accelerate the virus's spread. Other measures taken.

Duterte advised all government institutions and local government unites to adopt, coordinate, and implement the task force's guidelines until the threat of the virus was over.

Ricardo Oñate, the Regional Field Office 11 director of the DA, said in a statement issued by its regional office that a composite team of veterinarians also reported ASF incidence in the barangays of Malita – Bito, Kidalapong, Tubalan, Felis, Mana, Talogoy, and New Argao. “Laboratory examinations of affected animals revealed similarities of lesions for classical swine fever or hog cholera and ASF,” he said. Oñate said it was later confirmed that blood samples collected and submitted to the Bureau of Animal Industry's animal disease diagnostic laboratory in General Santos City in Region 12 on January 30. Results turned positive for ASF. While the entry of ASF in Malita and earlier, in Don Marcelino town, had been confirmed, the DA said it was still clueless as to how the disease managed to sneak in. He said Secretary William Dar has already ordered Ronnie Domingo, the national director of the Bureau of Animal Industry, to conduct a ""trace-back"" and ""trace-forward"" investigations, particularly in areas where Don Marcelino actively trades with – such as the towns of Malita, Santa Maria, Jose Abad Santos, all in Davao Occidental; and Sulop, in Davao Del Sur. It was in Don Marcelino where the disease had initially been reported. The DA said it suspected the practices of local traders contributed to the spread of the deadly swine disease. “Backyard farmers in the area practice group rearing (Pagalam system) of hogs, from different owners, most having no proper housing provisions nor biosecurity practices. They do not also practice vaccination, vitamin supplementation and deworming. Household butchering is common especially with animals exhibiting weakness or disease, and animals are sold to neighbors and relatives,” Oñate said. He said in the affected towns, the means of trading animals is by viajeros (bukag-bukag). The viajeros would purchase sick animals at low cost and transport them by motorcycle to consolidators in the nearby town of Santa Maria for distribution to several areas in Davao Del Sur, he added. Mindanao Development Authority Chairman Emmanuel Piñol, who visited Don Marcelino, on Sunday called on hog industry stakeholders to help contain the disease by lending their “power sprayers, preferably motorized, disinfectants, empty drums, wide galvanized pans for footbaths and tents."" ""Foodstuff, including coffee, and cooking utensils for volunteers could also help. We also need suggestions on how to effectively dispose of sick hogs,"" Piñol said. ""We all have to contribute to contain this problem before it spreads."" He stressed that it was important to contain the problem and prevent ""the spread of the disease by immediately implementing quarantine measures.""""Just as we have done in Central Luzon, we will be employing policemen and soldiers to make sure nothing comes out of Don Marcelino and its neighboring town Jose Abad Santos,"" Piñol said. Aside from tracing back and forward, Oñate said Davao regional veterinary quarantine officers (VQOs)will also help identify the disposal sites for culled hogs and conduct an inventory of the total swine population in affected areas. As of Sunday, the total number of pigs that died from the disease was uncertain although initially, there were 1,000 reported by the Don Marcelino local government in the eight affected barangays of Linadasan, North Lamidan, South Lamidan, Calian, Mabuhay, Lawa, Nueva Villa and Baluntaya. “Secretary Dar orders all concerned DA offices to extend technical assistance to affected hog raisers, ensure food safety at all times, and strictly enforce the 1-7-10 protocol. He also reiterates that ASF is non-transmissible to humans, and that pork is safe to eat. Finally, he urges all consumers to always look for the seal of the DA's National Meat Inspection Service (DA-NMIS) that ensures all livestock and poultry animals are disease-free before they are slaughtered,” Oñate said. Noel Ocampo Reyes, the DA spokesperson, said the agency remained on top of the situation. He said Dar also commended Davao Occidental Governor Claude Bautista, and respective mayors of the two towns for enforcing a complete, but temporary, lockdown, and in establishing 24/7 quarantine checkpoints. – Rappler.com "

""I understand getting the scoop but please allow us time to make personal notifications to their loved ones,"" he wrote. ""It's very cold to hear of the loss via media. Breaks my heart."" TMZ did not respond to AFP's request for comment on its reporting or protocols on the story. But the website, founded in 2005, has a track record of being quickest to grisly celebrity deaths. It broke details of Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, and Prince passing before mainstream outlets. Other famous scoops included Mel Gibson's drunk-driving arrest and anti-Semitic tirade, and Chris Brown's physical assault on then-girlfriend Rihanna. Experts say this stems from its extensive network of news gatherers and sources, particularly in Los Angeles. Unconfirmed reports claim these include airport officials, limo drivers, and court officials. Los Angeles police and justice officials have lost their jobs after allegedly providing confidential information to the website. ""TMZ effectively – when it comes to entertainment news that is headline-breaking, like the Kobe story – they run this town,"" said Hollywood entertainment journalist and producer Simon Thompson. ""They have people everywhere."" 'Merciless approach' The outlet is also known for paying tipsters, often generous fees reaching thousands of dollars, in what a New Yorker profile called a ""merciless approach to celebrity news."" Founder Harvey Levin – a lawyer by training and former reporter – told Fox News in 2014 there was ""nothing wrong"" with paying sources for surveillance camera footage or photos. ""The video is still the video. So who cares whether you pay money for it?"" Levin did not respond to a request for comment by AFP. While mainstream journalism typically frowns on some of these practices, TMZ is not unique in doing so and has also drawn reluctant praise for its work on important stories. It broke allegations of racism against ex-Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, and ""Seinfeld"" star Michael Richards. Owned by WarnerMedia, TMZ's name comes from an old industry term, ""Thirty Mile Zone,"" designating the limits of Hollywood's entertainment district. The brand now operates television shows and Los Angeles celebrity-themed bus tours. While TMZ's reporting methods are not to everyone's tastes, its impact is difficult to ignore. ""Their track record is pretty consistent,"" said Thompson. ""Whether you agree with how they do it or not, they have a very strong network of people in places where they need to be to get pretty accurate information pretty quickly."" – Rappler.com "

Adem Altan/AFP BEIJING, China – The coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 300 people and infected more than 14,000 in mainland China and beyond, forcing governments around the world to take drastic measures. From border closures to flight bans, here are some of the steps states have taken to limit the spread of the virus (READ: The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?): Travel bans The United States on Friday, January 31, temporarily banned the entry of foreign nationals who had travelled to China over the past two weeks. Major restrictions were also placed on US nationals, with mandatory 14-day quarantines for those returning from the Chinese province at the epicenter of the outbreak. The only foreign nationals exempted from the ban are immediate family members of American citizens and permanent residents. Australia and Israel followed suit with a similar ban on non-citizens who have travelled to China in the last 14 days. Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Mongolia have announced similar restrictions on people travelling from China. Border closures Some nations have closed their borders with China in a bid to protect their territory from the outbreak. Russia said Thursday, January 30, it was closing its frontiers with China in the Far East, while Kazakhstan has halted cross-border bus and passenger train services to China. Mongolia has closed its border with China to cars, while North Korea – an isolated nation which relies heavily on its links with China – banned foreign tourists. Vietnam on the weekend announced a suspension of all mainland China flights. Nepal closed its Rasuwagadhi checkpoint on the Chinese border for 15 days starting January 29. Papua New Guinea went further than the others: it shut its air and seaports on Wednesday to all foreign travellers coming from Asia. The impoverished nation also shut its only land border with the Indonesia-controlled province of West Papua. Visa bans for Chinese A number of countries have temporarily stopped issuing visas to Chinese nationals after the coronavirus outbreak. Singapore has stopped issuing all types of visas to Chinese travellers, while Vietnam – a popular destination for Chinese tourists – has halted tourist visas. Russia, a close Beijing ally, announced Saturday, February 1, it would halt visa-free tourism for Chinese nationals and also stop issuing them work visas. It had already stopped issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals that allowed them to cross the border in parts of the Far East and western Russia. Similar visa restrictions of varying scale have been imposed by the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and the African nation of Mozambique. – Rappler.com "

The global lineup has a 3-2 edge since the format began in 2015, but the Americans will have their chance to level the rivalry on February 14 as a tuneup for the NBA All-Star Game two days later in Chicago. New Orleans Pelicans forward Williamson, the top pick in the NBA Draft last year, was selected as an US team injury replacement for Chicago center Wendell Carter Jr, who is out with a sprained right ankle. In 5 debut NBA games since starting his season 3 months late due to a knee injury, 19-year-old Williamson has averaged 18.0 points and 8.3 rebounds for the Pelicans. Washington Wizards forward Hachimura, who turns 22 on February 8, is expected to return this weekend from a groin injury that has sidelined him for the past 6 weeks. Hachimura, averaging 13.9 points and 5.8 rebounds, is the first Japanese player in the Rising Stars event.

1057,250792,"February 02, 2020",Philippines,Taal Volcano unrest enters 4th week,Acor Arceo,"Volcanic earthquakes still persist, indicating the movement of magma beneath Taal Volcano's crater, says Phivolcs on Sunday, February 2  DANGER ZONE. An aerial view shows the landscape of Barangay Buso-Buso in Laurel, Batangas, covered in ash on January 19, 2020. Photo by Ed Jones/AFP MANILA, Philippines – State volcanologists maintained Alert Level 3 for Taal Volcano in the province of Batangas on Sunday, February 2, as the unrest entered its 4th week. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said the Taal Volcano Network recorded 153 volcanic earthquakes in the past 24 hours, lower than the 182 in the previous 24-hour period. The volcanic earthquakes included two low-frequency events. This type of volcanic earthquake is ""caused by cracks resonating as magma and gases move toward the surface,"" according to the United States Geological Survey. Phivolcs stressed on Sunday that the continuing earthquakes show ""magmatic activity...that could lead to eruptive activity at the main crater."" At the main crater, there was ""weak emission of white steam-laden plumes 50 to 100 meters tall"" in the past 24 hours. In the previous 24-hour period, the plumes had only been up to 50 meters tall. The sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission also rose a bit, though still at a relatively low level. It was measured at an average of 97 tons per day, compared to the previous figure of 65 tons per day. SO2 is a major gas component of magma. It indicates magma is relatively near the surface of a volcano. Phivolcs reminded the public that these may still occur: Taal started erupting last January 12, when Alert Levels 2, 3, and 4 were raised in a span of just 5 hours. The volcano stayed under Alert Level 4 for two weeks, then it was downgraded to Alert Level 3 on January 26. When Phivolcs downgraded Taal, however, it warned that the threat of a hazardous eruption remains. There is merely a ""decreased tendency"" towards such an eruption, but the unrest has not stopped. The highest possible status is Alert Level 5, which would be raised when a hazardous eruption is in progress. For now, areas in Batangas within a 7-kilometer radius from Taal's main crater remain off-limits. These include: The number of people who have been affected by the ongoing Taal eruption rose to 127,974 families or 478,876 persons on Sunday, said the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. They are in the provinces of Batangas, Quezon, Laguna, and Cavite. Those staying in evacuation centers have gone down to 7,583 families or 26,588 persons as of Sunday. When a 14-kilometer-radius danger zone was enforced during Alert Level 4, there were as many as over 38,000 families in evacuation centers.

Jayson Tatum tallied 25 points, Marcus Smart had 16 points, and Brad Wanamaker chipped in 15 as the Celtics avoided a season sweep by Philadelphia. The Celtics played without injured leading scorer Kemba Walker, who has a sore left knee. Ben Simmons led the 76ers with 23 points, while Joel Embiid was held to 11 on a dismal 1-of-11 shooting. Philadelphia was done in by poor shooting. It attempted 33 shots from three-point range but made just 7. The 76ers had beaten the Celtics in their first 3 meetings this season, including December 12 at the Boston Garden. Meanwhile, Kawhi Leonard scored at least 30 points for the ninth straight contest as the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Minnesota Timberwolves, 118-106. Leonard, who also had 6 rebounds, needed just 24 minutes of playing time to score 31 points. Paul George, playing in his second contest after missing 9 games because of a left hamstring strain, had 21 points and 7 rebounds in 25 minutes. Lou Williams added 17 points, Montrezl Harrell contributed 16 points and 6 rebounds, and Patrick Beverley finished with 12 points and 5 rebounds in the win.

Shabazz Napier had 11 points. Also, Draymond Green equaled his career best with 16 assists as the Golden State Warriors surprised the Cleveland Cavaliers, 131-112. Green dished out a half dozen assists during a 44-point scoring blitz by the Warriors, who shot 10-for-16 on three-pointers in their third-quarter surge.

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) greets rally attendees after speaking at a campaign rally at the U.S. Bank Arena on February 1, 2020 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Over 3,000 people were in attendance at the event. Photo by Tom Brenner/Getty Images/AFP IOWA CITY, USA – Democratic candidates bolt on Sunday, February 2, across Iowa, where no handshake or pit stop is too insignificant one day ahead of the state's presidential nominating process, which is the first in the nation. Iowa has traditionally served as a vital launching point – or burial ground – for presidential campaigns. However, Monday's crunch vote has created an air of suspense, with no clear frontrunner. Leftist senator Bernie Sanders holds only a narrow lead over former vice president Joe Biden, among the field of several candidates feverishly criss-crossing the rural state. Three of the leading candidates seized on a brief break from their duties as jurors in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump in Washington to rush to Iowa for a flurry of last-minute events. The senators – the self-styled democratic socialist Sanders, progressive Elizabeth Warren and moderate Amy Klobuchar – each held a handful of events Saturday. The impeachment trial – only the third in US history – created an unprecedented situation by limiting the senators' ability to campaign in Iowa in the closing days before the state's presidential caucuses. Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar have to return to Washington on Monday, along with Senator Michael Bennet who trails badly in the polls, for the trial's resumption. Senate leaders have scheduled a vote for Wednesday that appears virtually certain to end in Trump's acquittal on the impeachment charges of abuse of power and contempt of Congress. 'It all begins' Eight of the 11 Democrats still in the race were in Iowa on Saturday. A good result can propel a candidate to new victories in the states that follow, starting with tiny New Hampshire eight days later. A poor showing can signal the end. Sanders, at 78 the oldest Democratic candidate, has seen his candidacy buoyed by enthusiastic support among young voters. His staff organized concerts at his weekend rallies with indie groups Bon Iver and Vampire Weekend, who also performed at his events four years ago. ""We must defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of America"" the Vermont senator told a crowd of several thousand in Cedar Rapids. ""Monday night in Iowa it all begins"" he said. Monday evening, at 7:00 pm (0100 GMT Tuesday or 9 am Philippine time), the state's more than 600,000 registered Democrats are invited to take part in caucuses at about 1,700 venues – schools, theaters, churches – to publicly express their choice by standing under one candidate's banner. The best against Trump Just as in every presidential year, thousands of volunteers fanned out across the Midwestern farm state of just over 3 million inhabitants to try to convince neighbors or passers-by to vote for their favorite. At this late date, nearly one Iowa voter in two claimed to still be undecided. In a home in Iowa City that Warren supporters were using as a base, people streamed in and out, looking for more posters to put up on lamp posts or in yards, or for lists of doors that still needed to be knocked on. ""We are trying to get around the state as much as we can,"" Warren told a rally of nearly 1,000 at a high school in Iowa City, adding that the Democratic Party's job is ""to come together to beat Donald Trump.""  TOWN HALL. Democratic presidential candidate Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren speaks at a town hall in Davenport, Iowa, on February 1, 2020. Photo by Jim Watson/AFP If one thing unifies the Democrats, it's that desire to defeat Trump, state Democratic chairman Troy Price told Agence France-Presse. That is the number one argument being made by Biden, former vice president to Barack Obama. ""We need a president who is ready on Day One,"" the 77-year-old political veteran has been saying throughout his campaign. Biden leads in nationwide surveys but trails Sanders in the latest Iowa polling. New faces Iowans take their politics seriously. They take their role as first-in-the-nation voters to heart, and often, even in the smallest cities, have the chance to meet candidates in person. Their pick has a recent historical track record of going on to become the Democratic Party nominee. Like Biden, 38-year-old Pete Buttigieg took advantage of the absence of rivals stuck in the Senate to lay on a heavy schedule of campaigning. A former consultant, army reservist and onetime mayor of a small Indiana city, ""Mayor Pete"" portrays his youth as a reason voters should prefer him over the graying Biden. As for Sanders, his politics are too divisive, Buttigieg implies. His is not the only new face to emerge during the campaign. Klobuchar, 59, a previously little-known senator, has climbed slowly but steadily in voter polls. She is hoping for a surprise on Monday, boosted in part by the fact that her home state, Minnesota, borders Iowa. Maria Watt, 42, was leaning toward ""Pete"" until she decided to switch to ""Amy."" ""Either way, we'd be happy to have it be a young person or a female,"" the Iowa City voter said Saturday. ""Anyone but an old white guy."" – Rappler.com "

Robredo likewise downplayed calls for her to lead the country as she urged the Duterte government to take swift precautions against the spread of the coronavirus in the Philippines. Robredo was referring to a Twitter poll where respondents said they wanted her to lead the country following dissatisfaction over the government's current handling of the situation.

The solution is to act swiftly and aggressively because the public is worried.... We're not saying the government isn't doing anything but until Filipinos know what is being done, the fear is there.) Robredo urged President Rodrigo Duterte to publicly address the Filipino people when making statements, saying the public was only looking for assurances the government was taking all necessary steps to protect them. ""Alam natin na very popular si Pangulo, na kapag siya iyong mag-assure sa mga kababayan natin na lahat ginagawa ng pamahalaan, tingin ko hindi ganoon kagrabe iyong takot, eh,"" Robredo said.

The patient's death marks the first confirmed death outside of China due to the coronavirus. The WHO stressed, though, the case was not a ""locally-acquired"" as the fatality came from Wuhan. Robredo reminded the public to practice proper personal hygiene and urged Filipinos to stay calm amid the spread of the coronavirus.

Photo by Karim Sahib/AFP DUBAI, UAE – A band of Muppets, both old favorites and new friends, will star in an Arabic retooling of Sesame Street with a regional twist. In its Western iterations, the long-running franchise addresses issues including family breakdown. The new Middle East version instead seeks to help children, especially young Syrian refugees, cope with emotions. New characters will join Cookie Monster (Kaa'ki), Grover (Gargur), Elmo and others in the new show in Arabic, called Ahlan Simsim! (Welcome Sesame). ""We always play and sing and try new things and have many adventures,"" new puppet Basma, a 5-year-old purple girl with a twin twist hairstyle, told AFP on a publicity tour in Dubai. ""We have a lot of friends in the neighborhood, but Jad is my best friend,"" she added of her new co-star, a yellow boy with a tuft of canary-colored hair. Basma, Jad, and their gluttonous goat friend Ma'zooza, will take to the airwaves 6 days a week on Middle East satellite channel MBC 3 from Sunday, February 2. The show is a partnership between the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Sesame Workshop, which is responsible for the program worldwide. The aim is to offer ""nurturing care to children and caregivers affected by the Syrian conflict"", according to a statement. Since erupting in 2011, the war has displaced over 5.1 million Syrian children, with 2.5 million of them now living in regional host countries including Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. 'Emotional ABCs' ""Jad and I are not that similar. He is an artist and a painter. I love to sing and dance and he likes things in order. He thinks and plans while I get bored,"" said Basma. Sesame Street mainstay Grover, meanwhile, sets out to interview children from across the Arab world, tackling myriad issues including jealousy and how to care for loved ones. ""We are all different from each other,"" Grover told AFP. ""Some of us like to sing and some of us like to dance and some like to exercise,"" added the gangly blue character, beloved of children and grownups since his 1970 Sesame Street debut. ""But I discovered we are all alike because we love each other."" The new show is produced in Jordan and is the result of a two-year-long collaboration with numerous child development specialists. ""We have the emotional 'ABCs' and at the same time we present coping mechanisms to deal with these emotions. In every episode, we have a coping mechanism,"" said executive producer Khaled Haddad. He said Arab children had difficulty expressing their emotions. ""They don't know what their emotion is, the child does not know he is terrified or angry or even jealous. Through our episodes we talk about these emotions and how to deal with them,"" he added. 'Inhale and exhale' In one episode, Basma and Jad learn from big brother figure Hadi how to handle fear. ""You put your hand on your tummy then you take a breath through your nose -- inhale and exhale. It calms you down,"" Basma said, demonstrating the technique. Jad's character, who didn't join the trip to Dubai, is portrayed as new to the community. But ""we don't label him as a refugee in the show"", Haddad stressed. ""He is new to the neighbourhood, meets all the kids and becomes friends with them."" He noted that across the region, ""you have kids going from one place to another"". ""Our show speaks to all the children of the Arab world"", he added. ""This is not for a certain group"". The first Arabic version of Sesame Street, known as Iftah ya Simsim (Open Sesame), aired in the region from 1979 until 1990 and enjoyed immense popularity.

Kuwait serves up insect delicacy",Rappler.com,"The surprisingly nutritious, protein-rich insect is considered a 'delicious delicacy' by Kuwait's older citizens  DELICACY. Locust consumption is dwindling across Kuwaiti society among the younger generation, but the senior citizens stand by the protein-rich insect. Photo by Yasser Al-Zayyat/AFP KUWAIT CITY, Kuwait – Some people like them baked, others prefer them dried. Locusts are surprisingly nutritious and considered a delicacy by many in Kuwait but not everyone is enamored by the crunchy culinary offering. ""I love their flavor, it's one of my memories of childhood and reminds me of my grandparents and my father,"" enthused Moudi al-Miftah, a 64-year-old journalist who writes a weekly newspaper column. Miftah awaits winter every year to stock up on locusts, which she cooks herself, with a preference for crispiness. In her kitchen, she tipped a bag of the insects into boiling stock where they quickly turned red, filling her kitchen with an aroma similar to stewing mutton. After simmering for half an hour, the locusts are ready to eat but they can be baked for added crunch, or dried so they can be enjoyed year-round. But most of Miftah's loved ones stopped eating the bugs long ago. Locust consumption is dwindling across Kuwaiti society, particularly among the younger generation, many of whom are disgusted by the prospect. Ali Saad, a man in his twenties who was shopping for groceries, was visibly repulsed by the idea of snacking on insects. ""I've never thought of eating locusts,"" he said. ""Why would I eat an insect when we have all kinds of red and white meats?"" 'The flesh is very tasty' Locusts are consumed in many parts of the world and are a staple of some cuisines. Experts say they are an excellent, energy-efficient source of protein. In Kuwait, they retain a sturdy fan base among older citizens. The first shipments, imported from Saudi Arabia, arrive in markets in January, transported in distinctive red bags weighing 250 grams (9 ounces). They are stocked alongside white desert truffles, another delicacy sought by Kuwaitis in winter at the Al-Rai market nestled in an industrial area in the northwest of Kuwait City. Abou Mohammed, 63, is originally from Ahvaz in Iran and normally sells fish at the market. But when the season arrives, he becomes a locust and truffle salesman. ""The locusts are caught during the winter nights (when they are not flying) and we import them from Saudi Arabia,"" he said. He described the bugs as ""like a shrimp"" and enthused that ""the flesh is very tasty –especially the females which are full of eggs"". The larger females are known as ""el-Mekn"" in Kuwaiti dialect, while the smaller males are called ""Asfour"". Abou Mohammed says he sells almost a dozen bags a day at between 3 and 5 Kuwaiti dinars ($8 and $16) each. ""I sell some 500 bags over the season, which is from January to April,"" he said. 'Stockpiling for next year' Mohammed al-Awadi, a 70-year-old Kuwaiti, has delivered locusts to retailers for many years and keeps a handy supply of the dried insects in his pocket for snacking. Dubbed ""the king of the market"", the salesman demonstrated how to eat the bug –snacking on a first locust, then another, and another. ""It's the best of dishes. I'm full, so I don't need to eat lunch today,"" he said. ""The drier they are the better. My father always had a supply in his pocket."" Authorities have sought in vain to ban the consumption of locusts over fears they could be contaminated. Locusts can rapidly multiply and form swarms that damage crops, forcing some countries to tackle them with pesticides. Adel Tariji put his stock of two black sacks beside his vehicle and prospective clients pulled up alongside to examine his produce and haggle over prices. Tariji, who has sold locusts since he was 18, said that despite reticence from some, he had seen glimmers of interest from health-conscious younger buyers. They are more willing to pay higher prices because they are convinced of the benefits of eating ""all natural"" products, he said. ""Some people are even stockpiling for next year out of fear that there will be no locusts next season."" – Rappler.com "

Lamar Jackson totalled 3,127 passing yards for a league-leading 36 touchdowns for the Ravens in the ongoing NFL season. Photo from Twitter/@Ravens MIAMI, USA – Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson swept the board to be named the NFL Most Valuable Player award for 2019 on Saturday, February 1, in recognition of his record-breaking season. The 23-year-old became only the second player in NFL history to be a unanimous pick for the honor after Tom Brady in 2010, winning all 50 first-place votes. Jackson's MVP award came at a ceremony in Miami on the eve of the Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs. The Ravens quarterback had been seen as a shoo-in for the award after a year which saw him rush for 1,206 yards to break Michael Vick's single-season rushing record. Jackson also totalled 3,127 passing yards for a league-leading 36 touchdowns. Elsewhere Saturday, the San Francisco 49ers' marauding defensive end Nick Bosa received a pre-Super Bowl boost with two awards. Bosa picked up Defensive Rookie of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors. He amassed 47 tackles, 9 sacks, an interception, and a forced fumble during a stellar debut regular season after being selected by the 49ers with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2019 draft. The 22-year-old from Fort Lauderdale wins the Defensive Rookie of the Year award 4 years after elder brother Joey of the Los Angeles Chargers won the same honor. New Orleans Saints wide receiver Michael Thomas earned Offensive Player of the Year after a season which saw him set a new record for receptions with 149 catches and 1,725 receiving yards. Thomas new mark eclipsed Marvin Harrison's record of 143 takes set in 2002. Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, the No.1 pick in the draft last year, won the Offensive Rookie of the Year award after a debut season which saw him finish with 349 completions and 3,722 passing yards. His completions total is the third-highest-ever accumulated by a rookie quarterback. Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh took home the Coach of the Year award after his team finished with a 14-2 record, including a 12-game winning streak. The Ravens' season came to an abrupt end in the playoffs when they were eliminated by the Tennessee Titans in the first round. The 57-year-old Harbaugh is one of the longest-serving head coaches in the NFL, having been appointed by the Ravens in 2008.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (R) reacts after holding a joint news conference with Kazakh Foreign Minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi (L) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, February 2, 2020. Photo by Kevin Lamarque/AFP NUR SULTAN, Kazakhstan – US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on countries to offer asylum to ethnic minorities fleeing China's troubled Xinjiang region during a visit Sunday to oil-rich Kazakhstan -- a country that borders the region. ""We ask simply for them to provide safe refuge and asylum for those seeking to flee China,"" Pompeo said at a press appearance with Kazakh foreign minister Mukhtar Tleuberdi. ""Protect human dignity, just do what is right,"" Pompeo said. Pompeo was meeting top officials in ex-Soviet Kazakhstan as he rounds off a 5-nation tour in two countries where Russia and China enjoy privileged interests. His visit to the Kazakh capital Nur-Sultan also saw him meet with Kazakhs who say their family members are detained in Xinjiang, where over a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities are believed to have been incarcerated as part of an unprecedented security crackdown in the region. Kazakhstan has allowed several ethnic Kazakhs of Chinese citizenship who fled the region to stay in the country, but has not given any of them asylum – a reluctance local activists attribute to Chinese pressure. Pompeo also commended Kazakhstan's ""quick action"" over the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 300 people and infected more than 14,000 in mainland China and beyond, forcing governments around the world to take drastic measures. Kazakhstan has presently hospitalized over 40 people that returned to the country from China with flu-like symptoms, but has yet to confirm any cases of the disease. On Sunday evening Pompeo will fly to Uzbekistan, a country of 33 million that is emerging from nearly 3 decades of isolation. Pompeo also visited two other ex-Soviet countries – Belarus and Ukraine – as part of a trip that began with a stop in Britain. Ahead of the visit, Pompeo stressed that the Central Asian countries on his itinerary ""want to be sovereign and independent"", and Washington had ""an important opportunity to help them achieve that"". But he also acknowledged ""a lot of activity (in the region) – Chinese activity, Russian activity"". Washington has often struggled to keep a foothold in Central Asian states that were part of the Soviet Union up to its collapse in 1991. At the height of hostilities in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks, NATO and the United States maintained important logistics centres in the region, but these have now closed. Russia has retained military bases and heads security and trade blocs that have helped to entrench its position there. But Central Asia also increasingly looks east to China's trillion-dollar Belt and Road global trade plan as a panacea to treat battered economies. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan have both seen leadership transitions since John Kerry toured the region in 2015 -- the last US secretary of state to visit. In Kazakhstan, Pompeo was to meet President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as well as his predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who last year shocked Kazakhs by retiring from the presidency after nearly three decades in office. In Uzbekistan, he was to hold talks with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who has embarked on ambitious reforms, welcoming tourism and investment in the once-isolated republic while keeping the authoritarian system intact. Mirziyoyev's long-ruling hardline predecessor, Islam Karimov, turned his back on the United States in 2005 after a row over the Uzbek government's bloody crackdown on protests. The relationship had healed somewhat by the time of Karimov's death in 2016. Mirziyoyev, who visited Trump at the White House in 2018, has mused on the benefits of joining the Moscow-backed Eurasian Economic Union, a five-country bloc including Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan that is seen as a key vehicle for Russia to wield influence in the region. In addition to holding bilateral meetings, Pompeo on Monday in Tashkent will hold a meeting with foreign ministers from all five ex-Soviet Central Asian countries – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. This format was first tried under Kerry to enhance regional, economic, environmental and security cooperation. – Rappler.com "

Citing China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Reuters reported on Saturday, February 1, that an outbreak of a ""highly pathogenic strain"" of H5N1 happened at a farm in the city of Shaoyang in Hunan. The farm had 7,850 chickens, of which 4,500 have died due to the bird flu. Chinese authorities have culled nearly 18,000 poultry following the H5N1 outbreak there.

LeBron James had a triple-double of 15 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists, while Avery Bradley scored 16 of his 19 points in the first 12 minutes as the Lakers racked up 81 points in the first half.

Elsewhere, red-hot Damian Lillard continued blistering pace with 51 points to lead the Portland to a 124-107 victory over the Utah Jazz. Lillard connected on 17 of 29 field goal attempts and made all 8 of his free throws en route to his third 50-point performance over the past 6 games and fourth of the season. He is averaging 48.8 points during the six-game stretch. In Boston, Jaylen Brown scored 32 points as the Boston Celtics won their sixth game in the last 7 with a 116-95 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. Jayson Tatum tallied 25 points, Marcus Smart had 16 points, and Brad Wanamaker chipped in 15 as the Celtics avoided a season sweep by the 76ers. The Celtics played without injured leading scorer Kemba Walker, who has a sore left knee. Ben Simmons led the 76ers with 23 points, and Joel Embiid was held to 11 on a dismal 1-of-11 shooting. Philadelphia was done in by poor shooting. They attempted 33 shots from three-point range but made just 7.

Taduran, despite landing clearer and stronger punches, settled for a majority draw with homegrown Daniel Valladares after the bout was cut short to 4 rounds due to a deep cut sustained by the challenger following an accidental clash of heads in the opening round. One judge even sided with Valladares, 39-37, while the two other judges called it even, 38-38. Thus, Taduran will return to the country with the belt he won at the expense of compatriot Samuel Salva, and his reputation as a warrior intact. For a while, Taduran thought he won by technical knockout, praying in the corner as the referee signaled a stoppage while looking down at Valladares. As it turned out, the ring physician ordered a halt as Valladares was unfit to continue with the bloody cut over his right eye. The 23-year-old Taduran's record now stands at 14-2-1 with 11 knockouts while Valladares' ledger shows 22-1-1 with 13 knockouts, two of which came against Filipinos Christian Araneta and former world champion Merlito Sabillo in 2019. Valladares found out Taduran was on another level, however. While Taduran stuck to his game plan of going after the Mexican's body, the relentless southpaw mixed it up with head blows that often landed. Both fighters easily hit the 105-pound limit, with Taduran checking in at 104.6 pounds and Valladares coming in at 103.8.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement it would launch a 1.2-trillion-yuan reverse repurchase operation on Monday, February 3, to maintain ""reasonable and abundant liquidity"" in the banking system, as well as a stable currency market, during the epidemic. It added that the overall liquidity of the banking system would be 900 billion yuan ($129 billion) more than in the same period last year. The move will kick in on the day that China's financial markets reopen, following an extended Spring Festival break. The SARS-like virus, which originated from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has now infected over 14,000 people in the country and claimed more than 300 lives.

Authorities also relaxed tariffs on goods imported for use in the virus fight – including those from the United States, with which it has been engaged in a bruising trade war for around two years. The move to inject liquidity into its financial system comes as authorities work to shore up confidence in an already slowing economy. 'Short-term' hit The China Securities Regulatory Commission said Sunday that ""the epidemic's impact on the market is short-term, and will not affect the longer-term trend,"" reported the state-run People's Daily. But China's travel and tourism sectors have already taken a hit over an unusually quiet Spring Festival break this year, with large-scale events canceled, public attractions closed, and people urged to stay home to help contain the outbreak.

But unlike some other fathers, whose influence have been resented or even negative, Alex and Sofia, 21, remain close and affectionate. ""I really have him to thank. We've been dreaming about this – it's a dream come true for us,"" Sofia said. ""He's told me a lot of positive things. He knows exactly what he's talking about."" ""Even though I don't like to admit it sometimes, to tell him he's right. Yeah, he really works hard. Just thank you to him. We can share this forever."" 'People overlooked me' Alex Kenin arrived in New York from what was then the Soviet Union in 1987 with his wife, Lena, and a few hundred dollars in his pocket, searching for the ""American Dream."" He drove a taxi by night and went to English and computer school during the day, a period he describes as ""very, very tough."" ""I had to work at night, go to school in the morning. Driving in New York, speaking English on the [taxi] radio. I had no idea what they were saying,"" he said. ""But it's amazing the things you do to survive. [Sofia] knows about that and I think it made her tough."" Sofia clearly had talent from a young age, but they remained outsiders and making it on the tennis circuit was never easy. ""People overlooked me. I wasn't the tallest kid when I was little. People said, 'What are you talking about? She's so small. What are you doing? This is a joke,'"" Sofia said. ""We didn't have the best things said about me but my dad's been there and he believed in me, didn't listen to that. He could have easily said, okay, and I could have done something [else]."" Sofia represented America at the 2014 Youth Olympics, made her Grand Slam debut as a wildcard at the 2015 US Open and broke into the top 100 in March 2018. Her career really took off last year, when she won 3 singles titles and rose to a world ranking of 12. But despite her recent success, nobody predicted her victory in Melbourne. During the final, Alex could barely watch as Sofia closed on the win, and he filmed her winner's speech – which was beamed live worldwide – on his mobile phone. ""He was so happy. I was so happy. We shared this together. He was like, 'What just happened?'"" Sofia said. ""I'm also just on cloud nine."" ""He's just proud of me. I'm a tough cookie, but I did it."" – Rappler.com "

More than 480 people have died and nearly 30,000 have been wounded since the rallies began on October 1, but few have been held accountable for the bloodshed.

A major transportation hub, it is also where about 150 Filipinos live.  WUHAN. This aerial view taken in September 2019 shows the Yangtze River in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province. File photo by Hector Retamal/AFP MANILA, Philippines – All eyes are on Wuhan City in China after it was identified as the epicenter of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV), spreading to various countries, even beyond Asia. The first cases of the 2019 nCoV were reported by Chinese state media on December 31, after 44 people from Wuhan were confirmed to be infected. The city is currently on lockdown as authorities scramble to contain the novel coronavirus and at the same time, race to save those suffering from it. The World Health Organization already declared an international emergency over the deadly outbreak. (READ: Novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV: What we know so far) But beyond being tagged as ground zero of the latest coronavirus outbreak, what else do we need to know about Wuhan? Wuhan City is the capital of Hubei province located in Central China. It's about 838 kilometers west of Shanghai and 1,152 kilometers south of Beijing. The city has an area of 8,494 square kilometers and is divided into 13 districts, traversed by the great Yangtze and the Han Rivers. Its size is about half of Palawan's (17,030.75 square km). As of 2018, Wuhan’s population is estimated at 11 million, making it the 7th most populous city in China. Wuhan is one of the major manufacturing areas in China. In 2016, it was designated as a national central city under China’s national urban system plan, which means Wuhan is considered and expected to lead regional economic development, among others. The makeup of the city supports this goal since as of 2018, Wuhan is home to 3 national development zones, 4 scientific and technological development parks, and more than 300 research institutions, aside from enterprise incubators and enterprises. Its major industries include: automotive, advanced manufacturing, electronics, food processing, energy and environmental protection, and iron and steel, among others. Wuhan’s major exports, meanwhile, are machinery, organic chemicals, apparel, preserved foods, and automotive vehicles, often shipped to the United States, some parts of Europe, South Korea, India, Japan, Singapore, and Brazil. Among its biggest factories is the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, the state-owned automobile manufacturer which supplies key supplies to Western companies. MAIN HUB.

This photo taken in May 2014 shows passengers walking on the square outside Wuhan railway station in central China's Hubei province. File photo by AFP The city of Wuhan is considered a main transportation hub in China, earning the tag “jiu sheng tong qu” which refers to its accessibility to the country's 9 key provinces – Sichuan, Shanxi, Henan, Hunan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Hubei. Wuhan Railway Hub, managed by the China Railway Wuhan Group, is one of the 4 key railway hubs in China. It has 3 main passenger stations, with two servicing high-speed trains traversing key Chinese cities. More than two million people are estimated to use this transportation service at any given day before the virus outbreak. The city’s airport, Wuhan Tianhe International Airport, is considered one of the busiest in the country, being strategically located along China’s airline network. It opened in 1995 but only started doing international flights in 2000. Located 26 kilometers north of the Wuhan city center, the airport has ""non-stop passenger flights scheduled to 113 destinations in 22 countries,"" according to the FlightConnections website. In 2018, the international airport handled 24,500,356 passengers with at least 48 airlines using its facilities. Wuhan prides itself with its rich history, dating from when people first settled in the area more than 10,000 years ago. One of Wuhan’s districts, Wuchan, was the site of an uprising organized by imperial soldiers in 1911. The mutiny, according to historical records, was initiated by soldiers who sympathized with progressive leaders who were carrying out a protest movement against a railway crisis. The Wuchang Uprising is referred to as the turning point of the Xinhai Revolution, which eventually toppled the last imperial Qing dynasty, establishing the Republic of China and installing Sun Yat-sen as the first provisional president. In the past, Wuhan became the capital of China twice – in 1927 under the left-wing Kuomintang government which opposed the nationalist government led by Chiang Kai-shek, and as provisional capital during the 2nd Sino-Japanese War following the fall of Nanking in 1937. The Department of Foreign Affairs said that there are at least 150 Filipinos in Wuhan and another 150 in other parts of Hubei province. On January 28, the Philippine government said it is open to repatriate those who want to come home but they will be subjected to necessary screening and quarantine. Aside from Filipinos, there are also thousands of other foreigners who call Wuhan their temporary home, most of them students. Labeled as an education hub, Wuhan has more than 30 tertiary schools with students from all over the world. There are at least 1,500 foreign students in Wuhan University alone. In total, it welcomes about 3,000 foreign visitors for ""academic visits and exchanges"" annually. Many foreign countries have plans to repatriate their own nationals, including European countries, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey, among others. – Rappler.com  Other news you can use: "

The Kansas City Chiefs look to win their first Super Bowl title in 50 years. Photo from Instagram/@chiefs MIAMI, USA – The Kansas City Chiefs chase their first Super Bowl title in 50 years on Sunday, February 2 (Monday, February 2, Manila time) when they face the San Francisco 49ers in a championship clash poised to usher in a new era for the NFL. Around 100 million Americans are expected to tune in for the biggest event on the US sporting calendar, which kicks off at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium at 7:30 am (Manila time). The eagerly anticipated showdown could mark a changing of the guard for the NFL's quarterback hierarchy as the curtain comes down on the league's 100th season. With Tom Brady and the New England Patriots failing to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since 2016, the stage is set for the Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes to crown his emergence as the best quarterback in the league. The gifted 24-year-old Texan could become the second-youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl if he leads the Chiefs to victory in only his second full season as a starter. Mahomes, who became only the second quarterback in history to amass 5,000 passing yards and 50 touchdowns in a season in 2018, has cut a relaxed figure during this week's build-up. Having fun ""I'm going to go out there and try and have fun and play the way I've played all season long,"" Mahomes said earlier this week. True to form, Mahomes and his teammates laughed and joked their way through a final practice session on Saturday under the watchful eye of veteran head coach Andy Reid. ""They're loose, to a point,"" Reid said of his team. ""They know the job at hand against a real good football team, but at the same time, we try to let our personalities show."" ""That has been an emphasis and I don't expect them to stop doing that now."" Attempting to frustrate Mahomes and the Chiefs are a 49ers unit chasing a record-equaling sixth Super Bowl. Led by 28-year-old quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo – who won two Super Bowl rings during his stint as a back-up to Brady in New England – the 49ers boast a fearsome defense which will attempt to knock Mahomes out of his stride. Garoppolo has an array of weapons at his disposal. Against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship game, the 49ers blew away their opponents with a fearsome ground game that saw running back Raheem Mostert rush for 4 touchdowns and more than 200 yards. On the defensive side, the 49ers boast a fearsome pass rush led by Nick Bosa, who was given a pre-Super Bowl fillip on Saturday after being named Rookie of the Year at the NFL's annual awards. The 49ers are also bound to have a few offensive tricks up their sleeve as they prepare under the guidance of head coach Kyle Shanahan, one of the most innovative minds in the NFL. ""We're as ready as we can be,"" Shanahan said on Saturday. ""We just need the game to get here. It has been two weeks of [practice] and we are itching to go."" Shanahan took his players on a walkthrough at the Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday to prepare them for the extended halftime break in Sunday's game, where Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will perform for the sell-out 65,000 crowd. At around 30 minutes, the Super Bowl's halftime interval is more than double the usual interval. ""It's going to feel like forever,"" Shanahan said. ""We're not used to that."" Father-son double A win on Sunday would see the 49ers coach emulate his father Mike Shanahan, who won back-to-back Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos in 1998 and 1999. But Shanahan's coaching wizardry may prove moot if the 49ers defense is unable to contain Mahomes and a Chiefs offense bristling with pace in the form of receiver Tyreek Hill and power in the shape of tight end Travis Kelce. The Chiefs have averaged 43 points per game in two playoff contests and during the regular season averaged just over 28 points per game. Kansas City's ability to produce devastating bursts of scoring was showcased in its playoff game against Houston last month, when it came back from a 24-0 deficit to win 51-31. But the Chiefs are all too aware that conceding an early lead against the 49ers and their stingy defense could well be fatal. ""We obviously want our guys to go out there and have a faster start,"" said Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy. ""You certainly never ever want to spot a team 24 points."" – Rappler.com "
