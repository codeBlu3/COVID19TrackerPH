249832,2020-01-21,Philippines,DOH probes suspected case of novel coronavirus in Cebu City,Janella Paris,"(3rd UPDATE) Health Secretary Francisco Duque III says the suspected case involves a 5-year-old Chinese boy who arrived in Cebu City from Wuhan, China  DOH PRESSER. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III (right)with WHO Country Represenattive Dr Rabindra Abetasinghe briefs the media on January 21, 2020. Photo by KD Madrilejos/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) announced on Tuesday, January 21, that it is investigating a suspected case of novel coronavirus in Cebu City. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III announced in a news briefing on Tuesday that the case involved a 5-year-old Chinese boy who arrived in Cebu City from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of cases of the SARS-like virus. The child had fever, throat irritation, and cough prior to entering the Philippines, he said. ""The samples from the child tested negative for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The sample, though, had been sent to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia to identify what kind of coronavirus it is,"" he added. Health officials expected the test results to come out on Thursday, January 23. Duque said the patient ""is still experiencing cough but is currently stable and afebrile"" or no longer feverish. The DOH referred to the case as ""non-specific pancoronavirus,"" which means it could be the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or any of the 4 other existing coronaviruses that can infect humans. There are coronaviruses that can cause very mild symptoms, Duque said. “Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious infections such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Common signs of coronavirus infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties,” he added. Duque held the news briefing  a day after it was reported that the provincial health office of Aklan quarantined 3 Chinese travelers who were detected as having fever upon their arrival at the Kalibo International Airport. The Aklan provincial health office said on Monday, January 20, that throat swabs and blood samples were taken from the 3 who all came on different flights on January 17, 18, and 20.  They were later allowed to proceed to Boracay, their destination, after their fever and breathing difficulty subsided. The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) said test results on the samples from the 3 persons in Aklan were expected “within 24 to 48 hours.” Referring tothe Chinese travelers, Duque said, ""The signs and symptoms manifested by the 3 Chinese nationals did not fit the case definition as prescribed by the WHO interim guidelines on the new coronavirus."" He said the 3 ""had no history of travel to Wuhan, and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus case, Severe Acute Respiratory illness case, or sick animals."" The SARS-like viral disease caused by what the World Health Organization (WHO) and the medical community are calling the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was initially reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Chinese health officials said it could be transmitted between humans. Cases have since been reported in the cities of Beijing and Shanghai and the province of Guangdong. South Korea, Japan, and Thailand have also reported cases of the disease, which was found in people who visited Wuhan. So far, a total of 218 people have been diagnosed with the virus. This novel strain is the 7th known type of coronavirus that humans can contract. The 2019 nCoV, according to WHO, is “a never-before-seen strain belonging to a broad family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses such as SARS.” (READ: What is coronavirus? New disease spreading in Asia revives SARS fears) SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome is a potentially deadly illness that spread in 2003 and killed over 800 in China and Hong Kong. It started in China and quickly spread in Asia, even reaching Europe and North America. It was transmitted through coughing and sneezing. In the Philippines, SARS claimed two deaths in 2003 – a Filipino nursing assistant visiting from Canada and her father, whom she had infected. SARS may start out like flu. Initial symptoms of the disease are: fever over 38 °C, chills, muscle aches and soreness. After 2 to 7 days, infected people develop dry cough, which affects oxygen intake. SARS can then lead to pneumonia, heart failure, and liver failure, especially if infected people have existing illnesses like diabetes and hepatitis. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier in January ordered the health department’s Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) to strengthen its surveillance of incoming travelers from China after initial reports of the disease in Wuhan. Duque said the BOQ will be on high alert, especially with travelers manifesting fever or signs of respiratory infection. He also urged the public, especially those who have recently traveled from China, to seek immediate medical consult if they have been experiencing flu-like symptoms. The BOQ will with airlines on Wednesday, January 22, to remind them of measures to observe in light of the virus. The BOQ said it would ensure that airlines have universal protective kits on board and remind them of protocols in handling cases on board and reporting cases to authorities. – Rappler.com ","['health', 'said', 'sars', 'duque', 'coronavirus', 'chinese', 'case', 'january', 'fever', 'china', 'wuhan', 'disease', 'symptoms', 'like', 'cases', '3', 'novel', 'cov', 'people', 'francisco', 'iii', '2019', 'reported', 'secretary', 'cough', 'travelers', 'respiratory', 'city', 'boq', '  ']",['3 Chinese'],[],suspected,3,Chinese,

The DOH is investigating the case of a 5-year-old child who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China for manifesting fever, throat irritation and cough prior to entering the country. Photo by KD Madrilejos/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said much is still unknown regarding the novel coronavirus or 2019 nCoV, allaying fears that the new virus that has caused illness in China is certainly as threatening as the viruses that caused SARS and MERS epidemics years ago. The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday, January 21, announced that it was investigating a case of “non-specific pancoronavirus” found in a 5-year-old child who traveled from Wuhan, China – the center of the outbreak – to Cebu City. This means that the child could be afflicted with the 2019 nCoV or any of the 4 other existing coronaviruses that can infect humans. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) Coronaviruses are known to cause a wide range of conditions from the common cold to the more severe SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle Easy respiratory syndrome). Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, January 22, Duque said there are “still many blindspots on the novel coronavirus” and that the DOH is in constant communication with the World Health Organization (WHO) for definitive updates regarding the virus. Duque said being infected with a coronavirus is not “an automatic death sentence” as there are coronaviruses that cause the common cold. He added that the 5-year-old child in Cebu City is recovering, still with coughs but no longer feverish. But he added that the DOH is waiting for test results from the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia before it can rule out that the coronavirus found in the child is 2019 nCoV. They expect results to come out Thursday, January 23. The Chinese government on Wednesday warned that the disease may spread as the death toll hit 9 and the number of cases reached 440 across China. Cases have also been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Chinese officials have also said that the virus may be spread through human-to-human contact, though the WHO has yet to make a similar pronouncement. “Generally, coronaviruses spread via aerial droplets…through sneezing and coughing. That’s why personal hygiene, cough etiquette are very important, they will certainly reduce the chances of transmission,” Duque said. He also said illnesses caused by coronaviruses are “self-limiting” and that recovery may be quick given effective supportive treatment. The key is to strengthen the immune system, Duque said. The WHO will convene an emergency committee on Wednesday to discuss the novel virus to determine whether the recent outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. The committee is also expected to come up with recommendations for management of the disease. – Rappler.com ","['said', 'duque', 'coronavirus', 'coronaviruses', 'child', 'novel', 'health', 'doh', 'ncov', 'china', '2019', 'virus', '5-year', 'cold', 'wednesday', 'cause', 'old', 'common', 'spread', 'january', 'caused', 'death', 'infected', 'results', 'city', 'sars', 'sentence', 'disease', 'emergency', 'found']",[],[],suspected,0,,

This, according to Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon, Jr., was the 4th patient assessed by attending doctors for novel coronavirus infection. The flight attendant from Cavite province consulted a private physician in Kalibo a day after the patient manifested flu-like symptoms. ""The walk-in patient has history of travel from Wuhan, China. She was referred  to Aklan provincial hospital by the private physician for self-quarantine, for admission and under observation by doctors.

A 29-year old female Chinese tourist was brought to the Aklan provincial hospital after experiencing flu-like symptoms on arrival at Kalibo International Airport from Nanjing, China at around 9:30 pm on January 17. ""The victim did not manifest any fever and no difficulty of breathing the following day. She was discharged by attending physicians at around 1:30 pm after sample specimen was collected from her,"" Cuachon said. Last January 18, a three-year old girl from China was also taken to the Aklan provincial hospital for manifesting symptoms like cough, colds, and fever. A 65-year old Chinese man who arrived in Kalibo with cough and colds on January 20 was also brought to Aklan hospital. On the same day, they were treated as outpatients after their examinations. Cuachon said the blood and other specimen samples of patients were transported to the Department of Health (DOH) regional office in Iloilo City for confirmatory tests with the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine  (RITM) in Metro Manila. ""All 3 Chinese nationals have no recent history of travel from Wuhan. After their trip from Boracay, they are advised to secure medical clearance from DRSTMH. If the results from RITM yield positive, we conduct intensive contact tracing activities to control the risk of transmission of coronaviruses,"" he added. Cuachon also reminded the public to observe proper cough etiquette, wear protective masks, avoid sick people and practice frequent handwashing. Meanwhile, Kalibo airport  quarantine officers are using handheld thermal scanners to check the body temperature of incoming international travellers with direct regional flights from China, Korea, and Taiwan. Airports in Aklan are also on heightened surveillance status against the novel coronavirus.

250029,2020-01-23,Philippines,DOH says it's ready in case new coronavirus reaches PH,Janella Paris,"'We need to think it’s coming so we can be prepared,' says Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo  PREPARED. Chinese nationals arriving from Guangzhou, China are seen wearing face mask at the arrival area of Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 1 in Pasay City. Photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) assured the public that systems are in place in case the new coronavirus that has spread in China reaches the Philippines. DOH Undersecretary Eric Domingo told reporters on Thursday, January 23, that the health department is “fully prepared” and that protocols are in place if ever cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV are reported in the country. “It’s just a matter of activating the infrastructure we have ready,” Domingo said. (READ: ‘Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The health department is currently probing the case of a 5-year-old Chinese boy in Cebu City who tested positive for what the DOH called “non-specific pancoronavirus.” This means that he tested negative for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but may have been infected by any of the 4 mild coronaviruses known to infect humans or the new coronavirus that emerged in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019. The DOH is waiting for test results from an Australian laboratory to determine whether the boy indeed has 2019-nCoV. If he tests negative, he may be discharged from the hospital in Cebu, where he has been under observation since January 12. “The World Health Organization’s (WHO) position right now is that the virus is really going to spread. In fact, it has already gone to several countries; the international spread is no longer theoretical. ” Domingo said. If a case is confirmed and if the WHO declares the new virus an international public health emergency, Domingo said the DOH will proceed with guidelines it followed during the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) outbreaks in 2003 and 2014, respectively, but “with modifications” attentive to the new virus. This means other government agencies, including the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Bureau of Immigration, the Department of National Defense, among others, will be involved. More resources will also be directed to guarding airports and seaports and other points of entry into the country. Currently, the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) is on high alert, screening passengers of flights from China for symptoms like coughs, colds, sneezing, and difficulty breathing. South China Morning Post reported that 4 family members of a 39-year-old man found to be “preliminarily positive” with the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV traveled from Hong Kong to Manila Wednesday, January 23, via a Cebu Pacific flight. According to the airline, all passengers were screened by the BOQ upon arrival and none was held for further observation, which means no passenger exhibited symptoms of respiratory illness. Domingo reminded the public that persons would only be put under observation if they have a history of travel to Wuhan or of working at a hospital there, if they’ve had contact with anyone suspected of the virus, and if they show symptoms of respiratory illness. Health cards are also being issued to travelers from China. Domingo said they also plan to distribute flyers so travelers may know how to contact the DOH in case they start manifesting symptoms. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said that there were still “many blindspots” concerning the new virus, allaying fears that 2019-nCoV, which has caused 17 deaths in Wuhan, is certainly as threatening as the viruses that caused SARS and MERS epidemics years ago. Scientists have yet to identify the source of the 2019-nCoV, but there are reasonable suspicions that it may have come from a public seafood market in Wuhan that has been found to be selling wild animals. Health officials in China have also said the virus may be transmitted from person-to-person. As of Wednesday, January 22, there have been 555 cases reported in Asia and North America, with 444 of the cases all in Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease. Wuhan, with a population of 11 million, has been on lockdown as authorities scramble to control the spread of the disease. Flights from Wuhan have also been canceled since Thursday as ports of entry around the world ramped up their response to the threat. WHO is set to convene a council meeting on Thursday that would determine whether the current situation is an international public health emergency and would outline the steps for preparedness and response against the disease. – Rappler.com ","['health', 'wuhan', 'china', 'domingo', 'said', 'department', 'doh', 'virus', 'coronavirus', 'public', '2019-ncov', 'new', 'international', 'disease', 'january', 'spread', 'symptoms', 'respiratory', 'case', '2019', 'novel', 'city', 'cebu', 'caused', 'means', 'reported', 'prepared', 'sars', 'thursday', 'mers']",['555 cases'],['cebu'],suspected,555,cases,cebu
250097,2020-01-24,Philippines,Lacson questions ending VFA to get Dela Rosa's visa back,Aika Rey,"(UPDATED) Senator Panfilo Lacson says the Supreme Court needs to 'act soonest' on whether a two-third vote by the Senate is needed to terminate international treaties  PH-US WAR GAMES. This file photo shows US soldiers and their Filipino counterparts joining forces in an Amphibious Landing operation as part of the 2015 Balikatan Exercises. File photo by Ben Nabong/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Senator Panfilo Lacson questioned President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to end the Philippines' Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) following the cancellation of the US visa of Senator Ronald ""Bato"" dela Rosa. ""Where is the connection?"" Lacson asked on Friday, January 24, saying that bargaining VFA with Dela Rosa's visa are two different things. ""The Visiting Forces Agreement between the Philippines and United States is a BILATERAL accord that went through some back-and-forth diplomatic discussions prior to ratification by the Senate, after some intense plenary deliberation,"" Lacson said. ""On the other hand, the US visa is a conditional authorization UNILATERALLY given to a visiting foreigner which may be granted, canceled or even denied outright, without need for explanation or justification,"" he added. Lacson, whose US visa was also canceled, said he didn't make an issue out of it. His visa was revoked after the 2000 case where he got classified information from then-White House security specialist Leandro Aragoncillo. ""I never make an issue out of it for the same reason that I am saying now – it is the US government’s right, as it was only my privilege to be granted the same,"" he said. In another tweet, Lacson also cited the significant help that the Philippines had been receiving from the US under the VFA. ""International terrorist Zulkifli Abdhir Marwan was neutralized with the technical assistance extended by the US. The VFA has provided our AFP the military training and equipment, thus upgrading their capability. That and more may be missed,"" he said. Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Sabaya was also neutralized in June 2002, also with the help of US tecnical assistance. Dela Rosa, meanwhile, said that the President's bargain is ""not all about him."" ""He is a leader who doesn’t want his people treated unfairly. I don't deserve this bargain, but it's not all about me. It is about a one-sided foreign relations,"" said Dela Rosa, who has a lot to lose with the visa cancelation as he has relatives in the US. Issue on Senate concurrence Several lawmakers had raised the issue of treaties that may easily be revoked by the President as he wished, because of the lack of safeguards such as Senate concurrence. ""While Senate ratification was needed to make the VFA valid – which the Senate did during presidency [of Joseph Estrada] – it can now be terminated without concurrence of the Senate,"" Drilon said. During the 17th Congress, at least 14 senators had filed a resolution declaring that the Senate has a say in the termination of any treaty or international agreements. The resolution was filed in 2016 after Duterte had declared intentions to scrap the VFA and withdraw from the International Criminal Court. The same justification led to the actual withdrawal of the Philippines from the ICC. The Supreme Court has yet to issue a decision on the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC, which may set the guidelines on terminating international agreements. ""In the absence of a Philippine Supreme Court ruling on the President’s power to unilaterally break a treaty or bilateral agreement like the VFA without the consent of a 2/3 supermajority vote of the members of the Senate, the President can do that without the Senate’s approval or consent,""  Lacson said. ""The Supreme Court should act soonest on whether the Senate’s consent is needed before the executive department can terminate a treaty or bilateral agreement – an issue raised in a petition filed before it by members of the Senate,"" Lacson added. Foreign interference? Senator Francis Pangilinan said that ending the VFA is in line of Duterte's pivot to China. ""Pabor sa China ang pagterminate ng VFA, kaya hindi na katakataka ito. (The termination of the VFA is in favor of China, so this is not surprising),"" Pangilinan said. The senator also added that the President should have focused on other things such as the welfare of the residents affected by the Taal Volcano eruption and the threat of a new coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, Senator Aquilino Pimentel III said that he understood the decision of the President even if it sounds ""personal."" ""The reason stated by the president for terminating the PH-US VFA may sound ""personal"" but I see the point of the President. He believes Sen Bato is being punished by the US for having once been the implementor of his main program of government – the all-out war against drugs,"" Pimentel said. Pimentel added that such punishment reeks of foreign interference to domestic policy. ""Since that is domestic policy (war on drugs) then punishing someone – even if indirectly – for a domestic policy shows the intent to interfere by a foreign state with PH domestic policy,"" Pimentel said. The VFA, which took effect in 1999, outlined guidelines for the conduct of American troops visiting the Philippines and is the foundation for military exercises between the Philippines and the US, some of which the Duterte adminstration has already stopped. Duterte first threatened the abrogation of the VFA in 2016, when the  Millennium Challenge Corporation, a US aid-giving body, did not renew its grant to the Philippines over human rights concerns on the Philippines' war on drugs. – Rappler.com ","['vfa', 'said', 'senate', 'philippines', 'president', 'lacson', 'issue', 'senator', 'visa', 'court', 'duterte', 'international', 'war', 'pimentel', 'agreement', 'domestic', 'supreme', 'policy', 'rosa', 'added', 'dela', 'visiting', 'foreign', '  ', 'bilateral', 'concurrence', 'forces', 'drugs', 'decision', 'ph']",['2000 case'],[],,2000,case,

The DOH on Friday, January 24, said laboratory tests from the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Australia showed that the 5-year-old boy did not have 2019-nCoV, the virus that originated from Wuhan, China, and has so far killed 25 and sickened over 800 across the country and other states in Asia and North America. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The child, who had traveled to Cebu with his mother to study English, had been isolated in a hospital since January 12. He had initially manifested ""pneumonia-like symptoms"" like fever, coughs, colds, and chills but is currently no longer feverish, according to the DOH. The Philippines' Research Institute for Tropical Medicine had already ruled out the coronaviruses that cause SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) before sending the child's laboratory samples to the Australian institute. They will have to run another test to rule out pancoronavirus before the child may be discharged from the hospital, the DOH said. The DOH remains on high alert as the death toll in China due to the virus rose on Friday. The health department said its Bureau of Quarantine is working closely with airlines and airport authorities to ensure stricter border surveillance. The health department's emergency response has also been activated; the DOH is to coordinate with other agencies like the Department of the Interior and Local Government and its regional counterparts to cascade information regarding the virus and strengthen community engagement. The DOH is also calling on those with a history of travel to Wuhan, China, who are experiencing symptoms like fever and cough to immediately seek medical consult. Health facilities are equipped and health workers are on full alert, the DOH assured the public. Reports of the 2019-nCoV have revived fears of an outbreak akin to the SARS scare of 2003, which claimed over 800 lives in China and Hong Kong.

Photo from Bureau of Customs MANILA, Philippines – The Bureau of Customs (BOC) on Saturday, January 25, ordered the destruction of pork products imported from China that tested positive for African swine fever (ASF). The BOC said that a shipment of Peking ducks and several misdeclared items consigned to Dynamic M Int’l Trading Inc. arrived December 11, 2019. Upon examination of the shipments contents on Wednesday, January 22, the products were found to be contaminated by ASF, a highly contagious viral disease that affected pigs, warthogs, and boars. Though humans cannot get sick from the virus, humans can become carriers. (READ: FAST FACTS: What is African swine fever?) All of the container’s contents were to be destroyed and buried at the importer’s warehouse compound after disposal plans were finalized, the BOC said in a statement. BOC said in a Saturday statement that an alert order has been issued for other shipments consigned to the same company, whose warehouse is in Kawit, Cavite. The BOC added that a case will be filed against the company and that its brokers’ licenses will be recommended for revocation. “Given the circumstances (Wuhan coronavirus) we have today, every entry point in the country must be on its toes to stop any viruses or bacteria from getting to our shores. Our mandate is to protect our people and that’s what we intend to do,” BOC Commissioner Rey Leonardo Guerrero said. “This is a message to all importers. We are not going to tolerate misdeclared goods or the importation of food products that will put our industries in jeopardy. Our ports are not open for more of these products,” Guerrero also said. The BOC has been closely monitoring Manila ports for meat and seafood products. In December, over 130 cargoes of frozen seafood products were seized by the BOC after consignees failed to secure proper importation permits. Global meat production has declined after an outbreak of ASF in many parts of the world. In October last year, at least 13 provinces in the Philippines declared an ASF outbreak, prompting local governments to prohibit the selling of pork in markets and restaurants. – Rappler.com ","['boc', 'products', 'said', 'customs', 'asf', 'swine', 'fever', 'contents', 'bureau', 'african', 'warehouse', 'manila', 'seafood', 'philippines', 'importer', 'seized', 'finalized', 'ports', 'company', 'compound', 'found', 'pork', 'destroyed', 'guerrero', 'plans', 'disposal', 'december', 'misdeclared', 'shipments', 'humans']",[],[],,0,,

The 58-year-old Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour on Siglap Hill, Singapore, was standing room only. It was the Fiesta Mass in honor of Santo Niño de Cebu, the Child Jesus symbolized by the Philippines' oldest religious image that Spanish colonizers gave Cebu in the 1500s. It was the 6th time that the Filipino community in Singapore was celebrating the Sinulog, but this year was different because Singapore is on alert. In Singapore, there have been at least 4 cases of the novel coronavirus, also known as the Wuhan virus, named after its reported place of origin in China. (READ: The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?) Safety from the Wuhan virus was one of the prayers by Santo Niño devotees in Singapore on Sunday. With some of them wearing surgical masks, devotees joined not only the Mass but also the Sinulog procession afterwards. ""Since there's the coronavirus, hopefully no Filipino is affected by this disease,"" said Janice Papa, a Filipino who has been working in Singapore for almost 11 years. Papa, who has attended Sinulog celebrations in Singapore since 6 years ago, also prayed that Taal Volcano would not erupt again, and that she might have good health. One of the event's organizers, Eric Naguiat, also prayed that the Wuhan virus ""will be prevented soon,"" and that victims ""be given God's grace for their fast healing."" The Philippine embassy in Singapore has advised Filipinos not to touch live animals or consume raw, undercooked food; avoid crowded places; observe proper hygiene; always wash their hands with soap; wear a mask if they have cough or shortness of breath; and seek doctors' help if they feel unwell. The local Catholic Church itself implemented its own precautionary measures, with the Archdiocese of Singapore indefinitely suspending the practice of communion by the mouth. The Wuhan virus, however, did not stop the Sinulog in Singapore from demonstrating the vibrant faith of Filipinos anywhere in the world. Still it showed how Filipinos, from merely receiving the Gospel from Spaniards almost 500 years ago, are now the ones spreading Catholicism worldwide – in the words of Pope Francis late last year, ""smugglers of the faith."" ""In the 500 years of our faith, we Filipinos have spread and proclaimed the faith to other places where we Filipinos live,"" said Father Charlie Oasan, chaplain of Filipinos in Singapore, in an interview with Rappler.

Philippine quarantine personnel monitor passengers arriving from international flights at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on January 23, 2020, amid the novel coronavirus scare Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Bureau of Immigration announced on Tuesday, January 28, that it will ""temporarily suspend"" the visa upon arrival (VUA) mechanism for Chinese tourists and businessmen due to the novel coronavirus scare. “We are now temporarily suspending the issuance of VUA for Chinese nationals to slow down the influx of group tours,” Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente said in a statement on Tuesday. Morente cited the move of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to suspend direct flights from Wuhan City, the epicenter of the virus. Philippine health authorities had not yet confirmed a case of novel coronavirus in the country but as of Tuesday, 3 people were being monitored for flu-like symptoms at the San Lazaro hospital in Manila. Two of the 3 patients have a history of travel to Wuhan. Morente clarified there is no policy to bar Chinese nationals in general, so those who have other valid visas can still enter the Philippines. “We have not received any directive imposing policy changes on Chinese nationals. But we are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCov,” Morente said. The VUA is open to Chinese visitors who are part of accredited tour groups, delegates of conferences, investors and businessmen with endorsements from the Philippines, and athletes. The Department of Justice (DOJ) tightened rules on VUA this month, limiting it to 30 days only with no provision for extension. Cruise ships Immigration officers have also put in place protocols for inspection of tour cruise ships docking at the country. According to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), the “World Dream Cruise Ship” from Hong Kong arrived at the Philippines Tuesday morning, while the cargo ship “MV Ligulao” from Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China arrived Monday, January 27. Jiangsu is 900 kilometers away from Wuhan. The PCG said both vessels were declared safe by the Bureau of Quarantine. ""As to our officers who board these vessels for immigration inspection, health and sanitation protocols have already been put in place to minimize, if not altogether ensure against, the health hazards related to their work,"" said Justice Undersecretary for Immigration Markk Perete. – Rappler.com ","['immigration', 'chinese', 'morente', 'philippines', 'tuesday', 'philippine', 'coronavirus', 'said', 'vua', 'nationals', 'january', 'cruise', 'novel', 'health', 'scare', 'wuhan', 'policy', 'protocols', 'visas', 'place', 'temporarily', 'ships', 'inspection', 'businessmen', 'tour', '3', 'flights', 'general', 'international', 'slow']",[],[],,0,,

250395,2020-01-28,Philippines,"2 ships from China arrive in Manila, get coronavirus clearance",JC Gotinga,"(UPDATED) The Bureau of Quarantine concludes the ships' passengers and crew are free of the novel coronavirus, shortly after the vessels docked at the Port of Manila  CRUISE SHIP. The 'World Dream' cruise ship arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on January 28, 2020. The Bureau of Quarantine declared its passengers free of the novel coronavirus. Photo from the Philippine Coast Guard MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Two ships from China docked at Pier 15 of the Port of Manila were declared ""clear and safe"" from the novel coronavirus by the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ), the Philippine Coast Guard said on Tuesday, January 28. The World Dream cruise ship arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on Tuesday. Its 778 passengers were ""authorized to travel"" by the BOQ. They were originally scheduled to board the ship again on Tuesday night to travel to Subic Bay for a tour on Wednesday, January 29. However, Olongapo City Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr and Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun both asked the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to stop admitting cruise ships because of the threat of the novel coronavirus. In Olongapo City, which faces Subic Bay, groups rallied to protest the arrival of cruise ships, worried it would put them at risk of exposure to the virus. Coast guard spokesperson Captain Armand Balilo said the World Dream's Subic tour has been canceled, and the cruise ship will sail back to Hong Kong on Wednesday. The other vessel, the cargo ship MV Ligulao, arrived in Manila from Lianyungang, Jiangsu, in mainland China on Monday, January 27. Although the BOQ declared the ship's 20 crew members free of the novel coronavirus, they were not allowed to disembark because they had no shore passes. The MV Ligulao is expected to leave Manila on Tuesday afternoon. Officials from the BOQ ran ""mandatory inspections"" of both vessels' crew and passengers, the coast guard said. When asked how the BOQ concluded that the people aboard the ship were free of the virus given that its carriers may not show any symptoms, the coast guard did not give an immediate answer. The coast guard works with the BOQ and the Bureau of Immigration (BI) in inspecting vessels coming into the Port of Manila. Immigration officers routinely board cruise ships bound for the Philippines at a foreign port, and then conduct inspections onboard while at sea, said Undersecretary Markk Perete of the Department of Justice (DOJ), which oversees the BI. ""We have directed the BI to coordinate with the Department of Health on the proper protocols – the use of masks and other protective clothing or gear, the procedure on face to face checks, et cetera. All these safety measures have been designed in coordination with, and taking into consideration, the inputs from our health officials,"" Perete said in a media interview on Tuesday. Although the DOJ temporarily suspended granting visas upon arrival to Chinese nationals starting Tuesday to ""slow down the influx of group tours,"" the order did not cover the passengers of the World Dream cruise ship because cruise passengers secure visas before arriving in the Philippines, BI Spokesperson Dana Mengote Sandoval told Rappler. The novel coronavirus is believed to have originated from Wuhan, China. At least 106 people have died in the epidemic that has spread throughout China, and reached several other countries around the world. Travel to and from Wuhan has been blocked, and travel in and around China has been restricted. Although the Philippines suspended flights to and from Wuhan, it has not extended the measure to cover China entirely. Philippine health officials are monitoring a number of patients with flu-like symptoms, including two at Manila's San Lazaro Hospital who have a history of travel to Wuhan. There is no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in the Philippines as of this posting. – Rappler.com ","['ship', 'manila', 'cruise', 'novel', 'coronavirus', 'china', 'boq', 'tuesday', 'guard', 'passengers', 'coast', 'ships', 'travel', 'world', 'subic', 'philippines', 'said', 'port', 'dream', 'free', 'wuhan', 'bureau', 'january', 'bi', 'hong', 'officials', 'crew', 'kong', 'philippine', 'declared']",[],[],,0,,

The latest figure, given during  DOH press briefing on Tuesday, is up from the 11 reported on Monday, January 27. The DOH initially had a total of 27 persons under investigation (PUIs), but 3 of them, including the 5-year-old boy in Cebu who was the first case to be monitored, had been discharged from the hospital after they were found to have the regular flu. The 24 cases were found in the following regions: The DOH said the persons under investigation are all foreign visitors. The health department also cautioned the public against believing random messages circulating online and through text about supposed cases of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines. The DOH and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Philippines reiterated that there are so far no confirmed cases of the new virus here, and that the people under investigation are isolated in the respective hospitals where they had been  admitted. The DOH on Tuesday, January 28, activated the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases in light of the emerging public health thread. This means response to the possible spread of the virus will involve not just the DOH but also the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Labor and Employment, Civil Aeronautics Board, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, and Philippine Overseas Employment Administration.

This decision comes after a meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases on Tuesday, January 28, that discussed the Philippine government’s measures to contain the current 2019-nCoV threat. As of posting, the virus has sickened 4,515 people and killed 106. All the deaths have so far been in China – 105 in Wuhan and 1 in Beijing. While cases are concentrated in China, the virus has spread to neighboring Asian countries, as well as, Europe, North America, and Australia. (READ: ’Novel coronavirus’ or 2019 nCoV: What we know so far) The city of Wuhan is currently on lockdown, but foreign nationals may be repatriated if their home countries order so, according to DFA Undersecretary Brigido Dulay, who was at the inter-agency task force meeting. The task force was led by the DOH, with the DFA, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Department of Labor and Employment, Civil Aeronautics Board, Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, and Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. “We have to work with Chinese authorities. Right now it’s hard to put a finger on how fast we can do it (repatriate Filipinos), but we hope to do it as quickly as possible,” Dulay said, adding that the repatriation may either be by air or by land. The task force is also discouraging “non-essential travel to China” while Chinese authorities scramble to contain the outbreak. It added that Filipinos who wish to stay in China should heed advisories from local health authorities and cooperate with efforts to quell the further spread of 2019-nCoV there. The DOH also advised overseas Filipinos in affected areas to avoid crowded places, use mask and gloves, and practice proper hygiene in order to reduce exposure to and transmission of said virus. Filipinos who are repatriated from Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province will be put on quarantine for 14 days, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. Duque added that the Philippine government was in constant communication with Chinese counterparts through the DFA. “We just have to make sure that we are to monitor the further developments,” he said. As of posting, there are no confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV in the Philippines, but the DOH revealed that it is probing 24 foreign nationals who have shown symptoms of respiratory illness and have had histories of travel to Wuhan, China. The Bureau of Immigration has also “temporarily suspended” the visa upon arrival (VUA) procedure for Chinese tourists and businessmen due to the scare. But there is no policy barring Chinese nationals in general, so those who have other valid visas can still enter the Philippines. Asked whether the Philippines should bar from entering anyone flying in from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, World Health Organization (WHO) Philippine country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said: “There is no justification for this. Certainly if there is evidence of clear, extensive transmission at a community level, that could be considered."" Abeyasinghe added that the primary measure at the moment is to monitor those showing symptoms, as well as those with history of travel to Wuhan. — Rappler.com ","['china', 'health', 'wuhan', '2019-ncov', 'filipinos', 'department', 'chinese', 'said', 'force', 'monitor', 'authorities', 'doh', 'task', 'philippines', 'philippine', 'dfa', 'travel', 'local', 'repatriation', 'coronavirus', 'foreign', 'novel', 'countries', 'cases', 'nationals', 'spread', 'overseas', 'measures', 'government', 'virus']",[],[],,0,,

250440,2020-01-28,Philippines,This is why a cruise ship from China couldn't dock in Subic,Randy V. Datu,"Local officials and people's organizations put the pressure on the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to temporarily stop accepting cruise ships amid the novel coronavirus scare  PROTEST. Residents and local leaders ask the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority to temporarily ban the arrival of cruise ships in Subic. All photos from Randy Datu/Rappler ZAMBALES, Philippines – The Subic tour of cruise ship MV World Dream was canceled due to intense pressure from residents and local leaders for the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA) to temporarily stop accepting cruise ships amid the novel coronavirus scare. The cruise ship from China arrived in Manila on Tuesday, January 28, and its 778 passengers were ""authorized to travel"" by the Bureau of Quarantine. Scheduled to arrive in Subic on Wednesday, January 29, the ship instead decided to cancel its arrival and head back to Hong Kong. In a January 28 letter, Olongapo Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr urged SBMA Chairman and Administrator Wilma Eisma to ""temporarily stop accepting cruise ships until the (novel coronavirus) threat has been controlled."" He cited the ""uncertainty and lack of information"" on the novel coronavirus, the virus that originated from Wuhan, China, and has so far killed at least 106 and sickened thousands across China and several other countries. Paulino also noted that ""infected persons do not manifest any of its symptoms until much later."" He said temporarily stopping cruise ships from docking in Subic ""would not be unprecedented considering that various cities worldwide have implemented lockdowns in response to this disease."" 'Loss of income' The night before, Eisma issued a statement that said, ""I have personally discussed the Subic situation with Health Secretary Francisco Duque today and confirmed to him that safety protocols are in place at the Port of Subic."" ""He advised that there is not a need just yet to stop the entry of cruise ships in Subic in view of established safety measures in the Freeport,"" she added. The SBMA initially highlighted the supposed loss of income that could occur if the arrival of cruise ships was rejected, but this only angered residents even more. ""As an emerging cruise ship destination in Southeast Asia, Subic expects to be adversely affected by this ongoing health emergency,"" Eisma earlier said. Eisma was also in the habit of asking SBMA employees to physically welcome passengers of cruise ships at the dock upon their arrival, but none were willing this time. A rumor even circulated that SBMA tourism employees would not report for work if the cruise ship was allowed to dock. On Tuesday, as the uproar from residents and Subic workers grew, Paulino pleaded with Eisma to ""please err on the side of caution and put primacy in the health and safety of the residents and workers of SBFZ (Subic Bay Freeport Zone) and the city and municipalities surrounding it."" Subic Mayor Jonathan John Khonghun also sent a letter to Eisma, saying ""let us join hands to be more cautious, giving priority to the health and safety of the people in our locality.""  'ERR ON SIDE OF CAUTION.' Olongapo City Mayor Rolen Paulino Jr joins the rally. Photo from Randy Datu/Rappler Backlash It was also reported that tourism establishments in the Subic Freeport were pushing behind the scenes and working with the Subic Bay Freeport Chamber of Commerce to temporarily suspend the arrival of cruise ships. Robert Gonzaga, president and CEO of Subic Bay Marine Exploratorium Inc (SBMEI), said in a statement: ""The SBMA has issued guidelines on how to deal with this, but they should do more to address the core issue of a temporary ban on cruise ship visits. For our part, we will refuse access to our park to cruise ship visitors if they do not comply with SBMA guidelines, and our [government's] health and safety policies."" SBMEI is the corporate owner and operator of Ocean Adventure, Adventure Beach Waterpark, and Camayan Beach Resort and Hotel – top attractions in the Freeport. Gonzaga said that more important considerations should be prioritized over short-term income. ""We have put in place several measures to protect our guests, as well as our employees, from any health risk associated with the coronavirus. We want to reassure the public that safety comes first, last, and always for SBMEI,"" he added. The backlash to Eisma's stance on the issue culminated in a rally in front of the main gate of the Subic Freeport, where about 200 residents and Freeport workers brandished signs that read: ""No to cruise ships in the meantime,"" ""Konting malasakit naman SBMA,"" and ""Mas mahalaga ba ang kita kesa sa kaligtasan ng mamamayan ng Olongapo?"" While the rally was ongoing, cheers went up as news broke that the MV World Dream has decided to cancel its visit to Subic. For her part, Eisma immediately took to Facebook and posted a statement saying, in part, that the cruise visit ""has been canceled by Genting Cruise Lines, the operator of the cruise liner, in face of the circumstances on the ground."" She said that the Subic Bay Freeport community can ""breathe a sigh of relief in the outcome that, we hope, is acceptable and satisfactory to all."" Despite this announcement, however, the SBMA is still silent on whether or not a temporary ban on cruise ships is already in place in the Subic Bay Freeport. Among the groups that exerted pressure on the SBMA were Batang Gapo People's Organization Incorporated, Olongapo City local government units, Aeta leaders, all 17 barangay captains, and other people's organizations. ""Why would we put ourselves in harm's way if we can prevent it? If in their own country, they have already implemented a lockdown, why can't we do the same here?""

Four of them were in close contact with an infected coronavirus patient in Hong Kong, Provincial Health Officer I Dr. Cornelio Cuachon Jr said on Tuesday, January 28. The 11 Chinese nationals from Hubei province were supposed to spend a one-month vacation in Boracay when Hong Kong authorities alerted the Philippine health officials to conduct intensive contact-tracing. Hubei has been on lockdown, limiting the movements of some 60 million people, since the new coronavirus broke out in its capital city of Wuhan last December. The tourists traveled from Hong Kong to Kalibo via Manila on January 22. Seven other Chinese people were traced by health authorities in close contacts with the 4 Chinese tourists in Boracay Island. It was not immediately known if the 4 Chinese who were in close contact with a confirmed case in Hong Kong were the family who landed in Manila on January 22 via Cebu Pacific, and which the Bureau of Immigration was supposed to have already tracked. The patients were transported to Kalibo town on Friday evening, January 24, for medical observation. They are staying in hotel rooms at the government-run Governor Corazon L.

They are made to stay at the training center because they might be at risk of hospital acquired-pneumonia if we admitted them. The 4 Chinese tourists had close contacts with one confirmed coronavirus patient in Hong Kong. The 7 other Chinese who are with these 4 in Boracay are also under medical observation,"" Cuachon said in a mix of English and Filipino. “We are monitoring them every day. After the 14-day incubation period, they will be allowed to go back to China, with the help of the Chinese embassy, and will have to cut short their vacation in Boracay,” Cuachon added. 3 earlier patients discharged Meanwhile, the 3 patients were discharged from isolation rooms at the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) in Kalibo were discharged by attending doctors on January 28. A 6-year-old boy initially admitted in the Dr. Ciriaco H. Tirol Hospital in Boracay Island was referred to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 23 for exhibiting flu-like symptoms. Cuachon said the child, who had a history of travel to Wuhan in Hubei province, yielded negative results on coronavirus infection, based on tests conducted by the Philippines Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). “He had influenza, not novel coronavirus,” Cuachon said. Sample specimens were also taken from two female siblings, aged 8 and 6, from Shanghai, China, who had been admitted to the Aklan provincial hospital on January 26. These were sent to RITM for confirmatory tests. In efforts to keep coronavirus from spreading, PHO-Aklan is coordinating with the Department of Health and the Bureau of Quarantine in monitoring the arrival of passengers in ports and airports in the province. Cuachon urged the public to avoid contact with farm and wild animals, going to crowded places, and contact with sick individuals. On Saturday, January 25, Aklan health authorities sent back to Wuhan 80 Boracay-bound tourists. They were part of the group which left the epicenter city a few hours before it was locked down by Chinese authorities. Since December 2019, the Wuhan coronavirus has been reported in China, France, Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, Nepal, Germany, Japan, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, United States, and Sri Lanka. The World Health Organization said the common symptoms of novel coronavirus include cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, and fever. – Rappler.com   ","['health', 'aklan', 'chinese', 'coronavirus', 'boracay', 'january', 'hong', 'kong', 'cuachon', 'contact', 'provincial', 'province', 'close', 'authorities', 'tourists', 'hospital', 'said', 'kalibo', '4', 'bureau', 'confirmed', 'monitoring', 'wuhan', 'island', 'symptoms', 'boy', 'passengers', 'manila', 'quarantine', 'observation']",['11 Chinese'],['aklan'],suspected,11,Chinese,aklan

While the BI takes care of VUA issuances in the Philippines, the Department of Foreign Affairs takes care of the issuance of Philippine visas in foreign countries. The BI had also earlier clarified that there is no policy to bar Chinese nationals in general, so those who have other valid visas can still enter the Philippines.

But as of January 28, the health department announced that it was monitoring 24 people with symptoms of respiratory illness, and who all have a history of travel to Wuhan. Other measures taken: The DFA said it was ready to repatriate Filipinos in Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei province who want to come home, though this would be subject to China’s rules on disease containment, immigration clearance, and quarantine process. Upon arrival in the Philippines, the DFA said Filipino repatriates will undergo 14 days of mandatory quarantine per guidelines of the Department of Health. DFA Assistant Secretary Eduardo Meñez said about 50 Filipinos expressed the desire to come home as of Wednesday, January 29, but that details were still being ""coordinated and considered.""

DOH Secretary Francisco Duque lll at a press conference on the update of the coronavirus at the Philippine Blood Center in Quezon City on Wednesday, January 29, 2020. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed that the Department of Health (DOH) now has the capability to test samples for the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV, no longer needing to send them to Australia for confirmation. The primer needed to identify if suspected cases are positive for 2019 nCoV have been acquired from Japan, Duque said during a question hour before the House of Representatives on Wednesday, January 29. (WATCH: House question hour with health chief Duque on novel coronavirus) The primer will allow the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), the health department’s research arm, to determine ""within 48 hours"" whether samples from persons under investigation are positive for 2019-nCoV, which has infected over 6,000 in China and beyond, and killed over 130 in China, most of them in the city of Wuhan. Initially, the RITM could only test samples for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the coronaviruses that caused outbreaks of SARS or severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS or Middle East respiratory syndrome. The DOH had been sending samples to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, prior to the acquisition of the 2019-nCoV primer. Duque said the 2019-nCoV primer would cut testing time “by 50%.” The Australian laboratory is currently processing 6 samples from the Philippines for 2019-nCoV, the results of which are expected either by Thursday, January 30, or Friday, January 31.

250506,2020-01-29,Philippines,"Even with coronavirus scare, no mainland Chinese travel ban for now – Duque",Mara Cepeda,"DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III argues it would be 'very tricky' if the Philippines singles out China from all other countries with confirmed cases of the new disease  NO BAN VS CHINESE YET. DOH Francisco Duque III says the Philippine government is still studying imposing a temporary travel ban against Chinese tourists. Photo by Darren Langit/Rappler MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government is not yet considering imposing a temporary travel ban on all tourists coming from mainland China amid the threat of the novel coronavirus or 2019-nCov. This was Health Secretary Francisco Duque III’s response on Wednesday, January 29, when asked by Deputy Speaker Loren Legarda during the House of Representatives’ question hour if they were considering a temporary ban on all Chinese tourists. “Certainly thats one of the possible options that we are looking at, but not at this very moment. The reason being, your honor, is we have to be very careful also of possible repercussions of doing this, in light of the fact that confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus are not limited to China,” Duque said. The Department of Health (DOH) chief argued it would be unfair if only Chinese tourists are barred from entering the Philippines, when cases of 2019-nCov have also been confirmed in other countries. “If we do this, then the concerned country – China in this case – might question why we’re not doing the same for all other countries that have reported cases of the new coronavirus. It’s very tricky… but we commit to take this into consideration,” Duque said. The Philippines has only temporarily stopped issuing visas to travelers from Hubei province in China, whose capital city of Wuhan is the origin of the novel coronavirus. As of Wednesday, China has a total of 5,974 confirmed cases of the 2019-nCov, which has killed at least 106 people there. Apart from China, other countries that have confirmed cases of 2019 nCov include France, Japan, Australia, United States, Canada, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and United Arab Emirates. More ‘prudent’ to temporarily ban Chinese Contrasting with the DOH chief, Legarda believes it would be more “prudent” for the Philippines to impose the temporary travel ban against mainlander Chinese. “We’re clearly incapable of handling [this] crisis. Wouldn’t it be prudent [for us] to be proactive and ban temporarily mainland tourists in any port, not only Wuhan?” asked the Antique congresswoman. “I just value too much the health of the Filipino people,” Legarda added. Senator Francis Pangilinan, who wants a temporary ban against Chinese tourists like Legarda, said a total of 1,626,309 mainlanders visited the Philippines from January to November 2019 alone. “The progressive spread of the coronavirus and the increasing number of deaths due to it should prompt Philippine health and immigration authorities to preemptively ban visitors from Wuhan, if not from the most affected provinces of China,” Pangilinan said in a separate statement. The Philippines still has no confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, though 23 persons with flu-like symptoms are still under observation by the DOH. – Rappler.com ","['ban', 'china', 'chinese', 'philippines', 'cases', 'tourists', 'confirmed', 'coronavirus', 'temporary', 'doh', 'duque', 'novel', 'legarda', 'health', 'said', 'countries', 'francisco', 'wuhan', '2019-ncov', 'prudent', 'philippine', 'iii', 'temporarily', 'travel', 'mainland', 'secretary', 'people', 'considering', 'new', 'january']","['5,974 confirmed']",[],,5974,confirmed,

Four of the 27, meanwhile, have already been discharged from the hospital and are in constant coordination with the DOH for updates on their condition.

Although there were no confirmed cases of 2019-nCov in Aklan or the rest of the Philippines, for that matter – the indefinite suspension of classes was in effect in schools near the Governor Corazon L. Cabagnot Tourism and Training Center or Aklan Training Center in Barangay Old Buswang, about two kilometers from downtown Kalibo. The suspension of classes affected some 4,000 students of Starglow Center for Academics and Arts, Buswang Old Bakhaw Sur Elementary School, and Saint Gabriel College, which are within the 500-meter radius of the government training center. Classes at the Regional Science High School for Region VI, a stone’s throw away from training center, were also canceled as a precautionary measure.

On Thursday, January 29, Kalibo Mayor Emerson Lachica issued Executive Order No. 004 calling for the class suspensions to safeguard the health and safety of students, employees, and teachers. He issued the EO after the Provincial Health Office announced it was monitoring 11 Chinese visitors – 7 adults and 4 children – who were traced by health authorities in Boracay Island last week. They were admitted to the Aklan provincial hospital in Kalibo, on January 24 and transferred to the training center the next day for medical observation.

This includes a temporary ban on all cruise ships from docking at any of our ports,"" Hontiveros said. Recto questioned why the Philippines has yet to implement a travel ban, saying that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, had already announced plans to slash cross-border travel. ""I think it is time to put a temporary 'Do not enter sign' on our doorstep for visitors from China. Let us explain to them that we are not permanently closing our doors. This is not a permanent Great Wall. This is only during the duration of the coronavirus crisis,"" Recto said.

Asked about the proposed travel ban involving China, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Wednesday, January 29, that it would be “very tricky” if the Philippines only imposes it on the neighboring giant, as other countries have recorded cases of the novel coronavirus as well.

Tourists enjoy the cold weather at Northern Blossom Flower Park in Atok Benguet. Photo by Mau Victa/Rappler BAGUIO CITY – Usually cold weather is most welcome here in Baguio. But when the temperature dipped to 11.2 degrees at 5 am Friday, January 31, it was met with more anxiety than excitement. It is the coldest temperature for Baguio this year. Last January 4, the temperature dipped to 11.4 degrees. In the higher reaches of Benguet, the cold reached 10 degrees, this does not even include the wind chill factor which can bring the cold down to 5 degrees. If the tailend of amihan or easterly winds is at its last blast, the weather might still get colder. Last year, it reached its coldest at 9.8 degrees on January 28. This may be good for the cold hunters. But with the first victim of coronavirus in the Philippines identified last Thursday, January 31, and persons under investigation reaching 53, the cold is actually bad news. Cold weather is known to serve as an ideal ground for viruses like the common cold and the flu. These viruses  have achieved the ability to spread between people, as they are more stable in cold air, and low humidity helps them to “float” for longer. Cold weather also decreases the bodily defenses, allowing viruses to enter the body with ease. But so far, Baguio is safe from the dreaded coronavirus. Department of Health-Cordillera (Kagawaran Ng Kalusugan - Cordillera) Infectious Disease Cluster Head Dr. Jennifer Joyce Pira said that there are no persons under investigation (PUI) with regards to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Pira said the DOH-CAR only monitored an individual who arrived from Guangzhou, China but has no history of travel to Wuhan, China and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV case. The person also has no known contact with individuals with severe acute respiratory illness or sick animals. She said that although the individual and two of his roommates are under quarantine, they are all doing well and show no signs of illnesses.

WHO Philippines was responding to our question about the impact of water scarcity, particularly in Cebu, on efforts to combat an outbreak of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.    The Department of Health also recommends frequent hand washing and “good hygiene” to combat the spread of the virus.

Multiple attempts to reach Labella to ask if water distribution or sanitizer supply plans were part of the discussion went unanswered. But he is scheduled to discuss the water crisis in a public forum at the Cebu City Sports Complex on Monday, February 3. More water sources to open In January alone, the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) announced 15 separate water interruptions for different barangays. MCWD spokesperson Charmaine Kara Rodriguez said the supply deficit is currently at 10,000 cubic meters per day, with a total production of 223,000 cubic meters per day. The total demand for water in Metro Cebu was an average of 500,000 cubic meters.   “Supply problems were experienced this month in areas due to leaks, non-operation of wells due to power outages, and maintenance of MCWD facilities,” Kara explained. She said, however, that new wells scheduled to open in February and March should help add to the daily output of water production.   Additional water supply from Pilipinas Water Resources Incorporated in Mambaling is expected to add 5,000 cubic meters per day, while water sourced from Danao City is expected to add an additional 10,000 cubic meters per day.  But even with the additional sources of water, the supply would still be producing only 47% of total water demand in Metro Cebu. The MCWD, however, acknowledged that the amount of rainfall that will come in the summer months to replenish the water supply in the Buhisan and Jaclupan dams is unpredictable. While they recognized the important of water in combating the spread of viruses, they still encouraged the public to practice water conservation in their homes. “MCWD is advising the public to use water wisely so everyone can enjoy it. Let’s conserve where we can so we will have enough supply even during the summer months.” Kara said. From 2016 to 2019, Cebu City and the Province of Cebu had declared a state of calamity on diffent occasions due to drought, brought about by El Niño.  When water supply is low, the MCWD said they could deliver water to barangays where there is no service. The water district spokesperson said coordination for water deliveries would be done through the barangays and local government units.The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international emergency. The death is currently at 212 as of Friday.

Photo by KD Madrilejos/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (6th UPDATE) – The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday, February 5, reported the Philippines’ 3rd confirmed case of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said that a 60-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, tested postive for 2019-nCoV. She traveled from Wuhan through Hong Kong and arrived in Cebu on January 20, and headed directly  to Bohol. Domingo said that on January 22, the woman consulted a private hospital after developing fever and colds, and was admitted to a  hospital in Bohol. Several samples were taken from the woman on January 23 and January 24. The latter samples were sent to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Australia and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM). Domingo said that the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory sent back the test results on the January 24 samples on January 29, and RITM on January 30 – both came out negative. With her test result for 2019-nCoV negative, the woman was discharged from the hospital 9 days after admission and was allowed to travel back to China on January 31. Domingo said that the RITM later ran tests on the first sample taken from the woman on January 23 after it became capable of testing samples for 2019-nCoV. Domingo said that on February 3, RITM notified the DOH that the January 23 samples tested positive for 2019-nCoV. This showed that the woman was able to mount immunity against the virus by the time the January 24 samples were taken. Asked why it took the DOH two days to report the third confirmed case, Domingo said: ""We found out evening of February 3, and yesterday we were at the Senate. As you well know, the secretary was there the whole day, so we couldn’t have a press conference yesterday."" He added that the the DOH's regional office in Central Visayas was immediately notified and that they were able to begin contact tracing on Tuesday, February 4. ""Before we announce it, we make sure the regional office and the local government units already know,"" Domingo said. The first two 2019-nCoV cases in the country were a couple who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak. The man died on February 1, the first death due to the virus outside China. 133 cases probed The DOH said it is now probing a total of 133 patients for 2019-nCoV. As of February 5, 115 patients are admitted to hospitals, while 16 were discharged but were being contacted by DOH surveillance officers daily for updates on their symptoms. Two patients under investigation have died, one of whom tested negative for the virus and died due to other complications. The DOH added that 63 of the patients under investigation are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese, and 16 other foreign nationals. Of this number, 32 traveled from Wuhan, China, while others came from Hong Kong and other parts of China. The DOH also confirmed that health workers are included in the 54 Filipino patients under investigation. Here is the breakdown of suspected cases per region: Meanwhile, a Canadian who was quarantined in Bacolod City for suspected symptoms of novel coronavirus tested negative, according to Dr Julius Drilon, medical center chief of Corazan Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH), on Wednesday, February 5. Drilon said the 43-year-old patient, who came from Taiwan, tested negative in the confirmatory test conducted by the RITM. He said the patient was set to be discharged from the government hospital. Drilon added that two more persons under investigation were still confined at the hospital's Emerging Infectious Disease Facility, awaiting for the laboratory results from RITM. In a statement, AirAsia said it was working closely with the government, especially the DOH, after it was confirmed that the Philippines’ 3rd case of 2019-nCoV took an AirAsia flight from Cebu to Shenzhen, China, on January 31. “AirAsia is ready and willing to provide relevant documents to the DOH, including the flight manifest and available contact details of guests on board the flight, given the urgency of this situation. The operating flight crew have also been quarantined in compliance with the Philippine government’s travel ban,” it said. “All AirAsia aircraft undergo disinfection procedures according to prescribed protocol,” the airline added. AirAsia urged passengers of flight Z2 7800, which left Cebu for Shenzhen at 11:35 am on January 31, to seek medical attention if they feel unwell. Following the government directive, the airline has cancelled its flights between the Philippines and China, Hong Kong, and Macao.
