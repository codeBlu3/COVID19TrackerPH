2020-02-06,nCov,'Olympics will go ahead': Tokyo organizers slam virus rumors,"Alastair Himmer, Agence France-Presse","

TOKYO—Tokyo 2020 Olympics organizers said Thursday the Games would ""go ahead as planned,"" slamming misinformation over the new coronavirus for triggering panic.
Chief executive officer Toshiro Muto revealed that organizers had set up a task force to combat the fast-spreading disease that has killed over 560 people and infected at least 28,000 -- the vast majority in mainland China -- but promised that the Games would be not derailed.
""The Olympics will go ahead as planned,"" he told reporters after a Paralympic project review.
""It is important to remain objective and cool-headed. We don't want to alarm the public. The infection is still limited and there is no problem staging the Olympics based on the current situation.""
International Paralympic Committee (IPC) spokesman Craig Spence complained that scaremongering had created an ""info-demic"" that could skew public perception in the run-up to the Olympics and Paralympics.
""Fear is spreading quicker than the virus,"" he said. ""It's important we quell that fear. Only 191 of the total cases are outside mainland China, so let's put things into perspective.
""If you compare those rates with the common flu, they are still relatively small numbers,"" added Spence.
""The World Health Organization (WHO) has not declared this a pandemic. We dealt with the Zika virus in Rio and in these matters we need to rely on the experts.
""We will follow the advice of the World Health Organization. Every organizing committee looks into countermeasures, and we have measures in place from previous Olympics and Paralympics here in Tokyo. It is standard practice, it's business as usual.""
More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the flu-like coronavirus.
GLOBAL PANIC
Japan has had no reported deaths so far, but 45 cases have been detected, including at least 20 people on a cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew quarantined off Yokohama.
The WHO has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
Japan has warned citizens against non-essential travel to China and fast-tracked new rules including limits on entering the country as it tries to contain the spread of the virus.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday pledged that preparations for the Olympics would proceed as normal.
""The coronavirus is beginning to have an impact on tourism,"" he said. ""But the government will continue to steadily prepare for the Games in close cooperation with the IOC (International Olympic Committee), the local organizing committee and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.""
The Japanese government has chartered 3 flights to repatriate 565 Japanese nationals from Wuhan, the central Chinese city hardest hit by the virus.
Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike promised at the weekend to implement ""thorough measures"" to protect people from the virus.
The health scare has led to the cancellation of Olympic qualifying events in China such as boxing and badminton.
The Tokyo Olympics begin on July 24 with the Paralympics starting on Aug. 25.

MANILA - The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) has warned its member-hospitals to accept all patients with suspected infection of the new coronavirus.
Should accredited medical institutions refuse to provide care to patients, the state health insurance agency said they will be dealt with by the corporation accordingly.
""Refusal to provide care to said patients shall be considered a violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the Corporation accordingly,"" PhilHealth president and chief executive officer Ricardo Morales said in a statement released Wednesday.
All accredited level 2 and 3 hospitals, which have the capacity to perform quarantine and manage infectious diseases, are directed to accept suspected cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) for assessment and appropriate management, Morales added.
PhilHealth also reiterated that the World Health Organization (WHO) had already declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
""PhilHealth is working hand in hand with the Department of Health and other concerned agencies to ensure that all Filipinos are protected from risks brought about by this emerging disease,"" Morales said.

Duque: PhilHealth to offer coverage for suspected new coronavirus cases 

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said PhilHealth would offer a special package for its members with symptoms of the new strain of coronavirus.
The package includes a P1,000 per day for each hospital taking care of a suspected nCoV patient, he had said.

Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

As of Wednesday, the number of confirmed coronavirus infection in the country was 3, including a Chinese man who died from severe pneumonia on Feb. 1. It was the first recorded nCoV-related death outside China.

China virus death tolls rises to 560: govt 

Philippine health authorities are also monitoring 178 patients for possible infection of the virus, which has killed nearly 600 in China.

The Philippine Sports Commission on Thursday said that a number of national events has been postponed, as the country deals with the 2019 novel coronavirus. 
The PSC has also proposed moving the 10th ASEAN Paragames at a later date.
In a press conference, PSC chairman William Ramirez said the National Sports Summit 2020, the Philippine National Games, Batang Pinoy, and Children’s Games will be rescheduled, although no dates were mentioned.
Seminars and other gatherings with 40 or more participants have also been shelved indefinitely.
Ramirez said that his office also recommended the postponement of the 10th ASEAN Paragames, which is penciled for March 20 to 28.
“We have a board resolution advising the Paralympics to possibly postpone the games,” he said.
The decision comes down to the Philippine Paralympic Committee.
PPC president Mike Barredo said he will fly to Thailand on Friday to discuss the issue with the ASEAN Para Sports Federation.
Amid the global spread of the 2019 nCoV acute respiratory disease, the PSC is focused on the welfare of the athletes and coaches bound for the Tokyo Olympics later this year.
“In terms of preventive measures, we have put out information materials for our national athletes and coaches,” said Marc Velasco, the PSC chief of staff and the national training director.
“The PSC Board will not approve any foreign trips and exposures to China. Caution will be exercised on allowing athletes and coaches traveling to other countries for international competitions

(UPDATE) Malayo sa mga ordinaryong pag-uwi sa bansa ang pagdadaanan ng mga Pinoy na uuwi galing Hubei, ang lalawigan sa China na nakasasakop sa lungsod na sinasabing pinagmulan ng isang bagong strain ng coronavirus.
Kahit wala kasing ipinapakitang sintomas ang balikbayan, kailangan nitong dumaan sa 2 linggong quarantine, ayon sa Department of Health (DOH).
""We plan to bring back our fellow Filipinos here in the country as seamlessly and efficiently as possible,"" sabi ngayong Huwebes ni Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
Paglapag ng chartered flight sa Hubei, walang bababang flight crew at mga tauhan lang ng DOH ang haharap sa mga uuwing Pinoy para matingnan ang mga ito.

Kapag nakitaan ng sakit, hindi pasasakayin ang mga Pinoy at idederetso sa ospital sa Hubei.
Kapag nakasakay naman na lahat sa eroplano, agad itong lilipad pabalik ng Pilipinas.
Pagdating sa Pilipinas, dadaan sa screening ng Bureau of Quarantine ang mga balikbayan, ayon kay Duque.
Nakasuot ng personal protective equipment ang lahat ng taong kabilang sa mga tututok sa pagdating ng mga Pinoy.
Ang mga Pinoy na makikitaan ng mga sintomas ay agad ipapasok sa mga ospital bilang patients under investigation habang iyong mga asymptomatic o hindi makikitaan ng sintomas ay dadalhin sa quarantine facility sa New Clark City.
Isang kuwarto ang ilalaan kada isang tao pero kaya rin ng kuwartong ma-accommodate ang pamilya na may 3 miyembro.
""We will be providing the needed medical logistics, including hygiene kits, disinfectant solutions, transportation, and other things that will be needed in the quarantine process,"" ani Duque.
Limitado ang galaw ng mga naka-quarantine sa gusali kung saan lang sila nakatira.
Target ng gobyerno na maiuwi ang mga Pinoy ngayong weekend.
Apatnapu't limang Pinoy na ang nagsasabing gusto nilang umuwi ng bansa, ayon kay Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Brigido Dulay.
May 178 taong itinuturing na patients under investigation o pinaghihinalaang may novel coronavirus, ayon kay Duque.

SPECIAL FLIGHT PA-CHINA
Samantala, dahil sa laki ng demand ng mga banyagang pasahero sa Pilipinas na papuntang China, magsasagawa ng special flight ang Philippine Airlines (PAL) sa Lunes, Pebrero 10, ayon sa tagapagsalita ng airline.
Ito ay sa kabila ng ibinabang ban ng Pilipinas sa pagbiyahe papunta at pabalik ng Mainland China, Hong Kong at Macau bilang pag-iingat sa pagkalat ng novel coronavirus.
Lilipad nang balikan mula Ninoy Aquino International Airport at Xiamen, China ang eroplano.
Hindi bababa ng eroplano ang flight crew at piloto, pero pagbalik ng Pilipinas ay sasailalim ang mga ito sa 2 linggong quarantine, ayon kay PAL Spokesperson Cielo Villaluna.
Nasa 27,300 na ang nahawahan ng novel coronavirus, karamihan ay galing sa China, habang hindi bababa sa 560 ang namatay.
Sa Pilipinas, 3 na ang kumpirmadong kaso ng novel coronavirus, kabilang ang isang lalaking Chinese na pumanaw dito at isang babaeng pasyenteng nakabalik na ng China bago pa nakumpirmang positibo siya sa virus.
Samantala, isang Pinay household worker naman sa Dubai ang naiulat na nasawi dahil sa hindi pa natutukoy na strain ng coronavirus, ayon kay Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III.
Hindi malinaw kung alin sa mga uri ng coronavirus ang ikinamatay ng 58 anyos na overseas worker, na galing General Santos City at 28 taon nang nagtatrabaho doon, ani Bello.

2020-02-06,nCov,ALAMIN: Bayad ba ang quarantine ng empleyadong na-expose sa 2019-nCoV?,"Joyce Balancio at Johnson Manabat, ABS-CBN News","

MAYNILA — Sa pagdami ng ulat ng kumpirmado at hinihinalang kaso ng 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) sa Pilipinas, sinusubukan ng Health officials na mapigilan pa ang pagkalat ng virus sa bansa. 

Pangatlong kaso ng novel coronavirus sa PH naitala sa babaeng Chinese

Isa sa paraan na epektibo ay ang pag-quarantine o pag-iwas sa pakikihalubilo sa tao upang hindi na kumalat pa ang sakit. Inirerekomenda ng mga awtoridad na hindi bababa sa 14 araw o 2 linggo ang gagawing quarantine para sigurado. 
Pero kapag hindi nakapagtrabaho ang empleyado dahil sa quarantine, sino ang dapat sumagot sa sahod nito? 
Iginigiit ng Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) na dapat magkaroon ng ""14-day paid quarantine leave/hazard pay"" para sa lahat ng mga manggagawang kinakailangang maisailalim sa quarantine period.
Ayon kay TUCP president Raymond Mendoza, dapat na bayaran ng gobyerno at ng private sector ang kanilang mga empleyado na na-expose sa novel coronavirus.
Sabi naman ng Bureau of Local Employment (BLE) ng Department of Labor and Employment na dapat ibawas ang quarantine period sa leave credits ng empleyado. 
""Puwede po gamitin leave credits, pag wala nang leave credits, no-work-no-pay will apply po,"" ani BLE director Dominique Tutay.
Samantala, sinabi pa ni Tutay na maaari namang maging opsiyon ang work from home scheme. 
""Work from home is an option as we already have a law on telecommuting.""

2020-02-06,nCov,Thousands quarantined on Asian cruise ships in virus fight,"Harumi Ozawa, Agence France-Presse","

YOKOHAMA - Thousands of people were stranded aboard 2 cruise ships in Asia on Thursday, quarantined by officials desperate to stem the spread of a deadly virus that has killed hundreds in China and spread panic worldwide.
At least 20 people on board 1 ocean liner off the Japanese coast have tested positive for the new coronavirus, with thousands more staring at a 2-week seaborne isolation. 
The outbreak on the vessel, whose 3,700 passengers and crew hail from over 50 countries, is the latest development in a snowballing global health emergency that has left more than 560 people dead, most of them in China.
Tens of thousands of people have been infected, including a few hundred in around 2 dozen countries.
The World Health Organization, which has declared the outbreak a global health emergency, on Wednesday appealed for $675 million to fight the virus.
In Japan, more than 3,700 people were stuck on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been held off the port city of Yokohama since Monday night.
Authorities decided to quarantine the ship and test hundreds on board after a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month tested positive for the virus.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament on Thursday that results for 102 people had now come in, with 20 testing positive for the new strain.
In all, 273 people on board were tested, including those who had close contact with the former passenger and others displaying potential symptoms.
The first 10 people diagnosed with the new virus have already been removed from the ship, which on Thursday docked in Yokohama to resupply for a quarantine that could last until Feb. 19.
Ambulances arrived at the port, where officials could be seen dressed in white full-body protective suits, complete with face masks and helmets, to remove the additional 10 people who have tested positive.
An extendable white-tented passageway was wheeled to a door on the side of the massive cruise ship, apparently to protect the identity of people being evacuated from the boat.
'FLOATING PRISON'
""We are confined here full time,"" British passenger David Abel said in a Facebook Live video.
""The meals have completely changed. We are definitely not on a luxury cruise!... It's going to be like a floating prison.""
In Hong Kong, 3,600 passengers and crew spent the night marooned on board the cruise ship World Dream as authorities conducted health checks after 3 former passengers tested positive for the virus.
City health officials said passengers would only be allowed off after tests were completed, with crew checked first and passengers to be screened on Thursday.
Two dozen countries now have confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus that emerged from a Wuhan market selling exotic animals at the end of last year.
China is struggling with a shortage of hospital beds, equipment and materials to treat those infected, despite building 2 hospitals from scratch and converting public buildings to house patients.
'DON'T GO OUT!'
Tens of millions of people, from the eastern industrial heartlands to near the northern border with Russia, have been told to stay indoors as authorities battle to curb the outbreak.
In parts of Hangzhou, 175 kilometers (110 miles) from Shanghai, new restrictions allow only 1 person per household to go outside every 2 days.
""Please don't go out. Don't go out. Don't go out!"" blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people from Hubei -- reflecting a common fear that people from the province might infect others.
Several governments have imposed travel restrictions over the virus, while major airlines have suspended flights to and from China.
Italy announced that passengers on every international flight would be scanned for fever and on Thursday Taiwan banned all international cruise ships from docking.
China has reacted angrily to the travel bans, noting that the WHO does not advise imposing them.
Health experts note that the mortality rate of the new virus, at around 2 percent, is well below that of SARS, which killed 800 people in 2002-2003, around 10 percent of those infected.
Two fatalities have been reported outside the mainland, in Hong Kong and the Philippines.

BEIJING - Students blocked from returning to their universities; tourists forced to extend expensive holidays; a scientist cut off from her lab in the United States: coronavirus entry bans are wreaking havoc on the plans of thousands of Chinese travelers.
From the US to Australia and Israel, several countries have banned entry to foreigners who have recently been in China, while major airlines have suspended flights to and from the country.
AFP spoke to 4 Chinese people in limbo:
EXTENDED VACATION
After traveling to Japan from the Chinese city of Chongqing for a skiing holiday in the mountains of Hokkaido, Wang Bili was supposed to return to Washington, where he works for an international organization, on Feb. 10.
""The American decision was a total shock,"" he said.
""I had to change my tickets for a later date to comply with the incubation period.""
Now he will not be able to return to Washington until mid-February, but he said he doubted whether the US decision would be effective.
""They can't know when a Chinese person left China,"" he said, noting that China does not stamp the passports of its citizens when they leave.
But the main thing bugging the 32-year old is the cost of extending his stay in Japan.
""This will cost me another $1,000,"" he said. ""I'm annoyed but what can I do?""
SYDNEY STUDENT
Like other Chinese students who were back at home when Australia announced its restrictions, Chloe has not been able to return to her university Down Under.
""Some Chinese students didn't even find out about it until they got off the plane in Australia. Then they had to pay out of their own pockets for a flight back to China,"" she said.
She is worried about paying her rent in Sydney, and being evicted if she cannot.
""Will we be able to graduate? It's really a hassle. All of this is upsetting the plans we had for the next 2 or 3 years.""
Her plans to take a holiday in New Zealand before term started again were also ruined, when the country announced similar restrictions.
""I've lost a lot of money in canceled hotel bookings.""
RESEARCH HALTED
When Sherry Huang first heard about the US travel ban, she felt shocked.
""How could such a strict measure come out so suddenly?"" said the 36-year-old, who is staying at her parents' home in Xiamen, in the southeastern province of Fujian.
Huang, who does biomedical research in the United States, had last visited China in 2016. This year was a rare chance to gather with family over the Lunar New Year holiday.
But the Chinese researcher is now stuck on the mainland after Washington banned all foreign nationals who have traveled to China in the last 2 weeks.
That means her lab experiments -– which she cannot conduct remotely –- have been suspended until she returns.
""This is a key time period,"" Huang emphasized. ""I have made some very interesting findings and we can make some new discoveries soon.""
If research is suspended now, she said, the impact will be ""pretty large.""
""China is so big -– implementing a travel ban on an entire country is not reasonable,"" said Huang. ""Such a large-scale travel ban will impact many people's lives.""
NO INFORMATION
A second-year student at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Xiao Shen said he has not heard anything from his university or Australian authorities since the ban. 
""Everything I know has come from the news,"" he fumed.
""Australia hasn't told us anything, nothing on whether term has been postponed or if we'll be able to take our classes over the internet... it's really irresponsible. I'm angry."" 
As Chinese students are forced to defer studies, top Australian universities stand to lose around $2 billion in fees alone, according to preliminary estimates from analysts at Standard & Poor's.
Xiao thinks Australia should only have banned entry to tourists, or those coming from Hubei province at the epicenter of the virus. 
""I understand it's for safety reasons but it's too much. They haven't thought about how it will impact foreign students at all.""

SYDNEY - The coronavirus outbreak could deliver a painful multi-billion-dollar hit to Australian universities, as high-paying Chinese students are forced to defer their studies, economists warned Thursday.
Top universities stand to lose around US$2 billion (Aus$3 billion) in fees alone, according to preliminary estimates from analysts at Standard & Poor's.
Under open-ended travel restrictions imposed by the government in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, non-Australian citizens or permanent residents who have been in China since Feb. 1 are not allowed into Australia.
The virus's outbreak came in between Australia's academic years -- which begin in February -- and as many of the country's roughly 165,000 Chinese university students had returned home for the Lunar New Year.
""Our calculation is one of higher-education fee revenues only, and excludes the broader economic contribution from students to accommodation, tourism, and domestic consumption of goods and services,"" S&P said in a report.
Foreign students are a vital income stream for Australian universities and one that has grown exponentially in recent years.
Australia is now 1 of the top 3 destinations for foreign students worldwide.
Student representatives told AFP that many of those students have not been able to return in time to start this semester and fear missing the whole year because of the way courses are constructed.
Universities have offered to defer placements and reimburse tuition fees, but many are also trying to buy time.
The University of Sydney has extended the last date students have to be on campus to March 30 -- more than a month after classes were due to begin -- and is trying to arrange for remote teaching.
Australia's top universities are expected to be disproportionately hit, but they should be able to absorb the blow, at least temporarily.
""We believe they have some buffer in free cash, leverage, and operating margin ratios to absorb a temporary shock to revenues,"" S&P said.

HONG KONG - Panic buyers in Hong Kong have descended on supermarkets to snap up toilet rolls as the government warned that online rumors of shortages were hampering the city's fight against a deadly coronavirus outbreak.
Videos obtained by AFP showed long queues of frantic shoppers packing trolleys with multiple packets of toilet rolls, with some arguments breaking out.
Rice and pasta have also become a popular target for panic buying.
The footage -- and photos of shelves emptied of toilet rolls -- sparked a call from the government for the public to halt panic buying. 
""In response to various rumors recently that there are shortages of goods such as rice and toilet papers, leading to panic buying and even chaos, a government spokesman today expresses regret over the malicious act of spreading rumors when the city is fighting against the disease, and condemns those rumor mongers with evil intentions,"" the statement said. 
While Hong Kong has closed most of its land borders to mainland China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, freight services have not been affected, the government said.
""There are sufficient stocks of staple food including rice and pastas. There is no need for the public to worry,"" the statement said.
Harold Yip, founder of Mil Mill, a Hong Kong-based waste paper recycling company, told AFP they received over 100 inquiries from members of the public about toilet paper on Wednesday alone.
RTHK news reported that toilet paper and rice at one supermarket in the district of Wanchai -- which had been fully restocked overnight -- were cleared within 30 minutes of the store opening on Thursday morning.
The supermarket chain Wellcome said rumors of shortages were unfounded. 
The coronavirus has killed more than 550 people in China since spreading from the central city of Wuhan late last year. 
Hong Kong now has 21 confirmed infections, including 1 patient who died.
The majority of those infected came from mainland China. 
But in recent days there has been a spike in carriers with no history of travel to the mainland sparking fears local transmissions were growing.
The city's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam has faced growing calls to close the border with China, a step she has been reluctant to take saying it would be economically damaging and discriminatory. 
Her administration has gradually cut the number of land border crossings to just 2.
On Wednesday, she announced anyone arriving from the Chinese mainland from Saturday would face a mandatory 2-week quarantine. 
While Hong Kong maintains close economic and cultural links to the Chinese mainland, as seething distrust of the authorities in Beijing permeates the city.
The 2003 outbreak of the SARS virus, which Beijing initially covered up, killed 299 people in Hong Kong and left lasting psychological scars on the densely populated city.
Lam already boasts record-low approval ratings after using riot police to quell 7 months of huge and often violent pro-democracy protests.

2020-02-06,nCov,WHO investigates Singapore conference linked to foreign virus spread,"John Geddie, Reuters","

SINGAPORE - At least 3 employees of a multinational company that held a meeting of more than 100 international staff in Singapore have contracted the new coronavirus, sparking a World Health Organization investigation of the case.
Malaysia and South Korea have confirmed 3 cases of the virus related to the mid-January company meeting held with 94 overseas staff at the Grand Hyatt hotel, and Singapore said late on Wednesday 4 other attendees were showing symptoms.
Authorities have not revealed the name of the company that held the meeting or said what business it is involved in.
Malaysian health authorities have said people from China including 1 from the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December, attended.
""WHO is coordinating with relevant ministries of health in relation to it,"" Olivia Lawe-Davies, a spokeswoman for the WHO, said in response to questions from Reuters.
""As countries are stepping up surveillance, the detection of more cases of local transmission can be expected.""
Singapore has reported 28 cases of the coronavirus, including some involving person-to-person transmission.
The cases linked to the Singapore business meeting provide more evidence the virus is spreading through human-to-human contact outside China, which the WHO has said is deeply concerning and could signal a much larger outbreak.
China reported its biggest daily jump in fatalities from the virus on Thursday, up 73 to 563, although there have been only 2 reported deaths outside mainland China.
Malaysian health authorities first revealed the link to the Singapore business meeting when they confirmed the case of a 41-year-old Malaysian who had attended it, along with colleagues from China.
South Korea subsequently confirmed 2 cases involving South Korean who attended the conference. The Koreans and the Malaysian shared a buffet meal during the conference, South Korean media reported.
Of the 15 Singapore attendees, 4 have been referred to its National Center for Infectious Diseases, Singapore's health ministry said. All the overseas attendees have left Singapore, the ministry added.
A spokesman for the Grand Hyatt, Gerald Kheng, said the hotel had been deep cleaned after it was first informed of the incident by the health ministry on Tuesday and it was not aware of any other cases among guests or staff.

TAIPEI - Workers making iPhones at tech giant Foxconn's plant in central China will be quarantined for up to 2 weeks, the company said Thursday, as cities on the mainland tighten their defenses against the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
Also known by its official name Hon Hai Precision Industry, Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and assembles Apple's iPhones, as well as gadgets for other international brands.
Foxconn's vast network of factories in China, including one of its largest in Zhengzhou in central Henan province, are set to resume operations on Feb. 10 after an extended Lunar New Year holiday caused by the outbreak. 
But the company said it has advised instate and out-of-state employees at the Zhengzhou plant to be quarantined for 7 and 14 days, respectively, in accordance with local government policies.
China's industrial base has been buffeted by the outbreak of the virus, which began in the manufacturing hub of Wuhan in central China but has since spread to more than 20 countries. 
The number of confirmed infections has hit more than 28,000 in China while death toll passed 560 in an outbreak that has spiraled into a global health emergency.
The virus is also set to have an impact on international supply chains and manufacturing given China's lynchpin role in the global economy. 
Foxconn now projects a sales increase of 1 to 3 percent this year, down from a January forecast of 3 to 5 percent, chairman Young Liu told Bloomberg News.
Foxconn has tried to allay fears of production shortfalls, saying it had previous experience of viral outbreaks following the SARS epidemic in 2003. 
It is China's biggest private-sector employer with more than 30 factories and research facilities -- including 1 in Wuhan.
Taiwan has reported 11 confirmed cases so far, mostly people returning from Wuhan.
The government announced Thursday that all foreigners who resided or visited China, Hong Kong or Macau in the past 14 days will be temporarily barred from entering the island. 
Foreigners with residency permits in Taiwan returning from these areas must undergo a 14-day stay-home quarantine.

MANILA—Getting vaccinated against flu and pneumonia may help protect people against the new coronavirus, a health expert said Wednesday.
""Magpabakuna kayo because it might save your life. Kahit wala pa tayong nCoV na vaccine, meron naman tayong vaccine sa trangkaso at sa iba't ibang bagay, sa pneumonia,"" Dr. Edsel Maurice Salvana of the National Institute of Health (NIH) said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay press forum. 
(Get vaccinated because it might save your life. Though we don't have a vaccine against nCoV, we have vaccines for flu and pneumonia.)
He said the majority of the 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) fatalities had underlying health problems.
""Kasi nga 'yong mga namatay sa nCoV... karamihan do'n, 70 percent, meron silang preexisting illness, or matandang-matanda or batang-bata... Mas mabubuhay ka kung healthy ka,"" added Salvana, director of the NIH's Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.
(Those who died because of nCoV... About 70 percent of them had preexisiting illness or they were too old or too young... You'll survive if you're healthy.)

First novel coronavirus death outside China recorded in PH - WHO official

The second confirmed case in the Philippines, a 44-year-old man from Wuhan, China, died of severe pneumonia.
""Kung nabakunahan sana siya, baka hindi siya namatay,"" Salvana said.
Meanwhile, another medical doctor urged the elderly to get vaccinated because they are more at risk in getting infections. 
""Anybody above 50 to 55 years old, basta meron underlying disease—mahina ang baga, chronic asthma, may diabetes na uncontrolled, cardiovascular conditions—[it would be] best magpabakuna na kayo against pneumonia because that would really help protect or reduce your chances of infection,"" said Dr. Beaver Tamesis, president of the Philippine Pharmaceutical & Healthcare Association of the Philippines.
(Anybody who is 50 to 55 years old, has underlying disease— weakened lungs, chronic asthma, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular conditions—it is best for you to get vaccinated against pneumonia because that would really help protect or reduce your chances of infection.)
Flu vaccines, for example, must be taken annually, especially between May to August, Tamesis said.
""It can shorten your illness—from 10 days to as short as 1, 2 days or even just hours or totally protect you against the infection,"" he said.
To date, there is no medicine to prevent or treat those infected with the new coronavirus, but health authorities are racing to develop a treatment.

Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

The Philippines on Wednesday confirmed its third case of the 2019-nCoV ARD—a 60-year-old woman from Wuhan, the epicenter of the respiratory contagion. She has since gone back to China after overcoming the disease. 

Patients under watch for new coronavirus in PH now at 133

Health authorities are also monitoring 133 patients for possible infection of the virus, which has killed nearly 500 in China.

An event in Manila that was supposed to be attended by K-pop boy band EXO has been cancelled amid concerns over the 2019 novel coronavirus.
The band was set to hold an event in February 22 to mark the 8th anniversary of South Korean cosmetics brand Nature Republic in the Philippines.
But fears over the 2019 novel coronavirus, which has infected over 24,000 worldwide and killed nearly 500, prompted organizers to cancel the event.

 
“We regret to inform all of you that the ‘Journey to the Nature Republic in Manila’ on Feb. 22, 2020 will be cancelled,” Nature Republic Philippines announced in a Facebook post on Wednesday.
EXO debuted in 2012 under SM Entertainment, one of the major players in the K-pop industry.

MANILA - Baguio City is not on lockdown amid the threat of the new coronavirus, its mayor clarified on Wednesday.
""Wala pong lockdown sa Baguio (There's no lockdown in Baguio.) We are still open to visitors and tourists,"" city mayor Benjamin Magalong told radio DZMM.
He made the announcement after Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana earlier said the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) homecoming may be rescheduled due to a supposed city-wide lockdown for tourists and visitors.
""Gusto ko lang pong klaruhin dahil honest mistake ko naman po 'yong nabanggit niya (I just wanted to clarify because what he mentioned was my mistake),"" Magalong said.
Due to the growing spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD), the city had also postponed several crowd-drawing activities, such as the Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic (CARAA) Meet and International Jazz Festival.

The city had already canceled the opening parade of the Panagbenga Festival and would still have to decide if it would push through with the grand street parade and grand float parade scheduled on Feb. 29 and March 1, respectively.
""Pag-uusapan po namin kung ano ang gagawin namin do'n. Malalaman niyo po next week kung itutuloy o ipo-postpone (We will still have to decide what to do with it. You will learn next week if it will push through or postponed),"" he said.

During the interview, Magalong said English as a Second Language (ESL) schools are also closely monitoring foreign students, especially Chinese, studying in Baguio.
""Everyday tinitingnan ang kanilang condition, mini-measure ang kanilang temperature (They are checking their conditions and measuring their temperatures everyday),"" he said, adding the schools have also temporarily refused accepting students.
As temperature in Baguio continues to drop, Magalong also allayed fears that flu may be common in the city because of the colder weather.
""Marami po kaming respiratory problems, cases dito dahil malamig... kaya may flu-like symptoms kami rito at tinututukan po ng Department of Health (DOH) (We have many respiratory cases here because of the cold weather... that's why some are exhibiting flu-like symptoms and the DOH is on top of it),"" he said.
On Wednesday, the city's temperature is expected to drop to 11 degree Celsius due to amihan or northeast monsoon, which brings cold air from the northern hemisphere, according to state weather bureau PAGASA.

MANILA - The number of patients being observed for possible infection of the new coronavirus has increased to 133, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.

READ: Patients checked for new coronavirus in PH rise to 105

“We have a cumulative total since the beginning of 133 PUIs [patients under investigation]. Of the 133 PUIs, 115 are admitted and isolated while 16 have been discharged under strict monitoring,” Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said in a press conference.
PUIs are those who recently traveled to China, where the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) originated, and show signs of illness such as fever, colds and cough.
Of those being checked, 63 are Filipinos, 54 are Chinese and 16 are of other nationalities. Thirty-two of them had traveled to Wuhan City in China, where the first cases of the new coronavirus were reported.
Bacolod City, meanwhile, said two men are under quarantine in a hospital for having history of travel to areas where cases of the new coronavirus have been recorded.
Dr. Grace Tan, spokesperson of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease Inter-Agency Task Force, said one of the patients under investigation is a 67-year-old foreigner who had a layover in Taiwan prior to his flight back to the Philippines and Negros Occidental on Jan. 21.
The other PUI is a 40-year-old Filipino who traveled to Hong Kong and returned home on Jan. 27.
Medical Center Chief II Dr. Julius Drilon said they are still waiting for results of the test conducted on two other PUIs who have been quarantined since Feb. 1 and 3.
In Tarlac, 6 PUIs tested negative for the virus, the Tarlac provincial government said in a Facebook post. Gov. Susan Yap said the capitol is undertaking all measures to prevent the spread of the virus 
As of Wednesday, the Philippines has 3 confirmed cases of the virus. The first 2 are a Chinese couple from Wuhan, China. The 44-year-old man died but the 38-year-old woman is recovering and no longer showing signs of illness but remains in hospital. 
Meanwhile, the third case is a 60-year-old woman who was belatedly diagnosed. She was already cured and cleared to return to China when test results arrived confirming that she was infected with the disease.

READ: Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case

Contact tracing for the Chinese couple yielded 203 contacts so far. Of that number, 188 are quarantined at home but 15 are showing symptoms of illness. 
While the 14 are already in isolation, DOH is seeking local government and police assistance to bring the last person to the hospital. “He initially refused to be admitted,” Domingo explained.
The DOH is still calling on other passengers of Cebu Pacific flight 5J 241 from Hong Kong to Cebu on Jan. 20 and 21, 2020; Cebgo flight DG6519 from Cebu to Dumaguete on Jan. 21, 2020; and Philippine Airlines flight PR 2542 from Dumaguete to Manila on Jan. 25, 2020 to cooperate with authorities.
The DOH Epidemiology Bureau has also started contact tracing those who interacted with the 3rd confirmed case. These will be those from her Hong Kong to Cebu flight on Jan. 20 and her subsequent flight to Bohol. 
As far as the DOH is concerned, she was no longer infectious during her flight from Bohol to Cebu and then back to China.
As of Wednesday, at least 490 people have died because of the disease while 20,000 are infected, most of them from China.

HANOI - Vietnam is setting up field hospitals with thousands of beds to handle a potential influx of coronavirus cases, health officials said, as it prepares to receive its nationals from China.
Vietnam shares a long porous border with China and the communist neighbors have close trade and tourism ties. 
So far Vietnam has 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus -- including 3 people with no recent travel history to China.
The virus, declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, has so far killed nearly 500 people and infected more than 24,000, mostly in mainland China. 
Travel restrictions, flight bans and quarantines have been imposed as countries ramp up efforts to control the fast-spreading pathogen.
In Vietnam's southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh city -- where 3 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed -- 2 existing facilities are being converted into field hospitals with a total capacity of 500 beds. 
They will ""receive, monitor and treat"" all suspected patients of coronavirus if the epidemic spreads further, according to the director of the city's health department, Nguyen Tan Binh.
In Hanoi, 2 military facilities have been turned into quarantine centers for up to 1,500 people as the country prepares to receive 950 people from China to be isolated at the sites. 
Two provinces in northern Vietnam near the China border have also set up beds for close to 3,000 patients. Central Vietnam has centers ready for as many as 3,700. 
Vietnam has not announced plans to repatriate it citizens from China en masse, though 21 Vietnamese students in Wuhan -- the center of the epidemic -- could be brought back on a chartered flight, the government said.
Vietnam has banned all flights to and from mainland China and suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who have been there in the past 2 weeks.
All passenger trains to and from China have also been halted.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong was testing over 1,800 passengers and crew on a cruise ship for a coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, after some crew members reported having fever and other symptoms.
Authorities were not letting anyone leave the ship without permission.
The Chinese-ruled city's health department said Wednesday 90 percent of the passengers were Hong Kongers and no mainland Chinese were on board. 
Previously, 3 mainland Chinese that had been on the ship between Jan. 19 and 24 were found to have contracted the virus.
The World Dream ship, operated by Dream Cruises, was denied entry in the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung on Tuesday. On Monday, the ship visited Taiwan's northern Keelung port.
It was not clear how long passengers and crew would be kept on the ship.

MANILA - Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra on Wednesday stood by his earlier directive ordering the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate peddlers of ""fake news"" about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
In a message to reporters, Guevarra said crimes under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act may be filed against those responsible.
‪""If the intent in causing the publication of false information is to create or aggravate public disorder, or undermine government efforts during a state of public emergency, and such publication is effected by means of information technology, appropriate charges under the Revised Penal Code in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Law may be filed against perpetrators,"" he said.
No Philippine law, however, defines or punishes ""fake news."" 
Asked for guidelines on how to determine ""fake news,"" Guevarra said he would leave it to the cybercrime experts of the DOJ and the NBI.
""The DOJ and the NBI have their own cybercrime experts. I suppose they’ll scope the field muna and see if there’s a malicious scheme or pattern somewhere,"" he said.
GUEVARRA: PROBE MY IDEA
Guevarra insisted investigating peddlers of ""fake news"" about the new coronavirus was his idea.
""I have personally observed a slew of internet/social media communications that tend to sow panic and confusion regarding this public health issue, and it was also raised during the Senate hearing yesterday. Malacañang had nothing to do with it,"" he said.
He added: ""There are limitations to this constitutional right, including the greater interest of the public.""
The Supreme Court had previously struck down the government's attempt to prevent the airing of ""Hello Garci"" tapes, which purportedly showed then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo instructing a Comelec official to rig the 2004 polls.
In the 2008 case of Chavez vs. Gonzales, the high court considered a form of prior restraint the statement of then-Justice Secretary Raul Gonzales and a press release from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) warning radio and broadcast media that the airing of “Hello Garci” tapes will result in the cancellation of their certificates of authority.
 
SC said the warning regulated the content of the speech and prior restraint could only be justified if there was a clear and present danger sought to be avoided.
Guevarra said the clear and present danger the government seeks to avoid in this case is ""causing undue panic and alarm in part, but also undermining government efforts for a unified and coordinated approach to a common threat that affects us all.""
""The nCoV threat is a very serious public concern and no distraction of government efforts to overcome it will be tolerated,"" he said.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte wants to personally welcome Filipinos coming from China, the origin of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, a Palace official claimed Wednesday, as the Philippines prepares for the arrival of the first batch of repatriates on Saturday.
Duterte wants to see the arrival of the repatriates but there are still ongoing discussions with the Presidential Security Group (PSG) and Presidential Management Staff (PMS) over his security, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told reporters in Malacañang.
“The President wants to be there. He’d like to be there on Saturday pero tingnan na muna natin sa (let’s see with the) PMS and PSG,” Nograles said.
The President had ordered Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to welcome the repatriates and to ensure that protective measures are in place, Nograles added.
Malacañang on Wednesday said the repatriates would arrive at the Clark International Airport and transported to Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija for a 14-day mandatory quarantine.
As of Wednesday, 42 Filipinos have expressed their desire to come home, according to Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Eduardo Menez.

Filipinos repatriated from China virus epicenter to arrive Saturday

The President, who earlier said that the virus outbreak was “nothing really to be extra-scared of,” also rejected calls of his staff to limit his public engagements for the meantime, Nograles said.
“He (Duterte) just wants to keep on doing the things he’s doing without imposing limitations sa kaniyang (on his) movement,” the Cabinet secretary said. “He doesn’t want to change the way he conducts his business.”

2020-02-05,nCov,Philippines confirms 3rd new coronavirus case,"Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News","
MANILA (4th UPDATE) - A third Chinese patient tested positive for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the Philippines but has been discharged and returned to China, the country's health ministry said Wednesday.
The announcement came three days after the Philippine government said Manila's second confirmed case led to the patient's death, marking the first novel coronavirus-related fatality outside China amid the outbreak that has spread to more than 20 countries across continents.
Philippine Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said the patient is a 60-year old woman from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the virus. She arrived in Cebu City in the central region, via Hong Kong, on Jan. 20, and then traveled to the neighboring resort island province of Bohol.
""She is the third confirmed 2019-nCoV Acute Respiratory Disease case in the country,"" the health department said in a statement. 
Domingo said the woman, who was traveling with other people, fell ill on her first day in Bohol on Jan. 22. She first stayed in her hotel, but was immediately admitted to a hospital the same day.
Two sets of samples were taken from the patient - one on Jan. 23 and another on Jan. 24. Since the Philippines at the time relied only on Australia's Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory for nCoV infection confirmatory tests, and it can only send limited samples, only the Jan. 24 sample was submitted there.
Results of the tests on the Jan. 24 sample, both by RITM and the VIDRL, ""came back (as) negative,"" Domingo said. They were received on Jan. 29 and 30.
""Upon recovery of the patient, she was discharged and was allowed to return to China via Cebu last Jan. 31,"" the health department said.
Meanwhile, when the RITM acquired the capability to test for 2019-nCoV infection beginning last week, it included the woman's Jan. 23 sample in its examination. This one tested positive for the new virus strain, and the RITM notified the health department on Feb. 3 about the finding.
Domingo said the Department of Health's Epidemiology Bureau has started tracking people who may have interacted or were in close proximity to the patient, especially those in her hotel. The woman’s companions did not exhibit symptoms, he said.
The health department does not consider the woman infectious by Jan. 31 when she was discharged and traveled back to China. But since the positive result came out, efforts to reach her have been made so she can be informed about it.
The passenger traveled to Shenzhen from Cebu on Jan. 31 via flight number Z2 7800, AirAsia said in a statement. 
AirAsia is willing to provide relevant documents to the DOH such as flight manifest and contact details of guests on board the affected flight “given the urgency of the situation,” it said. 
The operating flight crew have been quarantined, while the aircraft will undergo disinfection procedures based on prescribed protocol, the airline said.
“We advise passengers on-board this flight to seek medical help if they have been feeling unwell,” AirAsia said.

Cebu Pacific, PAL helping trace virus patients' co-passengers: spokespersons

Earlier, two Chinese travelers, who also came from Wuhan, tested positive as well for the 2019-nCoV while in the Philippines, although both are classified as ""imported cases."" They arrived, also in Cebu via Hong Kong, last Jan. 21.
The first confirmed case involved a 38-year-old woman, while the second was her companion, a 44-year-old man. The latter, who was also found positive for pneumonia-causing bacteria, died last Saturday, Feb. 1, the first recorded nCoV-related death outside China.
The spread of the outbreak in the Philippines prompted government to ban foreign travelers from all of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. Domestically, the public has been scrambling for limited stocks of masks for their protection. 
On Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte called for calm, saying the public should not be scared as the disease would ""die a natural death.""
As of Wednesday, nearly 500 deaths have been recorded in China, while infections have reached over 24,000 in Chinese cities and other Asia-Pacific countries, North America, and Europe. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
The Philippines has so far reported 133 ""patients under investigation"" (PUIs) for the new coronavirus, including the three confirmed cases and another fatality who was later found negative. Thirty-two of them have reportedly traveled to Wuhan, where the virus was known to have spread from a market that sold wild animals as delicacies.
The PUIs include 63 Filipinos, 54 Chinese, and 16 of other different nationalities.
Of the 133, there are 115 who are currently admitted and isolated.

BACOLOD CITY, Negros Occidental (UPDATE) - A foreign national quarantined at Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH) in this city tested negative of the new coronavirus, the hospital chief said Wednesday.
The 43-year-old male patient will be released from the hospital Wednesday after confirmatory test results from the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City showed he was cleared of the strain, said CLMMRH chief Dr. Julius Drilon.
The foreigner was quarantined due to his history of travel in Taiwan, where positive cases of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) were recorded, said Dr. Jane Juanico of the Department of Health (DOH) Western Visayas.
""The patient can be discharged as soon as he is able and his specialists have issued the necessary clearance,” she added.
The CLMMRH is still monitoring 2 patient under investigation (PUIs) confined at the emerging infection disease facility while waiting for laboratory results from RITM.
""CLMMRH is assuring the public that the hospital is implementing strict infection control measures and protocols in providing treatment to these patients,"" Drilon said in a statement.



Amid growing concern of the possible spread of the virus, the DOH-Western Visayas urged the public to remain calm and vigilant.
“The strengthened surveillance against 2019-nCoV ARD should not cause paranoia. We encourage the public to remain vigilant. We do not want to discriminate. It does not mean that when someone has visited a place where a positive case of nCoV has been recorded, he is already infected,"" said Juanico, head of DOH-Western Visayas' infectious disease section.
As of Wednesday, Feb. 5, the DOH-Western Visayas has recorded 9 PUIs in the region.
Aklan has the most number of recorded PUIs at 6. Two PUIs were recorded in IloIlo and 1 in Negros Occidental.
Juanico said 7 of the 9 PUIs had been discharged from hospitals.

Classes in public schools in Negros Oriental province are suspended from Wednesday until Friday as precautionary measure against the possible spread of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a province official said Tuesday.
Provincial Information Officer Bimbo Miraflor said two sporting events scheduled for this month are also postponed. 
The provincial health office advised parents of students to make sure their children stay at home during the 3-day class suspension. 
Meanwhile, the provincial epidemiology surveillance unit said that 38 patients are being observed for possible infection of the 2019-nCoV, as of this posting.
They compose of staff of the hotel and resort where a Chinese couple -- who tested positive for the virus -- stayed during their trip to Dumaguete City last January.
They also include 2 pedicab drivers who were with the couple, as well as other people they came in contact with.
The Philippines recorded the first new coronavirus-related death outside of China after one of the couple, a 44-year-old Chinese man, died on Saturday.

MANILA - Washing hands frequently is a more effective way to avoid contracting the new coronavirus than using a face mask, a health official said Tuesday.
""Factually, it shows that non-symptomatic people using masks, it will give them a false sense of confidence and put them at more risk because they tend to wash hands less,"" World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said during a Senate hearing. 
""Just because you wear a mask, you should not neglect keeping your hands clean. Because if you touch the mask and you have droplets on the outer surface of the mask that somebody else cough on, you could still get infected. What's actually more important is hand hygiene,"" he added.
Face masks, Abeyasinghe reiterated, should be used by people who are exhibiting respiratory symptoms. It should be reserved for high-risk individuals such as health workers and those who are exposed to crowds. 
""We don’t see a benefit of masks to be used by the general public... This is important now if we have to prevent secondary transmission, especially from PUIs [patients under investigation] and outpatient departments of hospitals,"" he said.

 
Evidence indicates that the 2019-Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) is transmitted between humans through close contact and mostly by people with symptoms. 
""The evidence today is that more than 90 percent of the transmission is attributed to symptomatic people,"" Abeyasinghe said.
To arrest the spread of the virus, he said those with respiratory symptoms must practice proper cough etiquette and hand hygiene.
""Because if you are coughing and your droplets contain this coronavirus, the virus would be present on utensils, on home items, where an infected person has cough,"" Abeyasinghe said, adding pathogens could survive on surfaces for between 8 to 10 hours.
""Make sure that you make an effort to clean surfaces that are handled by those people. This is a infection prevention measure,"" he added.
The 2019-nCoV ARD, which originated from a market that sells illegal wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed at least 425 people and infected nearly 20,000 others in China.

The Philippines is also monitoring 105 patients suspected of carrying the strain.

MANILA - Concerts and other entertainment shows that will gather crowds should be suspended, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Tuesday, amid concerns over the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). 
The Department of Health (DOH) has yet to issue an official advisory on concerts, but it will ""certainly be advising"" on suspending such public events, Duque told senators in a Senate inquiry.
""We might have to forego the holding of such concerts in the meantime,"" he said, responding to a query from Sen. Imee Marcos. 
The government has discouraged the public from staying in crowded, enclosed areas where the deadly novel coronavirus, which has killed over 400 people, can easily be transmitted.
The Philippines has banned travel to and from China earlier this week in a bid to contain the virus. 
Two cases have so far been confirmed in the Philippines- two Chinese nationals who came to the country together from Wuhan, China, the origin of the acute respiratory disease. 
One of them, a 44-year-old man, died on Saturday, becoming the first fatality outside China. The other, a 38-year-old woman, was the first new coronavirus case in the Philippines whose affliction was confirmed last week. She is no longer showing symptoms. 
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has 105 patients under investigation for the virus, the DOH said.

SEOUL - South Korean traders who hoard face masks and other products used to battle the coronavirus outbreak will face up to 2 years in prison, the government announced Tuesday.
The deadly new virus first appeared in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, and has now infected more than 20,000 people, killing 425 and spreading to more than 2 dozen countries.

Concern about the spread of the virus is growing in South Korea, where 16 cases have been identified so far.
Demand for face masks and hand sanitizers has surged, the ministry of economy and finance said, leading to a ""sharp increase in prices"" due to ""hoarding"".
The 2 items were added to a list of designated products, it said.
From Wednesday, sellers who hoard more than one and a half times their average monthly sales volume will face a maximum sentence of 2 years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won ($42,000).
South Korea has so far seen at least 4 cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus, while a hospitalized Chinese tour guide is believed to have caught the illness while working in Japan.
On Tuesday, a Korean woman who recently visited Thailand became its 16th confirmed case.

HONG KONG - Stranded Hong Kong-based overseas Filipino workers and Hong Kong permanent residents who are Philippine passport holders have appealed to President Rodrigo Duterte to reconsider his 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) travel ban as uncertainties have started to take a hit on their work and stay status in Hong Kong. 
An emotional Jefrey Camaya, a father of two, who flew to the Iloilo, Philippines, during the weekend, was disappointed to find out that his flight from Clark to Hong Kong had been cancelled at 5 a.m. yesterday, following the expansion of Duterte's travel ban.

""Ang panawagan ko lang kay President Duterte na please look into it. Bigyan ng consideration ang OFW, ang HK residents. Please look into it na kailangan namin mag-work,"" said Camaya as he turned teary, adding he was starting to miss his family.
(My appeal to President Duterte is to please look into it. Give consideration for overseas Filipino workers and Hong Kong residents. Please look into because we also need to work.)

Camaya's wife and three children are based in Hong Kong. He said his employer has already told him that they ""need to find a way to get back home"". He said it's not true that just because he is a permanent resident in Hong Kong, he can easily find a job anytime.
""Ang problema yung bills [to pay] ngayong buwan na to, yung month na babayaran namin ngayon. Sinong magbibigay nun? Gobyerno ba? Gobyerno ng HK? Ang hirap e,"" said Camaya.
(The problem is the bill this month. Who will pay for that? Is it the government? Government of Hong Kong? It's so difficult.)

Jona Paredes, a domestic worker in Hong Kong, travelled all the way from La Union to Manila from 12 a.m. to 9 a.m. only to find out several hours later that her international flight to the former British colony would not push through after the ban. Paredes said she had spent 15 hours at the airport and left Manila at around 2 a.m. on February 3. 
She said she met somebody from Laoag who offered her some money so she could go home upon learning about her ordeal.
""Yung pera ko, maigi na lang may nagbigay ng pamasahe sa akin. Yung pera ko konti na lang yung deperensiya kaso kailangan ng dagdag. Maigi may nakasabay ako pinamasahian niya ako ng pandagdag pamasahe dito,"" said Paredes.
(My money...it's good that someone gave me money for my fare.) 
She said they were at the boarding gate when 10 minutes before their flight, they were told that their check-in had been put on hold. Then they were told there was a flight delay and announced it three times and would update at 5 p.m. Finally, they were reportedly told there had been some problems with the Philippine government.
They were then told to head back to the immigration area where they were told their flight had finally been cancelled. So, their record at the immigration was ""void"". 
They were told to approach the Cebu Pacific office to see whether they could rebook or refund their flights.

""Pero sa kalaunan din na naghintay na kami after 5 hours nang paghihintay, isa lang naman pala ang option. Refund din, walang rebook kasi hindi nila alam kung kailan daw mag-o-open ulit yung flight ng papunta diyan sa HK,"" said Paredes.
(But after waiting for 5 hours, there was really only one option. It was to refund. No rebooking because they don't know when the flights will be opened going back to Hong Kong.)
Paredes said she is grateful that her employers have been very understanding and would always remind her that her health and safety were most important. She said they discussed options to get her back to Hong Kong and even Singapore was on the table, but it was after she told them that she might encounter problems should she decide to go to Singapore and it may make matters worse. 
They all agreed and were willing to wait for her return without any conditions and because she was told they love her like a family. She will have to look for some ways to make ends meet while she is in the Philippines. 
""Yung wish ko sana assistance kahit magkano ...pero ang pinaka-wish ko talaga is makabalik ng HK kasi dun talaga ang aking trabaho,"" said Paredes.
(My wish is that there would be some kind of assistance, but my utmost wish is to really come back to Hong Kong because that is where my work is)
For ""Linda"", a Filipino expat based in Hong Kong for five years, the situation is already a double whammy. She said, if nothing changes in a week, she would be forced to stay in Manila and would need to spend a lot of her own money to buy equipment just to keep up with her work in Hong Kong from Manila. 
She is fortunate that she didn't end up going to the airport after receiving a cancellation email from Philippine Airlines.
""I work as a designer for the tourism industry. I've been working in Hong Kong for five years and my work has been impacted by the protests. So, I am anxious to do what I can for our ongoing projects even if business is shut down for now and everyone is working from home,"" said Linda.
The designer said they should have been allowed to travel outbound and been made to sign a waiver knowing the risks, for example, saying they understand how Filipino airplane staff are exposed to danger if flights continue, then give them the option of doing a transfer.
""Because other countries are still ok operating with the risk. We all have to make our choices for the life we ended up making,' said Linda. ""My life is not over but it's still painful and it's a terrible vulnerable feeling to be in a precarious situation where I am not given a choice. I worked really hard to be worthy of my job. I don't want to be in this situation where I am in danger of losing it,"" she added.
Mrs. Smith, a Filipino and Hong Kong resident who works for a furniture solutions company, said she and her British husband were supposed to fly out via Cathay Pacific on February 2 when they were told at the check in counter that she won't be able to fly with her husband because of the ban. 
She said she is lucky she is able to work from home, but if it takes longer than a few days, she'll be more concerned how she can get back to work.
""I find this very frustrating and extremely inconvenient. I feel this travel ban for outgoing Filipinos was careless and not thought out carefully,"" said Mrs. Smith. ""We should at least have a choice to sign a waiver that we choose to go back to where we reside despite the 'risks'.""

The situation was equally frustrating for ""Jane"", a Hong Kong-based regional marketing executive for a global company handling the Asia Pacific market. Jane was in Manila to spend her Chinese New Year holidays when she was among the hundreds who were also caught off guard by the President Duterte's announcement.
""They should have announced it and have a grace period so we wouldn't have had to go to the airport and process everything and we could have planned ahead,"" said Jane. 
""The immediate effectivity was to just cause chaos. I was in the airport for 10 hours. I'm just quite disappointed that no one is speaking on our behalf, on behalf of the OFWs and they're just basically...oh we'll give you P10,000. That won't solve it.""
What made matters worse was around 34 people, who were her co-passengers whom she had spoken with, were unable to locate their baggage after having spent 10 hours waiting at the airport. They were supposed to leave for Hong Kong at around 3pm on February 2 when they were also told their flight was cancelled.
They were told that their baggages had been sent to Hong Kong. She said Cebu Pacific personnel had asked them to leave their contact details and promised to update them as soon as their baggage arrived from Hong Kong.
In a text message to ABS-CBN News, Cebu Pacific Spokesperson Charo Logarta said that because of the confusion from the government's directives, some of the luggage were mistakenly not removed from the plane. She said that passengers would be getting back their baggage on February 4.
For another special administrative region affected, Macau-based hotel housekeeper Jayson Ocenar, an OFW there of four years, said his baby of 1 year and five months, along with his in-laws and relatives were supposed to stay with them for two months after arriving in Macau on January 12. 
But when things got worse in China, he decided to book their flight on February 2, but it got cancelled. He tried to rebook it on February 4, but got cancelled. 
He said they visited the Philippine Consulate in Macau on February 3 and met Filipinos with the same concern. He said some were tourists and visiting their families in Macau. He estimated that around 100 Filipinos were there, including children. And one Filipino had been given a visa extension for one month as the visa was supposed to expire yesterday. He said they have written a request letter for repatriation for the stranded tourists, which include his relatives.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based OFWs who are affected by the 2019 n-CoV travel ban with visas expiring soon or those who have been terminated, are encouraged to report to the Hong Kong immigration department about their status.
""There were instances that their flights are cancelled...ma-OS (overstay) sila. (Ang) Advice namin, they should go to immigration for extension of their visa and coordinate with their airline,"" said Assistant Labour Attache and Officer-In-Charge Antonio Villafuerte in a phone interview with ABS-CBN News on February 4.
""Ngayon, kung may problema po sa immigration, that's the time na punta sila ng Assistance to Nationals (sa Consulate) because it will become an immigration case already,"" he added.
Villafuerte said they are scheduled to meet with the Hong Kong Labor Department and the Immigration Department, together with the Philippine Consulate, on Tuesday (February 4) to discuss issues affecting Filipino workers over the current situation on affected Filipino workers in Hong Kong and those in the Philippines.
Filipinos with emergency concerns are advised to call the Consulate's hotline at +852 9155 4023. For matters concerning the Philippine Overseas Labor Office (POLO) and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), nationals are advised to call +852 5529 1880 and +852 6323 9324, respectively.

SEOUL - A South Korean woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand, South Korean officials said Tuesday, the first foreign tourist reported to have been infected after a visit to the southeast Asian nation.
The 42-year-old, identified only as Patient 16, flew back to South Korea on Jan. 19 after traveling in Thailand, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement.
Treated since developing chills and other symptoms from Jan. 25, she did not improve until Sunday, the KCDC added, and was confirmed positive on Tuesday, following checks at Chonnam National University Hospital.

MANILA (UPDATE) -- Roughly a fifth of 300 co-passengers of the Philippines' confirmed coronavirus cases have been contacted, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said Tuesday, as he accused airlines of failure to provide contact information. 
Only 17 percent of the passengers on board the Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific flights taken by the coronavirus patients in the country have been contacted, Duque told a Senate inquiry. 
Duque earlier said contact tracing was on ""full blast,"" but during the Senate hearing, he said his subordinates failed to inform him beforehand that only 17 percent of passengers have been contacted. 
""In all our meetings there has been no issue that this is a problem. This is an issue on the lack of transparency on the people on my part,"" he said. 
""'Yung mga ganung operational details, hindi nalalaman ng Secretary yan,"" he said, noting that his focus was on the ""big picture"" of the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
Duque said airlines invoked ""confidentiality"" when asked for the contact details of some of their passengers.
""Airlines are not sharing contact details of passengers. They are invoking confidentiality.""
“Ito ang kailangan nating harapin... Meron [list] pero no contact details, redacted,"" Duque said. 
In a separate statement to ABS-CBN News, Philippine Airlines spokesperson Cielo Villaluna said the flag carrier shared passengers' contact details. 
""We shared it to enable DOH to carry out the callouts and on top of that, PAL carried out callouts,"" Viillaluna said in a text message. 
In a statement, Cebu Pacific said it had already provided the DOH and the Bureau of Quarantine with a list of passengers aboard the questioned flights. 
The airline had also reached out to passengers aboard the flight taken by the coronavirus patient, Cebu Pacific director for Corporate Communications Corporate Affairs Charo Logarta Lagamon said. 
“There is no impediment whatsoever for CEB to provide any and all information that the BOQ nd DOH would need from us for their purposes,” she said. 
'SUPER SLOW'
Senator Ronald Dela Rosa described the Health department's contact tracing operations as ""super slow.""
""Once you have the list already, bigay niyo sa PNP. Tapos na yan in 3 days. Wag ninyo solohin ang problema,"" Dela Rosa said, referring to the Philippine National Police which he once headed.
Senator Francis Pangilinan said the ""dismally and incrediblly"" slow performance of the DOH showed a ""failure of leadership"" on Duque's part. 
""Seventeen percent is completely unacceptable at this day, 15 days after [the flight],"" the Pangilinan said.
""How when we stay on top of the situation when the fundamental information is not even in our fingertips?"" he said.
The government has been trying to monitor passengers who came in contact with a Chinese couple who tested positive for the novel coronavirus to curb to check if they are also carriers of the communicable virus.
The new coronavirus strain has killed 327 people and infected some 20,000 other globally since it was first reported in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.
Earlier this week, the Philippines banned travel to and from mainland China and its special administrative regions Hong Kong and Macau as health experts have yet to find a cure to the deadly virus.

Two Chinese from Wuhan, China are the only confirmed 2019-nCoV cases in the Philippines so far. One of them, a 44-year-old, died on Saturday due to severe pneumonia -- the first recorded nCoV death outside China.
Authorities are now tracing the people who may have been exposed to the couple, who arrived in Cebu from Hong Kong on Jan. 21 and who went to Dumaguete before flying to Manila. 
Both were admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital on Jan. 25.
The female companion became the first confirmed nCoV case in the country but is now asymptomatic, according to health authorities.
No cure nor vaccine has so far been developed to combat the virus.

BEIJING - Coronavirus patients arrived Tuesday at a Chinese field hospital built from scratch in under 2 weeks at the front-line of the outbreak, state media said, following a round-the-clock construction marathon that became a national social media sensation.
The 1,000-bed facility was built to relieve hospitals swamped with patients in Wuhan, the city in Hubei province at the epicenter of the national health emergency that has killed more in China than the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Fifty patients arrived at the military-run facility, the state-backed China Daily reported, with images showing workers in protective suits pushing people in wheelchairs up a ramp and into the pre-fabricated structure.
The virus has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000, nearly all of them in Hubei, and spread to 2 dozen countries since it emerged in December at a market that sold wild animals in the city.

China virus death toll rises to 425: gov't 

The World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency, and the first death outside China was confirmed in the Philippines on Sunday. 

First novel coronavirus death outside China recorded in PH - WHO official

As reports surfaced of bed shortages in hospitals in Wuhan, construction began on Huoshenshan -- ""Fire God Mountain"" in Chinese -- on Friday, Jan. 24. 
Workers toiled day and night amid a forest of earthmovers and trucks carting materials around the site, southwest of the center of the city of 11 million.
On the side of 1 of the trucks, the isolated city's new rallying cry -- ""Let's go Wuhan!""
FIRE, THUNDER
All workers wore masks, as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of Wuhan, and were checked for fevers during their breaks.
By the following Friday, they had laid 400 prefabricated shipping-container-like rooms, after setting concrete foundations and routing the power supply to the complex.
The 2-floor facility was handed over to the army on Sunday and will be staffed with 1,400 military medics, including some with experience dealing with SARS and Ebola.
State media had initially reported that patients would begin arriving Monday -- inside the 10-day time frame authorities had set out when construction began.
Leishenshan (""Thunder God Mountain""), another hospital on an adjacent site, is set to start admitting patients on Thursday, with 1,600 beds.
Fire and thunder are traditionally associated in China with protection against illnesses.
Authorities said the Wuhan facilities were modeled on the Xiaotangshan hospital in Beijing, which was built from prefabricated structures in barely a week to treat patients infected by SARS in 2003. 
That pathogen killed 349 people in China and hundreds more in Hong Kong and abroad.
However, with the death toll surging in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province, it was not immediately clear what overall impact the hospitals would have on the virus spreading elsewhere.
The city also plans to convert 3 existing venues, including a gymnasium and an exhibition center, into hospitals, the Wuhan government said.
The 3 buildings will be turned into healthcare facilities with a total of 3,400 beds to take in patients with mild symptoms.
 LIVESTREAMED
Footage of the mammoth construction effort was livestreamed continuously on social media and watched tens of millions of times.
It has also been feted endlessly in state media as an example of the decisive response to the public health crisis after authorities in Hubei faced a torrent of public anger for perceived incompetence, including delays in announcing the public health emergency.
Local Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang acknowledged Friday that officials had worsened the spread of the virus by failing to restrict travel earlier.
When a lockdown and blanket travel ban were finally introduced, they swept up more than 50 million people in Wuhan and nearby cities.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI - Police in China have detained a woman for ""deliberately concealing"" her contact with someone from an area stricken by the coronavirus and jeopardizing efforts to stop its spread, the Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday.
China has imposed sweeping measures to try to halt the virus including virtually locking down the central province of Hubei, where the virus emerged in December, and asking anyone who has visited there to isolate themselves for 14 days.
The death toll in China from the newly identified virus has risen to 425 with more than 20,000 cases of infection, authorities reported.

The detained woman, a 36-year-old identified by her surname, Liu, had hurt virus prevention and control work through her action and public security authorities in the northern municipality of Tianjin took her into custody for ""administrative detention.""
The state news agency gave no details of what she had done or say if or when she would be released.
Authorities in some places have threatened dire punishment for anyone violating the law in connection with efforts to battle the virus.
A high court in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang said people who intentionally spread the virus could face the death penalty, according to a Jan. 31 court notice.
Police in Qinghai province in the northwest were investigating a man infected with the virus who ""severely disrupted virus containment and harmed public health,"" Xinhua reported, without elaborating.

MAYNILA - Marami sa mga pasahero ng Light Rail Transit (LRT) Line 1 ang nakasuot ng face mask bilang proteksiyon sa gitna ng pangamba sa pagkalat ng 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
Saglit na ipinatatanggal ang face mask para makita ang mga mukha ng pasahero na parte ng seguridad sa LRT. 
Ayon kay Jacqueline Gorospe, corporate communications head ng Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC), ito ay kailangan at bahagi ng safety and security protocol ng LRT.
Maging ang mga guwardiya ng LRT ay nakasuot na rin ng face mask. May mga abiso na rin sa mga booth nito sa tamang pag-iingat kontra sa bagong coronavirus.
May mga ipinuwesto na ring bote ng alchohol sa mga ticketing booth ng LRT, pero dahil sa dami ng siniserbisyuhan nito araw-araw, mabilis itong maubos.

HONG KONG (2nd UPDATE) - Hong Kong reported its first coronavirus death on Tuesday, a 39-year-old male who had been suffering from an underlying illness and had visited China's Wuhan city in January, hospital staff said, marking the second death outside mainland China.
The first death outside of China was reported on Sunday - a 44-year-old Chinese man who died in the Philippines after traveling there from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus.

First novel coronavirus death outside China recorded in PH - WHO official

The death toll in China rose on Tuesday by a new daily record to more than 420 and total infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438. There were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain.

China virus death toll rises to 425: gov't

The Hong Kong death comes as hundreds of medical workers in the Asian financial hub began a second day of strikes on Tuesday to force the government to completely close the city's borders with mainland China, a day after embattled leader Carrie Lam left 3 remaining checkpoints open.
""As Carrie Lam refused to close the border, more (deaths) might come... We are not threatening the government, we just want to prevent the outbreak,"" said Cheng, a 26-year-old nurse attending the strike.
The latest coronavirus epidemic has rekindled memories of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 300 people in the city.
The former British colony so far has had 15 confirmed cases of the newly discovered coronavirus, including 1 that was transmitted locally.
The Hong Kong resident who died on Tuesday had been kept in an isolation ward after the coronavirus was confirmed last week. His 72-year-old mother, who contracted the virus locally and had no travel history, was staying at home during the incubation period, authorities said.
The United States, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and Vietnam are among countries that have denied entry to foreign nationals who have recently been in China.
Lam has rejected calls to shut the entire border, saying such a move would be ""inappropriate and impractical"" as well as ""discriminatory"".
On Monday, authorities announced the closure of 4 more border crossings with mainland China, leaving open the international airport, the bridge connecting the city to Macau and the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai as well as Shenzhen Bay Port in the north.
Around 2,700 workers from the newly formed Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) went on strike on Monday calling for a sealing off of Hong Kong's border and for better protection for hospital staff.

Holding red and white placards reading ""Save HK now. I am a Hospital Authority staff on strike,"" masked workers on Tuesday spilled out from inside the Authority's Kowloon located headquarters, and onto the main road outside.
Around 9,000 members out of the alliance's roughly 18,000 members are expected to join the strike on Tuesday, HAEA chairwoman Winnie Yu said. 
""Our demands are not something the Hospital Authority can solve so we urge Carrie Lam to negotiate with us directly,"" Yu said.
A spokesman for the city's hospital authority said that due to the large absence of medical staff in public hospitals today, some emergency services have been ""severely"" affected.
In a notice released on Monday, one of Hong Kong's voluntary ambulance brigades - St John Ambulance - announced they would suspend all first aid and ambulance duties due to the recent spread of the coronavirus.

MANILA - The Labor department on Monday directed concerned offices to extend cash and transport assistance as well as accommodations to overseas Filipino workers affected by travel bans due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III instructed Overseas Workers Welfare Administration's acting secretary Renato Ebarle to provide P10,000 cash assistance, accommodation and transport to stranded departing OFWs, OWWA said in a statement. 
The OWWA halfway house will serve as their shelter while travel arrangements back to the provinces are being made, Ebarle said. 
""The move will help ease the burden on would-be departing workers, and assist them in their transport back to their places of origin,"" Ebarle said in a memorandum.
Select countries and airports worldwide banned travel to and from parts of China to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel corona virus (nCov). 
Hundreds of OFWs bound for Hong Kong and Macau were stranded at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on Monday, following the travel ban imposed by President Rodrigo Duterte to prevent the spread of the 2019 novel corona virus (nCov) that originated in Wuhan, China.

FRANKFURT, Germany - Cruise lines worldwide will deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China, a global industry body said Monday, as fears grow over the deadly new coronavirus.
In a statement, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) said its members were taking extra precautions to prevent an outbreak of the virus on board cruise ships, where infections can spread rapidly.
""CLIA Members have suspended crew movements from mainland China and will deny boarding to any individual, whether guest or crew, who has travelled from or through mainland China within the previous 14 days,"" the body's Hamburg office said.
CLIA represents some of the world's largest and best-known cruise lines, including TUI, AIDA, MSC, Costa, Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruises.
The cruise companies were also carrying out careful screening of passengers and crew before boarding, and changing itineraries where necessary, CLIA said.
The industry body added that cruise ships were well equipped to deal with health emergencies.
""The cruise industry is one of the most well-equipped and experienced when it comes to managing and monitoring health conditions of passengers and crew,"" the statement said.
All ships are fitted with medical facilities and have medical professionals ""available around the clock"", it added.
The SARS-like virus that first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month has infected more than 17,000 people and killed over 360 so far.
It has spread to more than 24 countries, including Australia, Germany and Japan.
In a sign of growing anxiety, more than 6,000 tourists were temporarily confined to their cruise ship at an Italian port last week after two Chinese passengers fell ill.
They later tested negative for the coronavirus.

(UPDATE) Umabot na sa 80 ang itinuturing na persons under investigation (PUI) o mga taong binabantayan dahil sa bagong uri ng coronavirus, sabi ngayong Lunes ng Department of Health (DOH).
Sa press conference, sinabi ni Health Secretary Francisco Duque III na 67 sa mga PUI ay nasa ospital at naka-isolate habang 10 ang nakauwi na pero nasa ilalim ng strict monitoring. Iyong natitira ay iyong 2 kumpirmadong kaso habang ang isa ay iyong pumanaw pero nagnegatibo sa virus.
Sa 80, 30 ang nagnegatibo sa bagong strain ng coronavirus, 2 ang nagpositibo habang hinihintay pa ang resulta ng lab test ng 48, ayon kay Duque.

Ipinaliwanag ni Duque na ang biglaang pagtaas ng bilang ng PUI ay dahil sa mas maigting na surveillance ng kagawaran.
Nakumpirma noong Miyerkoles ang pinakaunang kaso ng 2019 coronavirus sa bansa, sa isang babaeng Chinese galing Wuhan, ang lungsod sa China na pinagmulan ng sakit.

PH naitala ang unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus

Iniulat naman ng DOH noong Linggo ang pagpanaw ng ikalawang kumpirmadong kaso — isang 44 anyos na lalaking Chinese na kasamahan ng unang pasyente.

Severe pneumonia o pulmonya ang sanhi ng pagkamatay ng lalaking pasyente.
Pero bukod sa novel coronavirus, ayon kay Duque, nagpositibo rin ang lalaki sa Streptococcus pneumoniae at Haemophilus influenza type B.
""We would say that the severe pneumonia must have been caused by the [novel coronavirus],"" ani Duque.
Ayon kay Edmundo Lopez, medical director ng San Lazaro Hospital, may mga hinihintay silang papeles at nakikipag-ugnayan na sa Chinese embassy bago i-cremate ang labi ng lalaki.
Labis pa rin ang pag-iingat sa pangangasiwa sa bangkay ng pasyente dahil baka makahawa pa rin ito.
CONTACT TRACING
Ayon naman kay Chito Avelino, direktor ng DOH Epidemiology Bureau, 74 na tao na ang kanilang na-contact sa contact tracing ng mga posibleng nakasalamuha ng 2 Chinese na nagpositibo sa novel coronavirus.
Ang ilan daw sa mga ito ay nakitaan ng mga sintomas ng flu o trangkaso.
""They were given advice on home quarantine. This will involve isolation inside their house. They are not allowed to interact with their families,"" ani Avelino.
PULISYA TUTULONG SA LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
Inatasan naman ng Department of the Interior and Local Government ang Philippine National Police na tulungan ang mga pamahalaang lokal sakaling ayaw magpa-check up ng isang pinaghihinalaang may novel coronavirus.
Sakop din ng direktiba ang pag-check sa mga condominium unit na may mga residenteng Chinese national.
Nagpahayag naman ng kahandaan ang disaster at health officials ng mga pamahalaang lokal sa Metro Manila.
Ang mga local government ng Pasig, Parañaque at Quezon City ay nagtayo na ng isolation tent para sa mga posibleng kaso ng bagong coronavirus.
Paulit-ulit namang paalala ng mga awtoridad na iwasan ang pagpapakalat ng mga hindi kumpirmadong impormasyon kaugnay ng novel coronavirus, at sa DOH at mga local government na lang makinig.
Ang 2019 novel coronavirus ang pinakabagong strain mula sa pamilya ng mga virus na nagdudulot ng impeksiyon at sakit sa paghinga.
Bukod sa China at iba pang bahagi ng Asya, kumalat na rin ang sakit sa ibang malalayong bansa gaya ng Australia, Germany, France, Finland.

MAYNILA — Sa gitna ng mga pangamba sa bagong uri ng coronavirus, iginiit ng isang doktor na hindi naman kailangan laging magsuot ng publiko ng face mask. 
Ang face mask ay nagsisilbing proteksiyon ng isang tao para hindi mahawa sa sakit ng iba o para hindi makahawa ng iba sakaling siya ang may sakit, ayon sa infectious disease specialist na si Rey Salinel.

Pero mainam lang umano ang paggamit ng face mask kapag pumupunta ang isang tao sa mga masisikip at matataong lugar.
“Doon (congested areas) ka may reason para mag-face mask ka, sa palengke, LRT, MRT, jeep, eroplano. Pero kung walang senyales na kayo ay may ubo, sipon, trangkaso, puwede na kayong hindi mag-face mask,” sabi ni Salinel sa panayam ng “Salamat Dok.”
Bukod sa pagsusuot ng face mask, binigyang-diin din ni Salinel ang paghuhugas ng kamay at pagpapanatili ng malinis na katawan para makaiwas sa novel coronavirus at iba pang mga sakit.

Mga face mask sa Pilipinas, nagkakaubusan dahil sa banta ng 2019-nCoV

Nauna na ring sinabi ng mga health official na sa mga piling pagkakataon lang dapat magsuot ng face mask.
Umapela rin si Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo sa publiko na huwag ubusin ang stock ng N95 face mask dahil mas kailangan ito ng mga health worker na nakatutuok sa paggamot sa mga kumpirmadong kaso ng at hinihinalang may novel coronavirus.

Isang 44 anyos na lalaking Chinese, ang pangalawang kumpirmadong kaso ng 2019 Novel Coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) sa Pilipinas, ang pumanaw noong Sabado, ayon kay Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
""This is the first reported death outside China,"" ani Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO representative sa Pilipinas, sa isang conference kasama si Duque.
Ang nasabing lalaki ay kasamahan ng 38 anyos na babaeng Chinese na unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus sa bansa.

PH naitala ang unang kaso ng bagong coronavirus

Na-admit sa isang government hospital sa Maynila ang dalawang pasyente noong Enero 25, ayon kay Duque. Nakaranas ng pulmonya, lagnat, ubo, at pamamaga ng lalamunan ang lalaki.
""Over the course of the patient's admission, he developed severe pneumonia,"" ani Duque.
""In his last few days, the patient was stable and showed signs of improvement. However, the condition of the patient deteriorated within the last 24 hours, resulting in his demise,"" dagdag ng kalihim.
Asymptomatic naman ang babaeng pasyente o wala nang pinapakitang sintomas ng virus.
Nagpaalala naman si Abeyasinghe na hindi ""locally acquired"" ang sakit ng lalaki kundi nakuha niya mismo sa Wuhan, na sinasabing pinagmulan ng virus.
""This patient came from the epicenter of this outbreak, Wuhan, China, where there have been very large number of deaths,"" sabi naman ni Abeyasinghe.
Sinabi naman ng Cebu Paficic na nakikipagtulungan sila sa Bureau of Quarantine at National Epidemiology Center para kontakin ang lahat ng mga pasaherong nakasabay ng 2 Chinese national na nagpositibo sa novel coronavirus sa Pilipinas.
Inanunsiyo rin ng Department of Health at Research Institute for Tropical Medicine na 23 patients under investigation (PUI) ang nag-negatibo sa novel coornavirus.
Hinihintay pa ang resulta ng confirmatory test ng apat na PUI.
TRAVEL BAN
Samantala, pinalawig na ng gobyerno ang ban o pagbabawal sa mga biyaherong galing China bilang pag-iingat sa bagong coronavirus.

Bago nito, mga biyahero galing Hubei — ang Chinese province na nakakasakop sa Wuhan — lamang ang naka-ban.
Pero ngayon, inutos ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte na isama sa ban ang lahat ng mga biyahero galing China, Hong Kong, at Macau, ayon kay Sen. Bong Go, chairperson ng Senate Committee on Health and Demography.
""The order covers all travelers from China to the Philippines, regardless of nationality,"" sabi ni Go sa radyo DZMM.
Kailangan namang sumailalim sa 14-day quarantine ang mga uuwing Filipino citizen at iyong mga may permanent resident visa, ayon kay Go, ang dating aide ni Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte.
Inabisuhan naman ni Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal ang mga pasahero na may nakatakdang flights papunta at galing China na tingnan ang mga airline website para sa mga advisory at update.
Inabisuhan na rin ng Department of Tourism ang kanilang mga opisina sa China na tiyaking susunod ang lahat sa utos na travel ban.
Pumalo na sa 304 ang bilang ng mga namatay na nahawahan ng novel coronavirus sa China. May 13,700 naman ang bilang ng mga kumpirmadong kaso.

Thousands of Hong Kong medical workers voted Saturday to strike as they urge the government to close its border with the mainland to contain the coronavirus epidemic that has killed 259 people.
The financial hub has 13 confirmed cases of the disease as of Saturday, with 112 patients isolated. 
More than three thousand public hospital staff including doctors and nurses voted to strike if the government fails to meet their demands
""If we do not curb the source (of the virus), the resources of epidemic prevention and manpower will never be enough,"" said Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA).
""We don't want to go on strike, but the government has been ignoring the demands of the frontline medical workers. We have no choice,"" Yu added.
The HAEA will meet with representatives from their employer -- the city's hospital authority -- on Sunday to negotiate.
The newly formed alliance said 9,000 of its members back the strike, making up 10 percent of the workforce of the city's workforce.
If no deal is reached, around 30 percent of the 9,000 -- those who work in non-essential positions -- would first go on strike next Monday. The rest, who provide emergency services, would afterwards join a four-day strike.
Hong Kong's hospital authority on Saturday said it would come up with a contingency plan.
The city's pro-Beijing administration has resisted public pressure to completely close its border although it has slashed several lesser-used crossings, with the city's chief executive saying on Friday a full closure is not feasible.
The United States has temporarily barred entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks and Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China.
Italy, Singapore and Mongolia have also taken similar sweeping precautions.

MANILA—Adamson University on Saturday apologized after it received backlash for ordering all its Chinese students to quarantine themselves amid the new coronavirus outbreak.
The school earlier released an advisory, requiring Chinese students, both graduate and undergraduate, to observe a 2-week self-quarantine ""to ensure a healthy and virus-free environment.""
It also urged Chinese nationals ""to postpone all transactions inside the university until Feb. 14, 2020.""

 
""We apologized for the misimpression it may have created,"" said the university, which has revised the advisory, expanding the scope of those who should be covered by the order.
""All students, staff and stakeholders who have traveled to and from countries with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, including China and/or Hong Kong, within the last month, or who may have in close contact or had direct exposure to a potential source of infection during their travel abroad,"" part of the memorandum read.
Chinese students and guests who are not limited by the above conditions, Adamson said, are allowed to come to school.

HANOI - Vietnam has suspended all China flights as part of ""strengthening measures"" against the coronavirus outbreak, its civil aviation authority said in a statement on Saturday.
The directive applies to all airlines ""which have routes between Vietnam and China"" and is effective from Saturday, it added.
Vietnam Airlines, the country's national carrier, and budget airline Jetstar Pacific said they would stop flying to mainland China along with Hong Kong and Taiwan.
An AFP correspondent on a flight from Taiwan to Vietnam was among 98 passengers told to disembark just as the announcement went public.
""The decision is ridiculous and unacceptable,"" Vietnamese tourist Doan Thi Ngoc Diep told AFP after leaving the plane.
Vietnam is the latest country to impose extraordinary travel barriers after the virus spread to two dozen nations and killed 259 people in China where it originated in the city of Wuhan.
The United States temporarily barred entry to foreigners who had been in China within the past two weeks and Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China.
Italy, Singapore and Mongolia have also taken similar sweeping precautions.
The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday but did not advise international trade of travel restrictions.
Vietnam's announcement came after the country confirmed its sixth case of the coronavirus.
A 25-year-old hotel receptionist working in Nha Trang contracted the SARS-like pathogen after coming into contact with Chinese tourists who were later diagnosed with coronavirus.
She was also the first domestic infection for a Vietnamese national with no known history of travel to China.
Three of the country's six cases were Vietnamese nationals who had traveled to Wuhan.
The receptionist's health is ""stable, no fever or cough"", a hospital staffer told AFP on condition of anonymity, adding she had ""no history of travel to China recently"".
Vietnam has joined Thailand, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, France and the United States as the only countries with confirmed domestic coronavirus infections.

SHANGHAI - Apple Inc on Saturday said it would shut all of its official stores and corporate offices in mainland China until Feb 9. as fears over the coronavirus outbreak mounted and the death toll more than doubled to over 250 from a week ago.
""Out of an abundance of caution and based on the latest advice from leading health experts, we're closing all our corporate offices, stores, and contact centers in mainland China through February 9,"" Apple said in a statement. 
The company said it looked forward to re-opening stores ""as soon as possible.""
Earlier this week, Apple closed 3 stores in China due to concerns about the spread of the virus.
It is joining a handful of overseas retailers, including Starbucks Corp and McDonald's Corp, in temporarily shutting storefronts as a precautionary measure.

Many other companies, meanwhile, have called for employees in China to work from home and cease non-essential business travel in the first week of February.
Normally, businesses in China would be preparing to return to normal operations following the end of the week-long Lunar New Year Holiday.
Apple remains heavily reliant on China both for smartphone sales as well as for its supply chain and manufacturing. Many factories in Hubei province, including plants run by AB InBev and General Motors Co, have temporarily suspended production due to the virus.
In a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working out mitigation plans to deal with possible production loss from its suppliers in Wuhan. The city where the virus outbreak originated is home to several Apple suppliers.

SYDNEY - The Australian government on Saturday said it would bar non-citizens arriving from China from entering the country under new measures to combat the spread of the new coronavirus epidemic.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said only ""Australian citizens, Australian residents, dependents, legal guardians or spouses"" would be permitted into the country from China from Saturday.
""The arrangements are being put in place through our border authorities to ensure that that can be actioned,"" he added. ""Those that do return will be required to go into self isolation for 14 days.""
Australia's foreign ministry also updated its travel advice for China to ""do not travel.""
As of Saturday, more than 250 people have died and some 12,000 have been infected of the virus, which originated in Wuhan, a city in eastern China.

PHUKET, Thailand - The narrow laneways and pastel-colored shophouses of Phuket Old Town are usually bustling with Chinese tourists during the Lunar New Year holiday, but travel bans and local fears about coronavirus have largely emptied the streets this year.
Just a handful of tourists, many wearing face masks, strolled through the area during daylight hours this week. In the evening, foot traffic increased a little under the glow of the red lanterns strung across the thoroughfare, but remained far below normal levels.
""The impact is tremendous,"" 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul told Reuters as she waited behind the counter for shoppers in her store selling postcards, straw bags, clothing and jewelry.
""Only a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few,"" Akaradachakul said. ""I think about 70 percent of them are gone.""
The beach resort of Phuket is Thailand's second most visited destination after Bangkok and is usually a big draw for visitors from China, who accounted for 11 million visitors last year, particularly around the Lunar New Year holiday.
But China this week imposed restrictions on all overseas tour groups because of the coronavirus that originated in the city of Wuhan and which has infected more than 11,000 people and killed more than 250.

China virus death toll rises to 259, infections surge 

Reduced travel from China alone could result in 50 billion baht ($1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the Thai Tourism Ministry estimated.
The spread of coronavirus beyond China has also affected domestic tourism in Thailand, which has recorded more infections than anywhere but China with 19 cases. Thailand announced its first case of human-to-human transmission on Friday.
Shopkeepers in Phuket said that had left Thai tourists wary of venturing out to join what should have been an annual festival on Walking Street at the heart of the town.
""There are barely any tourists around here. The people we are seeing now are just the locals,"" clothes store vendor Parichart Chaengmanee told Reuters as she sat on a stool outside her empty clothing stall, wearing a black face mask. ""Even the number of Thai tourists is low.""

MANILA (UPDATE) - Communications Secretary Martin Andanar on Saturday called on the public to remain calm and avoid discriminating against anyone amid the rapid spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.
""As the issue of a viral outbreak affects everyone, let us not engage in discriminatory behavior, nor act with any bias towards our fellowmen. The reality is everyone is susceptible to the virus,"" he said in a statement.
Andanar called on Filipinos to empathize with those at their most vulnerable, instead of stigmatizing them.
""We should not let fear turn us against one another, especially if these fears are unfounded,"" he said, adding that the Philippine government is working with foreign authorities to contain the outbreak.
The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus - a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China, epicenter of the respiratory contagion, who arrived in the Philippines on Jan. 21.
Philippine health authorities also continue to monitor 31 people suspected of carrying the strain, wherein 25 of them are admitted in hospitals around the country.

On Friday, Malacañang announced the Philippines would bar travelers from Hubei province in China, where Wuhan is located. Several confirmed cases have been reported across the province, where expanding lockdowns are being enforced by Chinese authorities. 
As of Saturday, some 259 people have died of the acute respiratory disease in China, while nearly 12,000 have been infected.

Amid stricter port controls in the Philippines and public vigilance against sickness, some members of the Filipino-Chinese community have expressed lament at how the health scare has fueled xenophobia towards the Chinese. 
“It’s very sad. Instead that we stand as one against this virus, it's becoming divisive,” anti-crime crusader and Chinese-Filipino figure Teresita Ang-See told ABS-CBN News on Friday.
She added: ""There should be no division between the Tsinoy from new immigrants and old immigrants.""

FILIPINO-CHINESE TRADERS CAUTION VS XENOPHOBIA
The Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc (FFCCCII) president Henry Lim Bon Liong also urged the public to avoid expressing outright anti-Chinese sentiment.
""Spreading fake news and racist, xenophobic messages can be more dangerous than the virus itself due to their negative effects of causing confusion, fears, rancor and instability,"" he said in a statement released Friday.
China is the Philippines' traditional ally and long-standing trade partner, Liong said.
""Instead of racist attacks by some quarters, we should commend the China government’s transparency, for their remarkable political will and their immense sacrifices of imposing a lockdown on Wuhan City and its neighbors which involve millions of people,"" he added.
Andanar, meanwhile, appealed to the public not to hoard face masks, saying this ""creates unnecessary scarcity"" and that the limited supply should be reserved for health workers. 
""Let us not resort to panic, sow fear-mongering or spread misinformation. Solidarity, empathy, and cooperation are what we need to successfully take actions that will overcome this health concern,"" Andanar said.

WASHINGTON - While insisting the risk to Americans from coronavirus is low, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency on Friday and announced the extraordinary step of barring entry to the United States of foreign nationals who have recently visited China.

US declares virus 'emergency,' bans travelers from China

In addition, US citizens who have traveled within the past 2 weeks to China's Hubei Province - epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic - will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of 14 days, the incubation period of the virus, officials said.
Americans who visited other parts of mainland China will undergo special health screening upon their return, followed by up to 14 days of ""monitored self-quarantine"" under the temporary restrictions.
The emergency measures were unveiled by US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a White House briefing, shortly before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health authorities announced that a seventh US coronavirus case had been confirmed in Northern California.

WHO declares global emergency as 2019-nCoV spreads quickly 

The latest US patient was identified only as a man in Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, who became ill after traveling to China and has ""self-isolated"" at home, Sara Cody, director of public health for the county, told reporters.
She said the CDC was seeking to determine whether the man was infectious while flying home.
The US entry ban on foreign travelers to China and the quarantine for Americans returning from Hubei go into effect on Sunday at 5 p.m. EST (6 a.m. Sunday in Manila), Azar said.
At the same time all commercial flights from China would be restricted to international US airports in 1 of 7 cities - New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Honolulu.
KEEPING RISK LOW
CDC Director Robert Redfield told reporters the US government acted after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency on Thursday over the spread of the respiratory disease.
""I want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize that the risk to the American public is currently low,"" Redfield said. ""Our goal is to do all we can do to keep it that way.""
The US State Department warned Americans on Thursday not to travel to China because of the epidemic.
The ban on US entry of foreign nationals who have traveled to China during the past 14 days would exempt immediate family of US citizens and permanent US residents, Azar said. It was not immediately clear how long the ban would be in effect.

China's Hubei reports 45 new coronavirus deaths, total at 249 

The flu-like coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, and was first identified earlier this month, has resulted in 259 deaths in China.
More than 11,700 people have been infected in China, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.
None of the US cases has been fatal, and all but one of the patients in the United States was believed to have contracted the disease while they were traveling in the Wuhan area of China.
FIRST US QUARANTINES
The first quarantines of US citizens potentially exposed to coronavirus in China began hours before the White House announcement.
Nearly 200 Americans evacuated earlier this week from Wuhan and voluntarily confined to a California military air base for 72 hours of health screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday. It marked the CDC's first quarantine order in 50 years.
The State Department said Friday it was working with Chinese agencies to arrange additional flights of Americans out of Wuhan. Washington also plans to evacuate non-essential government employees and family members from the US Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday.
The 2-week quarantine of the 195 Americans at March Air Reserve Base, near Los Angeles, runs from the time the evacuees left China on Tuesday.
The original plan was to release the passengers after 72 hours of evaluation and tests, absent any indication of illness, and permit them to take public transportation home. Local health authorities would then continue monitoring the evacuees through the remainder of the incubation period.

US evacuees from China placed on 72-hour 'hold' at California military base for medical evaluation 

CDC officials said then that such a plan posed little or no risk of spreading the virus because individuals incubating the infection before symptoms appear are generally not contagious.
But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Friday that experts' understanding of the virus was still evolving.
She cited emerging evidence the virus can be spread by someone who is infected but not yet showing signs of being ill, such as fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms.
The CDC also pointed to a limitation of its screening test for the virus - a negative result is merely a ""point-in-time"" snapshot that cannot conclusively rule out the risk of a person developing the disease during the 14-day incubation period.
The blanket quarantine at March air base was instituted after 1 passenger sought to leave the base without permission on Wednesday night, and was immediately slapped with an individual quarantine order by local health officials.
As of Thursday, none of the group at the base had exhibited signs of the disease, local health officials said.

BEIJING - The death toll from China's new coronavirus outbreak has risen to 259 and the tally of confirmed infections has surged to nearly 12,000, the government said on Saturday.
The National Health Commission said in its daily update that 46 more people had succumbed to the respiratory disease.
All but one of the new deaths came in hardest-hit Hubei province, the epicenter of an outbreak that has spread around the world. 
The virus emerged in December in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, and has been traced to a meat market that sold wild game.
The number of infections in China also rose by 2,102, bringing the nationwide total to 11,791.
That's despite unprecedented quarantine measures imposed last week on millions of people in Hubei and aggressive preventive steps elsewhere in the country.
The number of new deaths and newly confirmed cases have both spiraled higher on a daily basis since China sounded the nationwide alarm a week ago.
The epidemic has spread far and wide as huge numbers of Chinese traveled within and outside the country for the Lunar New Year holiday that started last week.
It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than 2 dozen countries.
The top Communist Party official in Wuhan expressed ""remorse"" on Friday, saying local authorities acted too slowly in containing the virus.

2020-01-31,nCov,"Chinese-Filipinos lament racism, call for unity as new coronavirus spreads","Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News","
MANILA — With most of the new coronavirus cases coming from China, attention has again focused on the influx of Chinese tourists and workers in the Philippines.
Even in other countries where the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease (2019-nCoV ARD) has spread, media has reported a rising anti-Chinese sentiment and even racism. For instance, there have been reports of children of Chinese descent being bullied by schoolmates in the United States and Europe.

READ: Anti-Chinese sentiment brews as world contains new coronavirus

In the Philippines, this has prompted younger members of the Chinese-Filipino community to post about how they are different from the new Chinese arrivals.
One circulating message mentions not only the fact that they were born and raised in the Philippines, but also how they do not eat exotic animals like bats and snakes -- two of the animals being investigated as the source of the new strain of coronavirus, which has killed at least 200 people.
Anti-crime crusader and Chinese-Filipino figure Teresita Ang-See told ABS-CBN News on Friday that she is saddened by how some younger members of their community and Filipinos in general have resorted to distancing themselves from the Chinese on the basis of race.
“It’s very sad. I feel so sad na imbes na sa panahong ito (that instead at this time) we stand as one against this fight, this virus, nagiging divise tuloy (it's becoming divisive),” she said.
“Hindi naman dapat na magkaroon ng division ang Tsinoy sa new immigrants and old immigrants.”
(There should be no division between the Tsinoy from new immigrants and old immigrants.)
The Philippines has seen an influx of Chinese arrivals, with improving ties between Manila and Beijing giving way to more Chinese investments in the country, particularly in offshore gaming, and greater inbound tourism.
Ang-See said Filipinos should respond in a way that is befitting a Christian country.
“Why is this happening? It’s narrow-minded thinking at a time of crisis,” she said in Filipino.
Ang-See was at the Manila City Hall on Friday with her group Kaisa Para sa Kaunlaran and another group the Filipino Chinese Amity Club to turn over 4,000 face masks to Manila Mayor Isko Moreno. On Friday morning, they also handed over 2,000 face masks to the Intramuros Administration.

— Kristine Sabillo (@kristinesabillo) January 31, 2020

Ang-See said they decided to donate the face masks to help prevent the spread of the new strain of coronavirus and to support public servants, especially traffic enforcers who also need face masks to protect themselves against pollution.
But she said people should practice proper hygiene as face masks are not enough to protect them.
Ang-See said there are also other Chinese-Filipinos giving out face masks in the Ongpin area in Manila.
This coincides with social media posts of Chinese nationals who were seen distributing free face masks in Makati.
BORDERLESS
Ang-See said people should remember that the virus “knows no boundaries.”
“During these times, we can’t have a you-against-me attitude,” she explained. “We are lucky because the virus did not originate from our country.”
The fast-spreading 2019-nCoV originated from Wuhan, capital of the eastern Chinese province of Hubei, and has killed more than 200 people and infected at least 10,000 as of Friday.
The disease, which manifests as fever, cough and difficulty breathing, has reached beyond Chinese borders, with confirmed cases in other parts of Asia, North America and Europe.
On Thursday, the Philippines confirmed its first case- a Chinese woman from Wuhan who arrived in the country on Jan. 21. She is now asymptomatic yet still confined at an undisclosed Metro Manila hospital.

Philippines confirms first case of new coronavirus

Malacañang on Friday announced a ban on travelers coming from Hubei province, while other countries have completely shut out those coming from all of mainland China.
A RECURRING PROBLEM
Ang-See said there were also instances of racism when the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) spread globally almost a decade ago.
“We haven’t learned from our experiences that viruses have nothing to do with race,” she said.
Newspaper columnist Wilson Lee Flores said: “The recent coronavirus problem seems to have brought out some unspoken misunderstandings, age-old negative stereotypes or some latent anti-Chinese racism in our society and even in other parts of the world.”
The 7th generation ethnic Chinese, who has lived in the Philippines his whole life, called it “unfortunate” and said it goes against the country’s democracy “which protects the equal rights and dignity of all people regardless of ethnic, religious or socio-economic background.”
He said the old stereotypes against the Chinese could be attributed to the Spanish colonial era.
He said that while Filipinos were also victims of discrimination by Spaniards, the colonizers “committed double or triple discriminations against the Muslim or Moro and Chinese minorities based on race, different religion and also fears of Chinese entrepreneurial success.”
VIRUS OF RACISM
“Racism doesn't only victimize certain minorities or communities in our society, it morally diminishes all of us, it threatens social peace, national unity and national progress,” the columnist said.
He said the only positive thing that can be said now is that racism “can be recognized as a real social problem that needs to be condemned as evil (and) that the phenomenon of social media has magnified and amplified this virus of racism which we should fight to stop.”
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo also said the issue of racism should be addressed, adding that he has heard of how some Chinese-Filipinos now make sure to speak in Filipino in public so people won’t avoid them.
“What we are avoiding is an illness. It’s a virus. It can affect anybody,” he said.
“At this time, unfortunately, cases are coming mostly from China. But since last week there are no more flights from Wuhan and now we have a total ban,” Domingo pointed out.
“I hope we can all just work together. Bullying and being judgmental won’t help us,” he said.

PANGLAO, Bohol—Alona Beach here used to be packed with tourists, but amid fears of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) this popular travel destination is nearly deserted.
Visitors of this white-sand public beach that boasts crystal-clear waters know that, even on weekdays, Alona is usually filled with holidaymakers both local and international. Today is different, though, because the threat of being sick looms.
""We are very affected because there are no group tours anymore,"" said James Cumba, who offers island-hopping services.
He said his business has suffered because of travel cancellations, including from China, where the new coronavirus originated.
Eriko, a Japanese citizen who has been working as a local dive instructor for more than 15 years, said this is her first time to experience such a drop in the number of dive students.
""This is worse than the SARS outbreak,"" she said.
The local government (LGU) of Bohol acknowledged that the tourism industry is struggling.
Bohol, which is putting public-health measures in place, is now thinking of temporarily banning arrivals of Chinese tourists in the province until the 2019-nCoV outbreak ends.
""There is a big implication with the ban, but we are studying it. One thing is for sure, we are not a main gateway,"" said Bohol acting governor Rene Relampagos.
The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached more than 200 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in an outbreak that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
The death toll in Hubei province -- the virus' epicenter -- has risen to 204 and there were nearly 9,700 cases of infection nationally as of Thursday, Chinese health authorities said. About 100 cases have been reported in at least 18 other countries, with no deaths outside China.

BEIJING - China sent two planes to Malaysia and Thailand on Friday to bring ""stranded"" Hubei province residents back to the virus-stricken city of Wuhan, authorities said.
The Xiamen Airlines flights will pick up the Chinese nationals from Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia and the Thai capital Bangkok, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
There are 117 nationals from Hubei province in Bangkok and 100 in Kota Kinabalu who are ""willing to take the chartered flights back to Wuhan as soon as possible"", the CAAC said in a statement.
This is in spite of the fact that Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, is the epicenter of a new virus outbreak that is believed to have originated in a market that sold wild animals.
The city of 11 million has since experienced an unprecedented lockdown, preventing residents from leaving in a bid to stop the deadly virus from spreading further.
The charter flights are expected to arrive in Wuhan at 1200 and 1300 GMT on the same day.
""The charter flights adopt the principle of voluntary ticket purchase,"" the CAAC added.
China's foreign affairs ministry said earlier on Friday that the country would bring Wuhan residents back from overseas ""as soon as possible"" due to the ""the practical difficulties that Chinese citizens from Hubei, especially Wuhan, have faced overseas"".
This comes after a number of airlines announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country struggles to contain the spread of a deadly new virus.
On Monday, Malaysia banned visitors from Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province as well.
The topic was trending online on Friday, with over 67 million views and 21,000 discussion posts on China's Twitter-like platform Weibo.
""These people probably don't want to go back (to Wuhan),"" said one.
Another questioned if residents should be brought back if they were not infected.
When asked about the suspension of international flights at a press conference on Thursday, Zhu Tao of the CAAC said authorities were coordinating arrangements to bring travelers home.
Hospitals have been overwhelmed in Wuhan. AFP reporters saw long queues, with some patients saying they lined up for two days to see a doctor.
As fears of the outbreak have spread overseas, prominent figures in Chinese communities in Italy have warned of episodes of ""latent racism"" against their compatriots by Italians fearful of catching the virus.
China has advised its citizens to postpone trips abroad and cancelled overseas group tours, while several countries including the United States, Germany, Britain and Japan have urged their citizens to avoid travel to China.

MANILA - The Presidential Security Group recommended Friday the “indefinite” suspension of museum tours in Malacañang as the country confirmed its first case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease.
All PSG personnel on duty at the Malacañang Complex will also be required to wear face masks as a precautionary measure against the spread of the virus, their commander, Brig. Gen. Jose Niembra said.
“This is a preemptive measure to ensure that the seat of government is secured from this biological threat,” Niembra said.
The recommendation will be submitted to the Palace’s Internal House Affairs Office for approval.
Tours in the Presidential Museum and Library in Malacañang are free but subject to the approval of the PSG.
The PSG recommendation came a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of the virus—a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, where the pathogen is believed to have originated.

Singapore on Friday announced a sweeping ban on arrivals from mainland China as authorities toughened measures to prevent the spread of the fast-spreading 2019 Novel Coronavirus. 
The move was a dramatic expansion of earlier measures that affected only arrivals from central Hubei province and came after the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus an international emergency.

""We are also concerned about your people in China. I know you have nationals in China. We can assure that they will have the best treatment and best care from authorities concerned,"" Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian told reporters in a press briefing.
""We believe China and the Philippines [have] come through thick and thin. We will continue to go hand in hand to overcome the difficulties and we are very confident to bring our people back on track at an early date,"" he said.

The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached 213 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in an outbreak that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.
The death toll in Hubei province -- where Wuhan is -- had risen to 204 and there were 9,692 cases of infection nationally as of Thursday, Chinese health authorities said. About 100 cases have been reported in at least 18 other countries, with no deaths outside China.
Duterte on Friday ordered a ban on travelers coming from Hubei, where Chinese authorities have enforced expanding lockdown measures in a bid to contain the virus.

MANILA - A group of Filipino-Chinese businessmen in the Philippines will donate over a half-million face masks to the public, China's envoy said Friday, a day after health officials confirmed the Manila's first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov).
Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said that upon his suggestion, at least 600,000 masks will be donated by the Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Inc.
""We believe China and the Philippines [have] come through thick and thin. We will continue to go hand in hand to overcome the difficulties and we are very confident to bring our people back on track [at] an early date,"" Huang told reporters Friday.
Demand for face masks spiked amid fears of the spread of the new coronavirus, which has left 200 people dead in China. The World Health Organization has declared a global emergency with 10,000 reported cases in 18 countries.
The Department of Health (DOH) earlier called on the public to stop hoarding face masks, emphasizing that a shortage of supply will affect health workers and other people who need it most.

MANILA - Malacañang should designate a lone spokesperson -preferably Health Secretary Francisco Duque III - for updates on 2019 Novel Coronavirus response and monitoring in the Philippines to prevent ""an epidemic of fake news and misinformation,"" a lawmaker said Friday.
In a statement, Sen. Nancy Binay said having too many government officials and those outside government releasing announcements and position papers on the communicable disease breeds ""public confusion.""
""Ang nakalulungkot, we are also battling an epidemic of fake news and misinformation, tapos kung sinu-sino lamang na di naman bihasa sa public health o may sapat na kaalaman sa sitwasyon patungkol sa n-CoV ang nagsasalita para sa DOH o sa presidente,"" she said.

She said confusion and misinformation about the new coronavirus strain stems from government officials who have been airing announcements without proper coordination with the Department of Health or even Malacañang, the senator said.
""'Wag muna paepal 'yung iba diyan (These people should not be hogging the scene) because they do not represent the views of doctors or public health specialists,"" she said, without naming who she was referring to.
""Huwag na nating dagdagan pa ang kaguluhan sa Pilipinas. Public health ang nakasalalay dito,"" she said.
SEPARATE HEALTH ANNOUNCEMENT BODY
Sen. Francis Tolentino earlier filed a bill seeking to create a separate DOH office for health announcements.
The proposed ""Office of the Surgeon General"" will serve ""as the national spokesperson on all matters relating to public health in the country, particularly on dangerous diseases, infections and other hazardous conditions affecting the populace,"" Tolentino's Senate Bill No. 1288 read.
Health officials earlier urged the public to avoid spreading misleading information about the respiratory disease that has left at least 200 people dead and nearly 10,000 others infected across China, where the virus began, other parts of Asia, Europe and North America.

MAYNILA - Ngayong naitala na ang unang kaso ng 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) sa bansa, nagbigay ng tips ang isang primary care doctor sa pagpapatibay ng resistensiya para makontra ang sakit.
Payo ni Gerald Belandres, kumpletuhin ang oras ng tulog para mapabuti ang resistensya. 
Kung maaari aniya, huwag magpuyat.
""Dapat complete ang tulog natin and enough rest. Hindi lang resistensiya [mapapabuti kundi] red blood cells,"" ani Belandres sa programang ""Good Vibes"" ng DZMM. 
Dagdag pa niya, dapat gumamit ng hand sanitizers at alcohol para mawala ang bacteria sa kamay. 
Nakakatulong din aniya kung iiwasan ang stress. 
Paliwanag niya: ""Once na masaya ka positive energy mas malakas din ang resistensiya mo."" 
Para kay Belandres, hindi sapat ang pagsuot ng mga face mask para maiwasan ang sakit. 
""Ang mask kasi puwedeng protection... Pero kung mahina ang resistensiya mo mahahawa ka at mahahawa ka pa rin,"" ani Belandres. 
At kung may mga sintomas na ng bagong coronavirus gaya ng ubo, sipon, at hirap huminga, magpasya nang i-isolate ang sarili.

MANILA - Baguio City has canceled the opening parade of the Panagbenga Festival over the weekend, its mayor said Friday, a day after the Philippines confirmed its first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus acute respiratory disease.
The month-long Panagbenga Festival usually draws in thousands of tourists to the streets of Baguio as it celebrates the ""season of blooming.""
""After due deliberation, I am canceling the Panagbenga street parade tomorrow,"" Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong said in a press conference.
The Cordillera Regional Athletic Association (CARAA) added that ""all events that will draw crowds and visitors in the next three weeks"" are also canceled, he said.
The city government has yet to decide if it will push through with the Grand Street Parade and Grand Float Parade scheduled on February 29 and March 1 respectively.
""There’s still no definitive decision... We would just like to be proactive about this,"" the mayor said.
Magalong earlier said that while Baguio City has yet to record any cases of novel coronavirus, the local government remains vigilant.

HONG KONG - Markets rose in Asia on Friday after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency over the new coronavirus sweeping China.
After saying last week they needed more information, the WHO invoked the rarely used designation that experts hope will lead to better international coordination to combat a disease that has already killed 200 people, and sickened thousands more.
But the Geneva-based body stopped short of recommending trade and travel restrictions that could have had a bruising effect on China -- a key growth engine for the world economy.
""This is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesushe said, praising Beijing for its swift action to tackle the outbreak.
China has locked down a swathe of its center, effectively quarantining millions of people in their cities and halting travel around the country.
""We must all act together now to limit further spread... We can only stop it together,"" said Tedros, who traveled to China this week and met with President Xi Jinping.
Foreign airlines -- including British Airways -- have begun cancelling or curtailing flights to and from China, and a number of governments are recommending citizens do not visit the country.
But Tedros said there was ""no reason"" for any of the international travel or trade restrictions announced in recent days.
Investors applauded the WHO's move, plunging back into markets that have lost altitude over recent days as the 2019-nCoV crisis has worsened.
""Sure the WHO raised the alert, but they didn't ring the apocalypse bell so it could be time for risk-takers to come out of hibernation,"" said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp.
The WHO move ""eased some mushrooming fears by suggesting the number of outbreaks is relatively small"", he said.
Tokyo led the way on Asian equity markets, with the Nikkei 225 up 1.3 percent by the break, Hong Kong rose 0.3 percent, while Seoul and Sydney added 0.4 percent.
The reversal on major indexes had begun in New York, where the WHO's announcement sent Wall Street green after a session largely in the red.
Oil was up, partially correcting a days-long drop, with March contracts for major benchmarks WTI and Brent adding around 1.0 percent.
""While it's virtually impossible to quantify the full extent of the demand destruction from the virus outbreak, if there was one asset class more oversold than others, it had to be oil given the bigger-than-life global supply overhang,"" said Innes.

WUHAN - A gray-haired man wearing a face mask lay dead on the pavement at ground zero of China's virus epidemic, a plastic shopping bag in one hand.
On what would typically be a crowded street in Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million under quarantine, there are only a few passersby and they dare not go near him.
AFP journalists saw the body on Thursday morning, not long before an emergency vehicle arrived carrying police and medical staff in full-body protective suits.
The man lay straight on his back in front of a closed furniture store. Medical staff in blue overalls gently shrouded his body with a blue blanket.
The ambulance left, and police stacked supermarket cardboard boxes to hide the scene.
AFP could not determine how the man, who appeared to be in his 60s, had died. AFP contacted police and local health officials afterwards but could not get details on his case.
But the reaction of the police and medical staff in hazmat suits, as well as some of the bystanders, highlighted the fear pervading the city.
A woman standing near the man, wearing pink pajamas and a Mao cap, said she believed he had died from the virus.
""It's terrible,"" she said. ""These days many people have died.""
Wuhan is the epicenter of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which is believed to have jumped from wild animals at a city market into humans.
The virus, which emerged late last year, has claimed at least 213 lives and infected thousands in China, with at least 159 deaths in Wuhan alone.
With the virus spreading to other countries, the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency.

TORMENT
Authorities have imposed an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan, blocking off roads out of the city and banning flights, in a bid to stop the virus spreading.
Those who are trapped are enduring a tormenting wait for the lockdown to end, for a cure to be found, or even just for check-ups at overwhelmed hospitals. 
AFP reporters in Wuhan have seen long queues at hospitals, with some patients saying they had lined up for 2 days to see a doctor.
Many brought their own chairs for the wait.
With most traffic banned, people who venture outside have to walk or bike everywhere in the huge city.
The dead man on the street on Thursday lay one block from the Wuhan Number Six Hospital, one of the main medical centers for treating those with virus symptoms.
A team of forensic experts who examined him were immediately sprayed with disinfectant by colleagues after removing their hazardous material suits.
One man smoking near the scene was told sharply by police to put out his cigarette and don a face mask.
He quickly followed their orders.
In the 2 hours that AFP observed the scene, at least 15 ambulances passed by, attending other calls.
Finally, a white van with blacked-out windows arrived to take away the man.
The body was zipped into a yellow surgical bag, and carried into the van on a stretcher.
Staff immediately began to clean the ground as the van drove away, disinfecting the streets where the body had laid.

MANILA - Filipinos who may seek medical attention with symptoms of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will get health coverage from the state health insurance agency, the country's top health official said on Friday.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) convened on Thursday and decided to offer the new coronavirus package.
""The package is about a thousand per day for the hospital that takes care of a patient, even not confirmed, basta (as long as) suspected with novel coronavirus,"" said Duque on ANC's Headstart.
He said if the patient develops pneumonia, there is another PhilHealth package that may apply. 
""If pneumonia sets in then there's pneumonia package of mild, P16,000; severe P32,000,"" he said.
The Philippines on Thursday confirmed its first case of the 2019-nCoV, a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. She is now in an undisclosed government hospital in Metro Manila and currently asymptomatic. 
Some 31 others are under investigation for the acute respiratory disease. 
At least 200 people have died, while close to 10,000 people have been infected in several parts of China and countries in Europe, Asia and North America. 
Its symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties, according to the World Health Organization.

MANILA - There is no present evidence that pets, such as dogs and cats, can be infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the World Health Organization said. 
""However, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets. This protects you against various common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella that can pass between pets and humans,"" the WHO said.
The WHO said the spread of the new coronavirus is a global emergency, saying 2019-nCoV can affect ""people of all ages.""

WHO declares global emergency as 2019-nCoV spreads quickly 

""Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus,"" it said.
Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the 2019-nCoV? Certainly not, according to the WHO.
""Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The new coronavirus is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment,"" it said.
WHO, however, stressed, ""However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.""
To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the virus, according to the WHO.
""However, those infected with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials,"" it said.

China virus death toll tops 200 as WHO declares global emergency

The virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Dec., has claimed at least 213 lives and sickened nearly 10,000 others in China as of Friday.
It has also spread to at least 18 countries, including the Philippines, which recorded its first confirmed case of the virus on Thursday.

MANILA (UPDATE) - Vice President Leni Robredo on Friday urged President Rodrigo Duterte to ban all travelers coming from China after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a global emergency.
""Ang kasalukuyang banta ng coronavirus sa bawat Pilipino ay nangangailangan ng agarang aksyon mula sa ating pamahalaan,"" she said in a statement.
(The threat of the coronavirus needs immediate action from our government.)
Robredo added, ""Bawat minutong ipapagbukas pa ang pag-aksyon sa mga rekomendasyong ito, lalong nailalagay sa panganib ang kapakanan at kalusugan ng ating mga mamamayan.""

In her statement, Robredo also urged the Duterte administration to give support to Filipinos that could be affected by the virus, which health authorities said could be transmitted between humans through close contact.
""Buhay ng tao ang nakasalalay kaya agarang aksyon, tamang impormasyon at mabilisang desisyon ang kailangan,"" she said.
(People's lives are at stake that's why it needs immediate action, correct information and swift decision.)
Robredo added, ""Sa panahon ng krisis, dapat makaasa ang taumbayan sa kanyang pamahalaan na walang aaksayahing oras para unahin ang kanilang kapakanan.""
(In times of crisis, the Filipino people must be able to depend on their government, which should not waste time in prioritizing their well-being.)

Her statement comes a day after the Philippine government confirmed the country's first case of the virus -- a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China who arrived in the Philippines January 21. 
The woman arrived in Manila via Hong Kong on Jan. 21. She is now in an undisclosed government hospital.

MANILA - The Philippines will launch a hotline for Filipino migrant workers in China who wish to relay their concerns over the spread of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a Palace official said Thursday.
The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) will be responsible for the hotline, Communications Secretary Martin Andanar said as the Philippines confirmed its first case of the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
""We will also create a coronavirus hotline to assist the OFWs and other Filipinos residing in China for virus prevention and countermeasures,"" Andanar said in a statement.
""We will continue to serve our overseas Filipino workers (OFW), and will coordinate with Chinese authorities for repatriation efforts, as needed, to assist our nationals in China,"" he added.

Philippines confirms first case of new coronavirus

Some Filipinos in China have expressed desire to come home amid the global outbreak of the virus, which has killed at least 170 and infected nearly 8,000 people across China, other parts of Asia, Europe, and North America.
President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday night said the government is ready to repatriate them but noted that precautionary measures must be in place.
“We are always conscious of our citizens there. If they are going home, we are ready to ferry them back to the Philippines but all precautions must be in place,” Duterte said.

APPEAL FOR CALM
Andanar also appealed for sobriety over Manila's first confirmed case of the 2019-nCoV.
""With the first confirmed case of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus, we ask the public not to panic and to remain calm as the government, especially the Department of Health, is on top of the situation,"" Andanar said.
""Let’s continue to remain calm and heed the advisories of the DOH and the rest of the government on the matter..."" he added.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed Thursday the Philippines' first case of the virus, a 38-year-old Chinese patient from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
The woman arrived in Manila via Hong Kong on Jan. 21, and is now in an undisclosed government hospital in Metro Manila.
Andanar assured Filipinos that stricter security measures would be implemented in all ports of entry in the country to prevent the spread of the virus.
""With the continuous inflow of travelers coming from affected areas in China, we will continue to conduct necessary stringent customs, immigration, and quarantine measures to prevent the disease from spreading within the country,"" he said.
""We advise everyone to observe all health and preventive advisories issued by the DOH on the matter... Please remain vigilant and coordinate with your local barangay health centers should you observe symptoms associated with the 2019-nCoV,"" he added.
Several senators on Thursday called on the Palace to bar travelers from China to better prevent the entry of those infected with the virus.

MANILA - A research facility in the University of the Philippines (UP) said Thursday it would help health authorities confirm cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the country.
""The Philippines has the tools and cutting-edge equipment, trained DNA sequencing staff, and scientists to help validate the presence of 2019-nCoV in the country by sequencing the whole viral genome from samples collected from patients,"" Dr. Cynthia Saloma, executive director of the Philippine Genome Center (PGC), said in a statement.
The facility will assist the Department of Health (DOH) and Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on diagnosing possible cases of the illness, which has killed at least 170 in China as of Thursday. Some 81,000 others globally are under observation for possible infection.

China virus death toll rises to 170, more than 1,700 new cases 

Using a Next Generation DNA/RNA Sequencing (NGS) equipment, the Philippines will no longer have to send samples of suspected 2019-nCoV cases abroad, said Dr. Jan Michael Yap, head of PGC's core facility for bioinformatics.
""We can do it here,"" he told ABS-CBN News in a phone interview, adding the results could be released after 3 days.
The equipment, Yap said, is a fast, accurate way of identifying the genetic information of viruses.
The Philippine government already confirmed the country's first case, a 38-year-old woman from Wuhan, China who arrived in Manila on January 21.

BEIJING - China announced Thursday the suspension of all domestic football and postponed indefinitely the top-flight Chinese Super League (CSL) season in response to the deadly viral outbreak sweeping the country. 
The CSL 2020 campaign had been due to kick off on Feb. 22, but was shelved along with ""all types of football matches"" in order to ""carry out prevention and control of the pneumonia epidemic,"" said a Chinese Football Association statement.
The announcement comes just a few hours after the World Indoor Athletics Championships, scheduled to take place in the Chinese city of Nanjing in March, were postponed until 2021 after advice from the World Health Organization.
Football is fanatically followed in the world's most populous nation with cash-rich clubs importing expensive foreign signings such as Brazilians Hulk and Oscar, and Argentina's Carlos Tevez in recent years.
It becomes the latest sport to be hit by the virus which by Thursday had seen more than 7,700 cases confirmed in China with at least 170 fatalities.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it? 

The virus has spread from the epicenter of Wuhan to more than 15 countries, with about 60 cases in Asia, Europe, North America and, most recently, the Middle East. 
On Wednesday, World Cup skiing races, the first test events for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, were canceled because of the outbreak. 
The men's downhill and super-G races were scheduled for Feb. 15 and 16 in Yanqing, 70 kilometers northwest of Beijing.
WORLD CUP QUALIFYING
In Australia, the China women's football team has been quarantined in a Brisbane hotel after arriving for an Olympic qualifying competition which had been originally due to take place in Wuhan.
The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Wednesday ordered all 4 Chinese clubs' first 3 fixtures in the continent's Champions League's group stage in February and March to be played away from home.
The AFC said the decision was a ""precautionary measure to ensure the safety and well-being of all participating players and teams.""

WUHAN - China reported its biggest single-day jump in novel coronavirus deaths on Thursday, as confirmation that 3 Japanese evacuated from the outbreak's epicenter were infected deepened fears about a global contagion.
The World Health Organization (WHO), which initially downplayed the severity of a disease that has now killed 170 nationwide, warned all governments to be ""on alert"" as it weighed whether to declare a global health emergency.
As foreign countries evacuated their citizens from Wuhan, the locked-down city where the virus was first detected, concern over the economic impact has steadily intensified.
Airlines have suspended services to China and companies from Starbucks to Tesla have shuttered stores and production lines.

China virus death toll rises to 170, more than 1,700 new cases

Chinese authorities have taken extraordinary steps to arrest the virus's spread, including effectively locking down more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.
But that was yet to pay dividends, with the government reporting 38 new deaths in the 24 hours to Thursday, the highest 1-day total. All but one were in Hubei.
The number of confirmed new cases also grew steadily to 7,711, the National Health Commission said. Another 81,000 people were under observation for possible infection.
The pathogen is believed to have been spawned in a market that sold wild game, spreading far and wide by a Lunar New Year holiday season in which hundreds of millions of Chinese travel domestically or abroad.
'TOTALLY NEW SITUATION'
Japan's infection rate grew to 11 after 3 Japanese citizens among more than 200 on an evacuation flight Wednesday tested positive.
Officials had already confirmed 2 cases in which patients tested positive without having traveled to China, adding to anxiety over human-to-human transmission of the respiratory disease.
""We are in a truly new situation,"" Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told parliament.
The fact that 2 of the 3 new confirmed Japanese cases showed no symptoms underscored the scale of the challenge for health workers.

3 Japanese evacuated from Wuhan have new coronavirus

The WHO has come under fire after it last week declined to declare a global health emergency.
The global health body's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed regret for what he called a ""human error"" in the WHO's assessment.
WHO's Emergency Committee will meet Thursday to decide whether to declare an emergency -- which could lead to travel or trade barriers.
""The whole world needs to take action,"" Michael Ryan, head of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, told reporters in Geneva.

WHO warns world to 'take action' over 2019-nCoV

A US charter flight from Wuhan arrived Wednesday at a California military base with nearly 200 consular staff and other Americans, who ""cheered loudly"" when the jet touched down, said an official with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
All passengers were declared symptom-free but will remain isolated for days while they are monitored.

US evacuees from China placed on 72-hour 'hold' at California military base for medical evaluation

Some 250 French citizens and 100 other Europeans will be flown out of Wuhan on board 2 French planes this week.
Australia plans to house any citizens it evacuates from the city on an island normally used to detain asylum seekers.
A growing number of governments -- including the United States, Britain and Germany -- have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China.
China also has urged its own citizens to delay trips abroad, after more than 15 countries confirmed infections.
FLIGHTS SCRAPPED, STORES CLOSED
Major airlines that have suspended or pared back service to China include British Airways, German flag carrier Lufthansa, American Airlines, KLM, and United.
China's efforts to halt the virus have seen the suspension of classes nationwide and an extension of the Lunar New Year holiday.
Most street traffic in and around Wuhan has been banned.

Experts say China virus outbreak will last months at least

""This is the first day since the lockdown that I've had to go out,"" a man in his 50s told AFP on the mostly deserted streets of the industrial city.
""I have no choice because I need to buy food.""
China's football body meanwhile said it was postponing ""all levels and all types of football matches across the country,"" including the country's top-tier Chinese Super League, in response to the outbreak.
ECONOMIC WORRIES
Japanese automaker Toyota, Swedish furniture giant IKEA, tech giant Foxconn, Starbucks, Tesla and McDonald's were among major corporate giants to temporarily freeze production or close large numbers of outlets in China.
As the ""world's factory,"" the disruptions in China are expected to send ripples through supply chains globally, denting profits.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it? 

The contagion has spread to nearly every corner of China, with remote Tibet reporting its first case on Thursday.
It has triggered fears in part due to its striking similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, which also began in China and eventually killed nearly 800 people worldwide.

SAIPAN - The Northern Mariana Islands banned all travelers from China and declared a ""state of significant emergency"" Thursday, as Pacific island states stepped up measures to protect against the coronavirus outbreak. 
Although Chinese tourist traffic is a pillar of the economy in the US Pacific commonwealth, Northern Mariana governor Ralph Torres said the new coronavirus ""poses a significant and imminent threat.""
In China, where the epidemic originated, 170 have died with thousands more infected.
Although no suspected cases of the virus have been recorded in the Northern Marianas, Torres said the risk remained ""substantial"" due to incubation times.
""I find that the public health threat of a traveler from mainland China carrying the coronavirus is significant and cannot be understated,"" he said.
""The Commonwealth Ports Authority shall communicate with all airlines with travelers directly and indirectly from mainland China to suspend the arrival of travelers for the period of this emergency declaration."" 
Because of the impact the emergency declaration will have on the economy, Torres said he had also ordered an immediate cost-impact analysis on the annual budget. 
The Northern Mariana Islands are a self-governing chain of islands that has the US president as head of state.

Anyone from China, or who has transited through China, must spend at least 14 days in a country not affected by the new coronavirus before they can enter the Marshall Islands.
""In the event a traveler arrives in the Marshall Islands within the 14-day period, entry will be denied,"" Health Secretary Jack Niedenthal said. 
Palau, which last year received more than 30,000 tourists from China, its main market, is suspending all flights from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau from Saturday despite the economic impact.

SEOUL - South Korean President Moon Jae-in urged residents not to give in to fear as the country prepared to evacuate the first of around 700 citizens from the epicenter of the new coronavirus epidemic in China on Thursday.
The first of up to 4 planned flights to Wuhan had been due to depart South Korea on Thursday morning, but were delayed for unspecified reasons, Yonhap news agency reported. The flights were still expected to depart by later in the day.
""The weapons that will protect us from the new coronavirus are not fear and aversion but trust and cooperation,"" Moon said in a speech on Thursday, decrying ""fake news"" as creating excessive anxiety.
Protesters used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centers in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, about 80 km (50 miles) south of Seoul, on Wednesday.
The government has proposed to keep the evacuated citizens in isolation at the facilities, usually used as training centers for public servants, for at least 2 weeks to ensure they do not develop symptoms.
Moon tried to reassure residents, saying the initial evacuees would only be those with no symptoms, and they will be held in isolation.
""The government will be taking air-tight steps to ensure the residents of areas where the facilities are do not need to be concerned,"" he said.
South Korea has reported 4 cases of the newly identified virus, all of whom arrived after visiting the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the pathogen appeared in humans late last year.
The new strain of coronavirus has an incubation of between 1 and 14 days and can spread before symptoms show, complicating efforts to screen people at international borders.
It has created widespread alarm because it is spreading quickly and there are still important unknowns surrounding it, but it is still too early to know what its death rate will be, because there are likely to be many cases of milder infections going undetected.
South Korea said the inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, North Korea, would be closed until the outbreak eased. North Korea would not allow South Korean officials to enter the office when they arrived on Thursday, Yonhap reported, citing South Korea's unification ministry.

MARCH AIR RESERVE BASE, California - Nearly 200 Americans airlifted from China in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak arrived on Wednesday at a US military base in California, where they will remain isolated for at least 72 hours of medical evaluation, public health officials said.
The group, mostly US diplomats and their families, were evacuated from Wuhan at the epicenter of the outbreak aboard a US government-chartered cargo jet that stopped to refuel in Alaska on Tuesday night before flying on to March Air Reserve Base, about 60 miles (97 km) east of Los Angeles.
Foreign governments have begun flying their citizens out of Wuhan as the death toll has risen and the city has entered into a virtual quarantine, with Chinese authorities trying to contain the virus.

China virus death toll rises to 170, more than 1,700 new cases

The 195 passengers at March air base were medically screened by Chinese government and US State Department officials before boarding the plane in Wuhan, and again during the refueling stop by a team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC officials said.
All the passengers have agreed to remain voluntarily in special housing at the military base, cordoned off from base personnel, for 72 hours.
""These people are not under federal quarantine orders,"" said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.
""I personally talked to them when they were disembarking and going through their first screening checks. They were happy to be here. They were very cooperative with the questions,"" Braden told a news conference at the Riverside University Health System Medical Center, near the base. ""They want to protect themselves. They want to protect others.""
NO ONE SHOWED SYMPTOMS
The US evacuees, who underwent another round of screening on arrival in California, will be given further medical evaluations, including a blood test for exposure to the virus, over the next 3 days, the officials said.
None of the arriving passengers has so far exhibited any signs of illness such as fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms, the officials said.
The screening in Alaska included a questionnaire to check for factors that would deem them to have been at high risk of infection, including exposure to someone diagnosed with coronavirus or close contact to someone living with a person who was sick.
""There were no individuals who responded to the questions indicating they were high-risk,"" said Dr. Nancy Knight, director of the CDC's Division of Global Health Protection. ""We are reassessing that now.""
One individual on the original evacuation manifest was barred from boarding the plane in China because the person had a fever.

New coronavirus study places incubation period at around 5 days

The State Department ordered its personnel evacuated from the US Consulate in Wuhan and welcomed other American citizens onto the flight because there was excess room on the plane, CDC officials said. The group included an unspecified number of children, ranging from a month-old infant to teenagers, they said.
The plan is to allow the evacuees to return to their homes once the initial evaluation period is over, provided there is no indication of exposure or illness, the officials said.
At that point, absent any symptoms or a positive test result, an individual would be considered non-infectious and be permitted to travel on public transportation without putting others at risk, Braden said.
FREE TO LEAVE?
People who may be incubating the infection before any symptoms appear are not believed to be contagious, Braden said.
Health authorities will continue ""active monitoring"" of all the passengers through the end of a 14-day incubation period, and plans are in place to isolate any individual who shows signs of illness after going home.
If any evacuees test positive or fall ill in the next 3 days, they would be transferred to the Riverside Medical Center for isolation and treatment, and authorities would decide what measures need to be taken for the rest of the group, Braden said.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

Asked if someone in the group who tested negative before the 72-hour hold was over would be free to leave the base early, Knight said that would lead to a conversation that ""would be discussed up to the highest levels within the US government.""
""If we think a person is a danger to the community, we can institute an individual quarantine for that person, and we will,"" Braden added. ""If we think it's risky, then we have the tools to protect the public and we will use them.""
So far, 5 cases of coronavirus have been diagnosed in the United States, none of them fatal, Braden said. A further 165, other than the plane passengers, are under evaluation.
""There's no indication we have any transmission from those cases, and therefore the risk for people in the United States, we believe, is low,"" Braden said.

2020-01-30,nCov,Public urged to trust gov’t info as fake news spreads faster than Wuhan virus,"Christian V. Esguerra, ABS-CBN News","
MANILA—At a time when misinformation can spread faster than diseases, Philippine health officials have adopted a stronger social media campaign to combat fake news about the deadly Wuhan coronavirus.
A new Department of Health website is dedicated solely to updates on the disease, formally known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, which has killed more than 130 people in China and sickened nearly 6,000 others as of Wednesday.
As officials work to prevent the disease from entering the Philippines, managing what Health Secretary Francisco Duque III described as an “epidemic of misinformation” also poses a challenge.
Groups of fact-checkers from 30 countries have also been working to correct false information being spread on social media.
In the Philippines, Duque cited questionable videos circulating online showing coronavirus patients supposedly dropping dead while awaiting treatment at a Chinese hospital.
The public should be “discriminating and at least verify” the source of such videos, he said.
TRUST GOV’T
The health department’s website “urges the public to source information only from official DOH channels and social media accounts.”
Among the common victims of fake information during a public health crisis situation are hospitals, said Dr. Lulu Bravo, a former official of the Manila-based National Insitutes of Health at the University of the Philippines.
Word can easily spread around that a patient of the Wuhan coronavirus is admitted and prompt others to seek discharge even if they’re still unwell, she said.
While existing health protocols have so far successfully kept the disease out, she said “fake news spreads quickly here in the Philippines” so the public should turn only to official information from the DOH.

False virus news can drag 'better prepared' Philippines: ex-SARS fighter

“Let’s trust the government,” she told ABS-CBN, recalling systems put in place during previous outbreaks such as that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
“Beterano na ang DOH dyan.”
SURGICAL MASKS
A World Health Organization official on Tuesday took the opportunity during a press briefing in Manila to reassure those worried about catching the disease.
Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the WHO respresentative in the Philippines, pointed to several journalists wearing surgical masks.
People should do so only if they have “signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection” or if going to places where there is a “concentration of people that can trigger infections,” he said.
“Normal people going about their normal work don’t need to wear surgical masks or N95 masks,” he told reporters.
“You don’t need to wear a mask from morning till evening.”
INFORMATION SYSTEM
Like the DOH, the WHO has also been dealing with false information being spread around, which makes it more difficult for authorities to contain the new coronavirus.
Abeyasinghe urged the public to get information from the WHO website.
“People are free to access social media and sometimes access incorrect information,” he told ABS-CBN News. “That’s what we’re trying to manage.”
One way to combat the spread misinformation is building “resilient health systems that are well-resourced and prepared to stop outbreaks before they begin,” according to a study by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
“Rather than engaging in censorship to counter actors or ideas individually,” it said, “policymakers and industry should focus on building a resilient information system that is ready to mitigate the effectiveness of misinformation without restricting the free marketplace of ideas.”

MANILA - The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines issued Wednesday an ""Oratio Imperata"" or a special prayer imploring protection from the novel coronavirus outbreak.
In a statement, the CBCP enjoined all parishes in the country of at least 80 million Roman Catholics to recite the prayer beginning Sunday, Feb. 2, the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord.
The ""oratio"" is expected to be offered in Masses during weekdays and Sundays, after the Holy Communion. 
""In praying, we invite ourselves with all our brothers and sisters suffering with the disease brought by the virus, bring up to God our longing for them to be restored to full health and humbly pray that we may be spared form infection of this virus,"" said Rev. Fr. Marvin Mejia, the CBCP's secretary general. 
The CBCP is also recommending the following:
1. Communion in the hand be practiced ordinarily to help prevent further fear from people who are reasonably cautious about this matter;
2. Regularly check and change the Holy Water in the Holy Water fonts in churches;
3. Provide/install protective cloth on the grills of confessionals; and,
4. Discourage hand-holding during the singing or praying of the ""Our Father"" and the shaking of hand during the Sign of Peace. 
""Let it also be our pastoral duty to remind our faithful to heed the health recommendation of medical experts and officials so that we prevent the acquisition and spread of the disease,"" Mejia added. 
The CBCP is advising parishes, churches, and chapels dedicated to St. Raphael the Archangel and St. Roch (Roche or Roque) to make special prayers and penitential processions. The two are considered patrons in times of pestilence and spread of incurable illnesses.
Below is the full text of the prayer:
ORATIO IMPERATA
God our Father
we come to You in our need
to ask Your protection against the 2019 N-coronavirus
that has claimed lives
and has affected many.
We pray for Your grace
for the people tasked with studying the nature and cause
of this virus and its disease
and of stemming the tide of its transmission.
Guide the hands and minds of medical experts
that they may minister to the sick
with competence and compassion
and of those governments and private agencies
that must find cure and solution to this epidemic.
We pray for those afflicted.
May they be restored to health soon. 
Grant us the grace
to work for the good of all
and to help those in need. 
Grant this through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son
who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God forever and ever. Amen. 
The new strain of the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has already killed more than 100 people, and infected nearly 6,000 others.

Measles is more contagious than 2019-nCoV, says DOH
MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines on Wednesday is monitoring 23 suspected cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus as 4 others have already tested negative, health officials said.
Four patients were discharged from the hospital after being cleared of the new respiratory virus that is plaguing China, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a press briefing.
The Philippines remains free from the 2019-nCoV that has already claimed at least 132 lives in China and infected nearly 6,000 others.
""Confirmed cases, zero,"" Duque said.

China confirms 5,974 virus cases, exceeding nation's SARS total

Health authorities are keeping a watchful eye on 17 cases in the National Capital Region (NCR), 1 in Western Visayas, 1 in Mimaropa, 1 in Eastern Visayas, 2 in Central Visayas and 1 in Davao Region.
Most are foreigners who had traveled to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the respiratory contagion that started from a market selling illegal wildlife.
As infections have been confirmed in other countries, such as the United States, France and many Asian countries, Duque called on the public to remain calm, but vigilant.
To limit the possible transmission of the flu-like virus, he said the public should practice hand hygiene, observe cough etiquette, avoid contact with farm and wild animals, and cook food properly, among others.
""It's better to be proactive and prepared,"" he said.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), according to the World Health Organization. 
CONTACT RATE
Dr. Chito Avelino, DOH's epidemiology bureau director, said the infection rate for 2019-nCoV ranged from 2 to 4.
""That means that for 1 individual infected, there's a possibility for him to transmit [the virus] to 2 to 3 or 4 uninfected individuals, at close range. The basic principle is close contact,"" he said.
Compared with other diseases, the new strain of coronavirus is not as contagious, Avelino said.
""Mas nakakahawa ang tigdas (Measles is more infectious),"" he said.
According to Duque, the infectiousness rate of measles is 1 person to 18.
TEST KITS
At the press briefing, Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo said confirmatory test kits or ""primers"" ordered by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) have arrived in the country Wednesday.
""They are now setting up the laboratory for this. Once the laboratory is set up within 48 hours, they will be able to start running the test for the 2019 novel coronavirus here in the Philippines,"" he said.
The RITM sends specimen samples to the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference in Australia to confirm if the patient is infected with 2019-nCoV. The process usually takes 24 hours.
""The subsequent tests will now be done by RITM,"" Domingo said.
The RITM has 6 pending confirmatory tests in Australia, the results of which are expected Thursday or Friday.

HONG KONG - Migrant support group Mission for Migrant Workers (MFMW) on Tuesday called on the Hong Kong government to provide clear labor guidelines and health precautionary measures for the city's estimated 300,000 foreign domestic workers, after a Filipino domestic helper was quarantined for coming into close contact with 2 people who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
Cynthia Abdon, the group's manager, expressed concern on the plight of foreign household helpers who, as mandated by a law in effect since 2003, live with their employers.

""Iyan ba ay ire-recognize ng employer na official sa Labor Department? Nililinaw ba nila... halimbawa connected sa official hospital or health department policy...na i-quarantine ang mga nasa ganitong kalagayan? Ang kanila bang mga trabaho o ang mga sahod nila sa mga araw na sila ay naka-quarantine ay official pa rin ba na dapat nilang matanggap? Dapat. Kasi hindi naman sila ang may cause ng pangyayaring 'yon,"" Abdon told ABS-CBN News.
(Will this case be officially recognized by her employer to be in line with the Labor Department? They want to clarify, for example, with those connected with the official hospital or health department policy, whether those in that kind of condition need to be quarantined? Will they continue to receive salary for the days they are on quarantine? Well, they should, because they didn't cause the situation they are in.)
Abdon said they also received reports domestic workers who spend time outside are told to hurry home, including on their rest days, amid fears of the 2019-nCoV spread. 
""Kaya 'pag nasa loob ka ng bahay (ng employer mo), alangan naman... sabi nila doon ka lang sa loob ng kuwarto mo kung may kuwarto ka man. Paano na 'yong sa mga wala rin kuwarto. Hindi puwede. Mahihiya ka rin kahit paano na hindi ka mag trabaho... kahit day-off mo, kahit holiday,"" said Abdon.
(When you are at your employer's home, they could tell you to just stay inside your room. That is if you have your own room. But what about those without their own room? ... Somehow, you feel ashamed if you do not do some chores, even if it's your rest day, or it's a holiday.)
Abdon urged consulates of migrants-sending countries to coordinate with the host government in disseminating proper and similar information, ""in a language friendly to migrants,"" saying that migrant domestic workers ""are part of the Hong Kong community.""
""Meaning, of course 'yong language ng migrant domestic workers in Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Sri Lankan, ano man 'yan. At the very least, dapat may English. Kasi ngayon, halimbawa, meron kaming Chinese staff. So, nakukuha namin 'yong mga information sa mga Chinese newspapers o Chinese information na pinapakalat nila sa kaniya lang. Pa'no po 'yong mga walang access?"" said Abdon.
(Meaning, of course, such languages of migrant domestic workers as Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Sri Lankan, or whatever it is. At the very least, there should be English. Because right now, we have a Chinese staff. So, we get information from Chinese newspapers or information in Chinese that they are sharing. But how about the rest who do not have access?)
The MFMW complained about confusing instructions on the proper wearing and use of face masks, say, if one is in a closed building.
""Dapat ka bang mag-mask? Hindi ka ba dapat mag-mask? Gaano mo kalimit papalitan ang mask? Pati yan issue 'yan, 'di ba? So ang mahalaga lang, 'wag ma-curtail 'yong right ng ating migrant domestic workers na sa panahon na ganito, pati ang employers ay nagpa-panic na rin, sapagkat hindi malinaw ang mga opisyal na directives ng government,"" said Abdon.
(Should you wear a mask? Should you not wear a mask? How often should you change masks? It's important that our domestic workers' rights will not be curtailed in times like this, because even employers are already panicking because official directives from the government are not clear.)

Pinay in HK quarantined after exposure to new coronavirus: consulate

The Filipino domestic worker in quarantine had been exposed to an elderly couple who tested positive for the novel coronavirus after arriving in Hong Kong from Wuhan by high-speed rail on Jan. 22. They developed fever and were admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital in Shatin on January 23.
The couple had been staying with their daughter and the domestic helper at Lake Silver Estate in Ma On Shan.
The helper showed no symptoms, but has to be quarantined for 14 days from Jan. 23. Health officials stressed she was not a patient, but a confinee.

At a press conference by the Department of Health and Hospital Authority on Monday, Dr. Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch of the Center for Health Protection of the Department of Health, confirmed that the Filipino remained asymptomatic, adding she had been quarantined ""just like other local residents"" who are quarantined in the camp.
""All asymptomatic confinees will not be tested because, even if you test, it is negative; it won't be positive usually. So... they are checking the symptoms, they are checking their temperatures and symptoms daily. We have a 24-hour medical post in the camp... Whenever they have symptoms, they will be checked. And then, they will be sent to the hospital for testing and isolation. So, if they are asymptomatic, there is no point to test them,"" Dr. Chuang told ABS-CBN News.
Most offices and businesses in Hong Kong remain closed in observance of the Lunar New Year holidays. In November last year, announcements were made to scrap the annual Lunar New Year parade and the New Year's Eve fireworks display over fears of protest.
A 4-day carnival for the Chinese New Year celebrations was supposed to take place instead, but had been dropped as well in light of the spread of the 2019-nCoV.
As of noontime Tuesday, most government facilities are closed, while others are on special working arrangements. The closures are stretching up to the first week of February, and even the week after for some.
As of Jan. 27, the Center for Health Protection of Hong Kong's Department of Health is monitoring eight imported cases.
The Hospital Authority said 110 patients are under isolation, of whom, 104 are in stable condition.
The public is continuously reminded to strictly maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene.

BEIJING - The World Health Organization's (WHO) director-general said on Tuesday he is confident in China's ability to control and contain the spread of a new coronavirus, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
At a meeting with authorities in Beijing, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he approved of the Chinese government's measures to curb the outbreak so far, according to a statement posted on the foreign affairs ministry's website.
The death toll from the virus has climbed to 106 in China and cases are being reported in a growing number of other countries.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

The WHO called the epidemic ""an emergency in China"" on Jan. 23, but stopped short of declaring it a global public health emergency.
Tedros said he does not advocate the evacuation of foreign nationals currently in China, and urged people to stay calm.
Several countries including the United States, France, Japan, South Korea and Morocco have said they will evacuate some citizens from Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China and the epicenter of the outbreak.
Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year, apparently in a market illegally selling wildlife, has been put on a virtual lockdown with bans on almost all transport and public gatherings.
Tens of millions of others in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, live under some form of travel curbs in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.

The coronavirus can cause pneumonia, but it is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads.
Some health experts have questioned whether China can contain it.
Chinese health officials say the incubation period could range from 1 to 14 days, and the virus is infectious during that time. The WHO estimated an incubation period of 2 to 10 days.

BANGKOK - Thailand announced plans on Tuesday to screen all arrivals from China for symptoms of a deadly virus and confirmed 6 more infections among such visitors, taking the southeast Asian nation's tally to 14, health officials said.
The new strain of coronavirus claimed its first victim in Beijing, the Chinese capital, taking the death toll to 106 as infections reached 4,515, although there have been no deaths outside China.
Five victims among Thailand's new cases, aged between 6 and 70, came from China's central province of Hubei, and belonged to the same family, health official Tanarak Plipat, told reporters, and the sixth from southwestern Chongqing province.

MANILA - The Philippine government is studying the possible repatriation of Filipinos from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the global epicenter of a new coronavirus outbreak, as migrant workers there expressed desire to come home.
Malacañang will wait for the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on the return of some 150 Filipinos from Wuhan, Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said, noting that the government has to be “cautious” to ensure that the Philippines remains free of the virus.
“We must consider the health issue on the spread [of the virus]. Ano ba mas makakabuti? That they’ll stay there for a while until the crisis is over or we’ll get them and bring them here and open the possibility of spreading it here?” he told reporters.
Filipinos working in Wuhan, where the virus outbreak started in December, have expressed worries over their condition as the Chinese city sought to control the spread of the virus.

Authorities have barred travel to and from Chinese province Hubei and its capital Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected before it spread across China and to a dozen other countries.
Health officials also confirmed cases of the virus in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States.
Panelo added that the government would also review the possible repatriation of Filipinos in other countries where there are confirmed cases of coronavirus.
On Tuesday, the Bureau of Immigration (BI) said it would temporarily stop issuing tourist visas on arrival to Chinese nationals in light of the virus scare.

SHANGHAI/SEOUL - Facebook Inc and other global companies including LG Electronics Inc and Standard Chartered Plc are restricting travel to China, as the death toll from a flu-like virus rose above 100 on Tuesday.
Airlines are also canceling flights and adjusting schedules as a growing number of countries raise travel warnings to not just Hubei province where the new coronavirus broke out, but also to the rest of mainland China.
The United States warned on Monday that Americans should ""reconsider"" visiting all of China, while South Korea elevated its travel warning on Tuesday, advising its citizens to refrain from visiting China.
Facebook became the first major US company to announce a travel suspension after the US government's warning.
The US social media company asked employees to halt non-essential travel to mainland China and told employees who had traveled there to work from home, a spokesman said on Tuesday.
""Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken steps to protect the health and safety of our employees,"" the spokesman told Reuters.

South Korean home appliances maker LG has put a complete ban on travel to China and has advised employees on business trips in the country to return home as quickly as possible, a company spokeswoman said.
South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc said it was urging employees to avoid all non-essential travel to China, while banking group Standard Chartered restricted travel to both mainland China and Hong Kong.
In Germany, auto supplier Webasto, which has 11 sites in China, including in Wuhan, has halted all corporate travel to and from China following the virus and the infection of an employee.
Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd said it recommended employees avoid travel to China, while Nissan Motor Co said it planned to evacuate its Japanese staff and their families in Wuhan via a government-chartered flight.
As companies reassessed the risk of travel to China, some airlines said demand for flights was falling and they were adjusting schedules.
South Korean budget carrier Air Seoul said it would halt all flights to China, while Taiwan's China Airlines announced a further rescheduling of its flights to China from Friday to Feb. 10, canceling 5 flights and rearranging the schedules of others.
Taiwan's Eva Airways also said some flights to China may be canceled.
Germany's Lufthansa said on Monday bookings for its flights to and from China were slightly subdued due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it was reducing overnight layovers for crew at all points in mainland China as much as possible, resulting in some changes to its flight schedule.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

International SOS, a medical and travel security services firm that advises companies on travel, said its guidance for now was that business travel to China outside Hubei province could continue.
But this could be updated if there were major flight cancellations throughout China and more disruptions to ground transport, including rail, International SOS Regional Security Director James Robertson said.
""Many of our clients have chosen to defer or cancel upcoming travel based on their own individual assessments,"" Robertson said. ""If people do choose to travel they need flexible itineraries accounting for extra time for temperature and health screenings.""

WUHAN - The United States and other nations raced to get their citizens out of the locked-down Chinese city at ground-zero of a virus epidemic on Tuesday, as the death toll surged to 106 and the number of confirmed infections doubled to over 4,500.
The deadly virus, which experts believe emanated from a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan last month, has triggered a desperate Chinese containment effort after spreading nationwide and to more than a dozen other countries. 
The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in central Hubei province, effectively trapping more than 50 million people, including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the high-travel Lunar New Year holiday unfolds.
As those trapped in Wuhan have become increasingly anxious, governments have scrambled to devise ways to safely get their citizens out of the city of 11 million.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it? 

The United States, France and Japan are among those to have announced plans for airlifts, but nearly a week after the lockdown the evacuations have yet to happen.
A chartered US-bound flight had been scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens.
But the State Department said that had been postponed to Wednesday, without giving a reason.
France has also said it intends to fly its citizens out of the city in the middle of this week, and Japan has similar plans.

Several other countries also were working to repatriate their people, while Germany said it was considering doing so.
The virus can be transmitted between people, although scientists have yet to determine how contagious it is and exactly the way it is spread.
In bids to stop huge numbers of people coming into close contact with each other, China has imposed tight transport restrictions in other parts of the country.
It has extended the Lunar New Year national holiday into next week.
The education ministry on Tuesday also said the spring semester for schools and universities nationwide would be postponed, without giving a resumption date.
DEATH TOLL CLIMBS
Despite the unprecedented measures, the virus has showed little sign of slowing down.
The national health commission on Tuesday said 26 new deaths occurred in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total to 106. 
Confirmed infections in China also jumped to 4,515, it said, up from 2,744 on Monday.
There were nearly 7,000 more cases suspected and awaiting confirmation, according to the commission.
The virus has also continued to spread around the world.

On Monday, the first infections were confirmed in Germany, Canada and Sri Lanka.
Fears over containment were heightened on Sunday when Wuhan's mayor, wearing a medical mask, revealed at a press conference that 5 million people had left the city for other parts of the country during the massive travel rush that precedes the New Year holiday.
President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing ""any help that is necessary"" in combating the virus.
But the United States, Turkey, and Germany were among nations urging their citizens to ""reconsider"" all travel to China.
Malaysia on Monday banned visitors arriving from Hubei.
Landlocked Mongolia -- which is heavily dependent on trade with China -- took the drastic step of closing the border with its huge neighbor to cars.
Mongolia also cancelled classes until March 2 and suspended large public gatherings.
DESPERATE EFFORTS
Medical facilities have been overwhelmed in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town.
China has deployed hundreds of military medics to ease the pressure, and started building2 hospitals with the aim of finishing them in just 10 days.
AFP reporters saw hundreds of mask-wearing workers toiling around the clock to assemble one of the pre-fab field hospitals.

Construction began just days ago but the outline of a floor was already taking shape and electrical switchboards were up on Monday.
""We have to work fast to combat the epidemic,"" a worker in his 30s, who refused to give his name, told AFP.
Stressed Wuhan residents living under the quarantine expressed fears for the health and dwindling supplies at home.
""I'm getting more concerned every day,"" Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP.
FIGHTING SPIRIT
But Wuhan's people, who have a reputation in China for resilience, sought to project a fighting spirit.
Quarantined residents shouted ""Go Wuhan"" from their windows, according to videos posted online. 
A building lit up the night sky late on Monday with those words in red.

WHO says still probing if Chinese virus can spread before symptoms

The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted a more aggressive international response such as travel restrictions.
But the WHO on Monday admitted making an error in originally assessing the virus' worldwide threat as ""moderate,"" issuing an update late on Sunday to say the risk was actually ""high at the global level.""
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus traveled to Beijing this week for discussions with Chinese officials to coordinate on the crisis.

BEIJING - China on Tuesday postponed the start of the spring semester for schools and universities across the country over concerns about a novel virus outbreak.
The decision came as the death toll from the new coronavirus soared to 106 and the total number of cases surpassed 4,000 nationwide.
Students are currently on holiday for the Lunar New Year and the education ministry did not provide a date for teaching to resume.

Authorities on Monday decided to extend China's Lunar New Year holiday, originally due to end on Jan. 30, for 3 days to limit population flows and control the epidemic.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines stopped issuing visas on arrival to Chinese nationals on Tuesday, in a bid to keep the southeast Asian nation free of a new virus that has killed 106 and infected more than 4,500 since emerging in China in December.
There have been no confirmed cases in the Philippines since the coronavirus outbreak began in China's central city of Wuhan, but infections have been confirmed in Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.
""We are taking this proactive measure to slow down travel, and possibly help prevent the entry of the 2019-nCoV,"" Jaime Morente, the commissioner of the Philippines' Bureau of Immigration, said in a statement, referring to the virus.
There is no order barring Chinese nationals from entering the Philippines, however, Morente said.
He did not say when the facility would be resumed. Chinese nationals can still apply for visas at any Philippine embassy or consulate at their places of residence.
Health authorities are monitoring more than 11 suspected cases of the new coronavirus, they said on Tuesday.
The ""visa upon arrival"" facility has been offered to Chinese nationals since 2017, in an effort to boost tourism. Those eligible included investors and businessmen, athletes, delegates to international conventions and tour groups.
Chinese tourists accounted for 22 percent of the 7.5 million visitors to the Philippines between January and November last year, making China the second top nation of origin for international travelers to the country.

TORONTO/BENGALURU, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Canada on Saturday declared the first ""presumptive"" confirmed case of the deadly coronavirus in a resident who had returned from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak of the viral disease.
Ontario health officials told a news conference the patient is a male in his 50s, who arrived in Toronto on Jan. 22 and was hospitalized the next day after developing symptoms of respiratory illness.
Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, told reporters that the man is being treated in a public hospital and is in a stable condition.
Ontario health officials are investigating the details of the man's contact with others since arriving in Toronto. Early indications are that he took private transportation home after arriving at Toronto airport and then paramedics brought him to the hospital, they added.
The health officials said it is a relatively small family situation, though they declined to give a number, and there is very little by way of contact. They said his family members have been put into self isolation.
Officials said the results from the provincial laboratory confirming the positive case arrived earlier on Saturday. Once the results from the local laboratory are confirmed by Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, the case will be declared the country's first confirmed case of coronavirus.
Canada is on high alert to prevent the spread of coronavirus and avoid the repeat of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that killed 44 people in Canada, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus in 2002-2003. Government health officials say Canada is better prepared this time.
The deadly coronavirus has infected more than 1,975 people and killed at least 56 in China.

WUHAN (2nd UPDATE) - China on Sunday expanded drastic travel restrictions to contain a viral contagion that has killed 56 people and infected nearly 2,000, as the United States and France prepared to evacuate their citizens from a quarantined city at the outbreak's epicenter.
China has locked down the hard-hit province of Hubei in the country's center in an unprecedented operation affecting tens of millions of people to slow the spread of a respiratory illness that President Xi Jinping said posed a ""grave"" threat.
Outside the epicenter, three cities, including Beijing, and an eastern province announced bans on long-distance buses from entering or leaving their borders.
Originating in Hubei's capital of Wuhan, the virus has spread throughout China and around the world, with cases confirmed in around a dozen countries as distant as France, Australia and the United States.
The US State Department said on Sunday it was arranging a flight to repatriate staff at its Wuhan consulate and other American citizens trapped in the city.
The flight departs Wuhan on Tuesday for San Francisco, it said in an email to Americans in China, while warning of ""extremely limited"" capacity for private citizens.
France's government and the French carmaker PSA -- which has a sizable presence in Wuhan -- also said they were formulating plans to evacuate staff and relatives, who would be taken to a city in a neighboring province for a quarantine period.
Sri Lanka said its Beijing embassy was considering action regarding its nationals in Wuhan.
TRAVEL BANS
China would normally be celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday this week, but Wuhan's eerie quarantine calm deepened on Sunday as new restrictions banned most road traffic in the metropolis of 11 million.
Loudspeakers offered tips slathered with bravado.
""Do not believe in rumors. Do not spread rumors. If you feel unwell, go to the hospital in time,"" the message said.
""Wuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,"" the female voice added, mentioning the deadly 2002-03 SARS epidemic and 1998 Yangtze River flooding.
Israt Zahan, a Bangladeshi doctoral candidate living in Wuhan said she and other students were staying in their homes as it was ""too risky"" to go outside.
""The bustling city looks like a ghost town from my window. The shops are all shut down. I am rationing the food at my home. It will last for two days. Then I don't know what I would do,"" she told AFP by phone.
Despite anxious scenes at crowded hospitals in recent days, there were no signs of panic in the city. 
But defenses were bolstered elsewhere in the country.
Beijing suspended long-distance bus services into and out of the capital beginning Sunday. Similar suspensions are planned for the entire eastern province of Shandong -- home to 100 million people -- plus the northern cities of Tianjin and Xi'an.
The southern city of Shantou had announced a ban on vehicles entering its jurisdiction after detecting two cases, but authorities later reversed the decision.
Overseas Chinese tour groups will be suspended from Monday while domestic trips have already been halted since Friday.
In the semi-autonomous southern city of Hong Kong, Disneyland announced Sunday it had closed as a precaution following the government's declaration of an emergency to combat the crisis. Shanghai's Disneyland park had already closed Saturday.
VIRUS SPREAD 'ACCELERATING'
The nationwide death toll rose to 56 after 15 new deaths, most of them in Hubei.
Shanghai on Sunday reported its first death -- an 88-year-old man who had pre-existing health problems.
It was the first death reported in an internationally connected major Chinese city outside of Wuhan, where the outbreak is believed to have originated in a market where animals like rats, snakes and hedgehogs were sold as food.
The government says most deaths involved the elderly or people already weakened by pre-existing health conditions.
Fearing a repeat of SARS, China has dramatically scaled back celebrations and travel associated with the New Year holiday, which began Friday, while tourist sites like Beijing's Forbidden City and a section of the Great Wall have closed as a precaution. 
Xi said at a Communist Party leadership meeting on the crisis that China was ""faced with the grave situation of an accelerating spread"" of the virus, calling for stepped-up prevention.
Measures have been ordered nationwide to detect and isolate people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses.
In Wuhan, China's military has dispatched 450 medics, many with experience combating infectious diseases, to help treat patients in the city, many of whom reported hours-long waits at overwhelmed hospitals.
Wuhan is racing to build two makeshift virus-focused field hospitals within a fortnight to ease the pressure. The first could be ready in just over a week.

WUHAN - The Chinese army deployed medical specialists Saturday to the epicenter of a spiraling viral outbreak that has killed 41 people and spread around the world, as millions spent their normally festive Lunar New Year holiday under lockdown.
The country's most important celebration has been all but canceled for some 56 million people as authorities expanded travel bans in central Hubei province, now affecting 18 cities.
On Saturday, when they should have been celebrating, citizens of Wuhan stood in line at a pharmacy to buy masks from employees in full-body protective suits and surgical gloves.
On the eastern outskirts of Wuhan -- Hubei's capital and the source of the previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -- police manning a roadblock turned away a handful of vehicles trying to exit the city. 
""Nobody can leave,"" an officer told AFP.
But the police allowed some medical workers who had gone home for the holidays to re-enter the city to help at overwhelmed hospitals.
""They need us to go there, otherwise they will be too exhausted,"" said one of the women, pulling a suitcase.
But the respiratory contagion continues to spread.
The nationwide death toll has jumped to 41, the government said Saturday, after 15 more people died in Wuhan.

China virus death toll jumps to 41, cases soar to nearly 1,300

Confirmed infections also surged to 1,287, up from 830 reported 24 hours earlier. Most of the deaths and overall cases have been in Hubei.
In a dramatic escalation of the central government's involvement, China deployed 450 military medical staff to Wuhan, state media said.
The medics, who arrived on military aircraft late Friday, include doctors with experience combating SARS or Ebola and will be dispatched to hospitals that are reportedly short on beds due to a crush of infected patients and worried locals.
The National Health Commission also ordered nationwide measures to detect people carrying the virus on planes, trains and buses across the country.
PROTECT YOURSELF
""Everyone is just trying to protect themselves,"" said a man in a surgical mask at a Wuhan pharmacy where customers were stocking up on masks, gloves and disinfectant.
But the man, who declined to give his name, expressed confidence in Chinese authorities.
""The government is handling this. It's not a problem.""
The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002 to 2003 and spread to a number of other countries.
It has now spread nationwide and to a dozen other countries, with France saying 3 cases had been confirmed there -- the first known European infections.

France confirms first three cases of coronavirus in Europe 

Australia and Malaysia on Saturday became the latest countries to confirm infections.
Beijing's Forbidden City, Shanghai Disneyland, and a section of the Great Wall are among many attractions that have closed as a precaution.
The New Year is usually a joyous occasion for family reunions, but not for many in Wuhan.
""Usually we celebrate as a family. Now, because of the virus I'm not even visiting my parents,"" said Wang Fang, a 49-year-old Wuhan native.
""It'll be great just to be able to make it through (the outbreak).""
TRUMP PRAISE
China's aggressive response has won praise, especially compared to its handling of SARS, when it was accused of reacting sluggishly and stonewalling the international community.
""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,"" US President Donald Trump tweeted, hours after the United States confirmed its second case.
""The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency,"" he added.
""It will all work out well.""
The virus emerged at a bad time for containment, with hundreds of millions of Chinese rushing home for the holiday.
The timing could limit the economic impact, however, since much of China normally shuts down during the roughly week-long break.
The outbreak emerged in late December, traced to a Wuhan seafood and live animal market that sold a vast range of exotic animals and other bushmeat.

'This time I'm scared': Experts fear too late for China virus lockdown 

The World Health Organization on Thursday stopped short of declaring a global emergency, which would have prompted greater international cooperation, including possible trade and travel restrictions.
Wuhan resembles a ghost town due to the clampdown, but hospitals bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits.
The city's Guiyuan Temple is normally thronged for the Lunar New Year with tens of thousands of devotees paying respects to a deity associated with wealth.
But police manning a roadblock on Saturday turned away AFP journalists, saying the temple was closed to prevent the virus spread.
Authorities began building a new field hospital in Wuhan to deal with the outbreak, which state media said could be ready in 10 days.

SYDNEY - Australia confirmed on Saturday its first 4 cases of the new coronavirus that has claimed 41 lives in China, becoming the latest country in a growing list to be affected by the illness.
One man was being treated in isolation after arriving in Melbourne a week ago from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
He has pneumonia but is in a stable condition, health officials said.
Three other men in Sydney who also arrived recently from China had tested positive for the disease and were in isolation in local hospitals.
""They are not particularly unwell,"" New South Wales state chief health officer Kerry Chant told a press conference.
She said public health officials had managed to track most of the people who had been with 2 of the men on their flights from China and none were showing symptoms of the illness.
Officials were still trying to trace the travel of the other man and are waiting on test results from several other people suspected of contracting the disease.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard praised the 3 men in Sydney for approaching doctors once their symptoms arose. 
Authorities in Queensland state said 5 other people had been cleared after they were suspected of infection.
The previously unknown 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is thought to have originated in a market in Wuhan where exotic animals and bushmeat were sold.
It has infected around 1,300 people in China and spread to almost a dozen other countries, including France and the United States.

The global spread of the coronavirus: Where is it?

The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002 to 2003.
Health experts say some human-to-human transmission has been recorded, particularly in Wuhan, a city of 11 million now under lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of the disease.
Australian health minister Greg Hunt said passengers who traveled on the same Melbourne-bound plane as the infected man were being contacted ""to provide them with information and advice.""

BEIJING -- Chinese movie fans can catch the premier of much-anticipated new comedy this holiday weekend under a 630 million yuan ($91.25 million) deal to issue the film over the internet, as fears of a deadly new virus keep audiences away from cinemas.
The Hong Kong-listed Huanxi Media Group announced on Friday an agreement with Beijing Bytedance Network to show its new movie ""Lost in Russia"" on Bytedance's online platforms.
Bytedance, which owns the popular TikTok video-sharing app and the news app Jinri Toutiao, said given the efforts to reduce the risks of big gatherings, it had secured the deal to let fans watch ""Lost in Russia"" for free on its apps.
""The film will keep the appointment to meet everyone on Jan. 25, but the meeting point has changed to your cellphone and television, instead of the cinema,"" the company said in a statement posted on Jinri Toutiao.
Huanxi Media's share price rose as much as 30 percent after the agreement was announced.
Neither ByteDance nor Huanxi responded to requests for comment on their agreement.

BEIJING -- China on Friday confirmed a second death outside the epicenter of a SARS-like virus outbreak that has infected hundreds of people, raising the overall toll to 26 dead.
Officials say 24 deaths have occurred in Hubei, the central province that is home to Wuhan, the city identified as the center of the outbreak.
The death was in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia and is some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) from Wuhan, the local government said.
It follows confirmation Thursday of the first death outside the epicenter -- an 80-year-old man diagnosed with the new virus in northern Hebei province, who died on Jan. 22.

TAIPEI—Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen called on China on Wednesday to share ""correct"" information about a new coronavirus and for the World Health Organization (WHO) not to exclude Taiwan from collaboration on the outbreak for political reasons.
Authorities have confirmed more than 400 cases of the virus in China, most of them in the central city of Wuhan where the virus first appeared at the end of 2019. Nine people have died.
The virus, which health officials have said can be passed from person to person, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai, with cases have been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, as well as Taiwan.

China warns virus could mutate and spread as death toll rises 

Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers the island a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations unless it accepts it is part of China.
Tsai, speaking to reporters after Taiwan's Tuesday confirmation of its first case of the coronavirus, a woman returning to Taiwan from Wuhan, said China had to live up to its international obligations.
Tsai said she hoped for transparency and that China would ""share with Taiwan correct information about the virus.""
""This is also beneficial for China's people. We believe that political considerations should not come before safeguarding people,"" she said.
Taiwan was a part of the international community and faced the same health challenges and risks as everyone, Tsai said.
""I again call on the WHO not to exclude Taiwan due to political factors. Taiwan is at the forefront of global epidemic prevention. There needs to be room at the WHO for Taiwan's participation.""

Taiwan reports first case of new SARS-like virus 

Relations between Taipei and Beijing have nosedived since Tsai took office in 2016, with China suspecting her of pushing for the island's formal independence. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, it's formal name.
The WHO office in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in an email to Reuters on Tuesday that Taiwan was being kept informed.
""Taiwanese authorities, including health experts, are being informed through cross-strait channels as well as channels connected with the International Health Regulations. WHO is informed that there is cross-strait contact on this matter.""
The deputy head of China's National Health Commission, Li Bin, told reporters in Beijing earlier that experts from Taiwan had been invited to visit Wuhan and the island was being provided with information.
Taiwan has advised people not to visit Wuhan unless they absolutely have to and has suspended tourist groups from the city from visiting the island.

Taiwan tells people not to go to Wuhan amid China virus outbreak 

Despite political tension, Taiwan and China have close business ties, with billions invested in China by Taiwanese businesses such as Foxconn, a key supplier to Apple .
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has asked employees from its Wuhan plant in China who are in Taiwan for the Lunar New Year holidays to stay at home given the coronavirus outbreak in the city.
Since the outbreak, Foxconn workers in Wuhan have been wearing face masks and getting their temperature checked, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer said.
Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Foxconn, advised employees not to visit China over the holiday.
""The speed of contagion will be no less than SARS,"" he said at a party for the Lunar New Year in Taipei, referring to a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 to 2003.
""I advise everyone not to go to the mainland for this coming new year holiday,"" he said.

How the new coronavirus developed 

Management has to decide whether employees need to return to Wuhan to work after new year, Gou said, adding Foxconn would come up with solutions for employees to work remotely.
Lunar New Year is the biggest holiday in the Chinese-speaking world, when millions of people travel for family reunions in what is the world's largest annual human migration.

BEIJING—The Chinese city at the center of a SARS-like virus outbreak has urged people to stay away, canceling a major Lunar New Year event, as it strives to contain a disease that has spread across the country.
The death toll from the virus, which first emerged in the central city of Wuhan, has reached 9 while more than 400 people have now been infected in 13 provinces and municipalities.

China warns virus could mutate and spread as death toll rises

The disease is spreading just as hundreds of millions of people are traveling in packed trains, planes and buses across China to gather with friends and family for the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts on Friday.
Wuhan's mayor Zhou Xianwang urged residents to not leave the city and visitors to avoid it so that the possibility of transmission can be reduced.
""If it's not necessary we suggest that people don't come to Wuhan,"" Zhou told state broadcaster CCTV.
Fever scanners have been set up at the city's train station and airport and officials check the temperatures of drivers at highway checkpoints, while outbound tour groups have been banned from leaving the city of 11 million people.
The National Health Commission announced measures on Wednesday to curb the spread, including disinfection and ventilation at airports and bus stations as well as inside planes and trains.
The vast majority of cases have been found in Wuhan, where a seafood market that illegally sold wild animals is the primary suspect for the outbreak.
The virus, which can be transmitted between humans and could mutate, has also infected people in other countries including the US, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.

How the new coronavirus developed

The Wuhan government said in a notice Tuesday that it will cancel activities during China's Lunar New Year holiday, the most important event in the Chinese calendar.
Wuhan has canceled the annual prayer-giving at the city's Guiyuan Temple and has closed the temple—which attracted 700,000 tourists during last year's holiday.
This year, city authorities said 30,000 tourists had already booked tickets to new year celebrations and 200,000 free event coupons had been distributed.
The Wuhan New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Prevention and Control Headquarters said it would cancel public events that were not ""necessary.""
All local artistic and theater performances have been canceled, it said, and the museum is closed. It has also pulled plans to send opera troupes around rural areas during the holiday.
Tour groups leaving the city have also been cancelled.
Police are conducting spot checks for live poultry or wild animals in vehicles exiting and entering the city.
""We already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals,"" Gao Fu, director of the Chinese center for disease control and prevention, said at a press conference on Wednesday.
""This might be the cause, so the disease could be on an animal, and then passed on from this animal to a human.""

BEIJING — China warned Wednesday that a SARS-like virus that has killed nine people, infected hundreds and spread to other countries could mutate, as authorities scrambled to contain the disease during the Lunar New Year travel season.
The new coronavirus has caused alarm for its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.
The illness is transmitted via the respiratory tract and there ""is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease,"" National Health Commission vice minister Li Bin said at a news conference in Beijing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was to hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has also been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan and South Korea.
The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel.
But they still have not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus, which has infected 440 people in 13 provinces and municipalities.
""We will step up research efforts to identify the source and transmission of the disease,"" Li said.
A prominent expert from China's National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people.
However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak, as a seafood market where live animals were sold in the central city of Wuhan was identified as ground zero for the virus.
Countries have been intensifying efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen -- known by its technical name 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -- as the number of cases jumped, raising concerns in the middle of a major Chinese holiday travel rush.
This week, China celebrates the Lunar New Year, the most important event in the Chinese calendar with hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country to celebrate with family.
CONTAINMENT MEASURES 
On Wednesday, the commission announced measures to contain the disease, including disinfection and ventilation at airports, train stations and shopping centers.
""When needed, temperature checks will also be implemented in key areas at crowded places,"" the commission said in a statement.
Wuhan has urged people to stay away in a bid to contain its spread.
Police were conducting spot checks for live poultry or wild animals in vehicles leaving and entering the city, state media said.
The local government has cancelled public activities during the holiday, including the annual prayer-giving at the city's Guiyan Temple -- which attracted 700,000 tourists during last year's holiday.
Tour groups heading out of the city have also been cancelled.
