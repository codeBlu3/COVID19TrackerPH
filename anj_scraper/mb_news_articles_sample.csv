2,,"March 1, 2020, 4:19 PM",nCov,Central Visayas remains COVID-19 free; Bohol gov appeals for kindness to tourists,By Minerva Newman,"By Minerva Newman CEBU CITY — The Department of Health in Region 7 (DOH-7) declared in a press conference Friday that Cebu, and Central Visayas remained coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-safe, and asked public to refrain from posting unverified information on social media about the virus.  Bohol Governor Arthur Yap (MANILA BULLETIN FILE PHOTO) DOH-7 medical program coordinator for infectious diseases Dr. Van Philip Baton told media that the 26 South Koreans from Daegu City who arrived in Cebu several hours before the travel ban from Korea was implemented, “were asymptomatic and they were advised to stay in their respective hotel rooms” and placed under self-quarantine. “They are classified as persons under monitoring (PUMs),” Baton clarified, while adding that sharing and posting of unverified claims on social media should never be the cause of cancellations of hotel/resorts bookings. According to Carlo Suarez, president of Hotel Resort and Restaurants Association in Cebu (HRRAC), all hotels and resorts in Cebu were COVID-19-safe, and that they continue to closely coordinate with DOH, Cebu province, Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) and the Bureau of Immigration (BI) so that all quarantine/health screening protocols are being followed. “We are all on top of this situation,” Suarez added. Stay kind, compassionate and caring to tourists “Stay kind to tourists amid virus scare.” This was Bohol Governor Arthur Yap’s appeal to Boholanos. Yap said that even when their numbers are falling globally, tourists have kept coming to Bohol despite the COVID-19 scare. This, he said, was a testament to Boholano hospitality. Yap called for a Sangguniang Panlalawigan (SP) session on February 27 to put his appeal on-record through a resolution, which the council approved immediately. “Maintaining an attitude of compassion and care for all tourists must be without discrimination, whether local, Chinese, Korean or of other nationalities and any form of discrimination towards anyone will do more harm than good to public interest,” the resolution read. Mitigating measures The Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI) appealed to all sectors of the business community and the government to unite and work together to take drastic measures that can contribute to mitigate the ill effects of CORVID-19 outbreak to the social, economic and business growth of Central Visayas. CCCI president Virgilio Espeleta, in a media statement Friday, said that, in view of the urgency and the worsening COVID-19 outbreak,  “we urge for a multi-stakeholder support and collaboration in finding ways to help each other survive by reaching a consensus on how we could move forward as one.” Espeleta said that CCI strongly recommended the following measures which were also adopted by the Regional Development Council (RDC-7) through a resolution during its full council meeting on February 28 in Cebu:   Tags: ncov"

World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attends a daily press briefing on COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, at the WHO headquaters on February 28, 2020, in Geneva.  (Photo by Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP / file photo / MANILA BULLETIN) The global risk level has been raised because of, first, the “difficulty in identifying cases due to non-specific symptoms and the potential of undetected transmission,” and second, the “potential for major impact on healthcare systems in some affected and potentially affected countries,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Twitter. He also cited the “spread of the new coronavirus and countries’ capacity to respond” as the basis for raising the risk level and said WHO risk assessments have been shared with public health authorities, including through the International Health Regulations Event Information Site. “The assessments are undertaken and updated regularly to inform decision-making and planning,” he said, adding that the risk within China remains unchanged as “very high.” “WHO is currently working closely with partner agencies for human/animal health,” said Tedros. “We’re waiting for further results from Hong Kong as health officials investigate the reported presence of COVID-19 in one pet dog.” According to reports, a dog in Hong Kong has tested positive for COVID-19, but local scientists are not sure if the dog was actually infected or if it picked up the virus from a contaminated surface. “Past experience with coronaviruses and our current understanding of COVID-19 do not indicate that common household pets spread the disease or make people sick. We will provide further updates as we learn more,” the WHO chief said. Tags: ncov"

(MANILA BULLETIN) Citing data from the International Health Regulation, Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the new case involved a 41-year-old Filipina. “Sa ngayon naka-admit sya sa isang hospital sa Singapore at binabantayan [Currently, she is admitted in a hospital in Singapore and is being monitored]. She’s in stable condition,” Vergeire said in a television interview. Last February 23, the Department of Foreign Affairs reported the first Filipino who tested positive for COVID-19 in the said country. Of the overall figure of infected Filipinos outside the Philippines, 80 of them were from the M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship, said Vergeire. Sixty-four of them remain admitted in various medical facilities in Japan, while the 16 others have already recovered and were discharged. The health official added that two Filipinos in the United Arab Emirates have contracted the disease, there are also two in Hong Kong, and the two cases in Singapore. The DOH last Friday assured that the Philippine government “remains at their service and would devotedly extend assistance.” In a related development, Vergeire said that 10 repatriates from the M/V Diamond Princess cruise ship, who are in quarantine at New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac, have shown symptoms of respiratory illness. However, seven of them have already tested negative for COVID-19. The test results of the three others remain pending. To note, there were 458 Filipinos currently quarantined at the Athlete’s Village in NCC, including the 13 members of the Philippine repatriation team. “Ang lahat ng NCC repatriates na nanggaling sa M/V Diamond Princess bago sila bumaba o nagdisembark sa barko from Japan ay tinest sila lahat. Sila lahat ay nagnegatibo…So ngayon ang protocol natin sa NCC quarantine facility kapag sila ay magkakasintomas, that’s the time na dadalhin sila sa referral hospital at itetest [The repatriates in NCC were tested for COVID-19 before they disembarked the M/V Diamond Princess in Japan. They all tested negative then. Our protocol in the NCC quarantine facility, if they showed symptoms (of respiratory illness) then they will be brought to our referral hospital and will be tested,” said Vergeire. Tags: ncov"
